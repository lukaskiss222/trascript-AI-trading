(Operator Instructions) I will now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s conference call, Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations of the Walt Disney Company.\nLowell Singer: I want to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter 2007 call. Today\u2019s call is being webcast and the webcast can be accessed on our Investor Relations website. The press release was issued a few minutes ago and is now available on the website, and we will also provide a replay of the call, as well as a MP3 file and an archived, written transcript of today\u2019s remarks on the website. We\u2019re actually in New York for today\u2019s call and here with me are Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tom Staggs, our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob is going to lead off; Tom will follow up with some comments and then we\u2019ll open up the call to your questions. I hope you will stick around after the Q&A, because I am going to read through some very exciting changes to our safe harbor provision that I think you\u2019ll really enjoy. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Bob.\nRobert A. Iger: Good afternoon. I\u2019m pleased to report that we\u2019ve had another year of outstanding financial results. We posted record net income, record segment operating income and record earnings per share for our 2007 fiscal year, bolstered by a strong fourth quarter performance. These results stem directly from our emphasis on the creation of high-quality content across all of our businesses, backed up by clear strategy for maximizing the value of that content across platforms and markets. Our performance over the last two years highlights the Disney difference; unique factors we believe can create sustainable shareholder value and which set us apart from our entertainment industry peers. At Disney, we have strong, recognizable and relevant brands that help us to cut through an increasingly cluttered media landscape, getting us on train to new platforms and new geographical markets and giving us access to more consumers. Disney, ABC and ESPN are each managed in a highly-integrated manner, allowing us to maximize the value of our hit creative properties and, in the case of Disney in particular, to extend them as franchises. We have at our disposal, unrivaled promotional power through our many distribution outlets. This gives us a tremendous advantage in executing our core strategies of creating high-quality, creative content and experiences; of using technology to expand consumer access and reaching into promising, high-growth international markets. We believe it allows us to reduce risk and to manage through economic cycles with a higher degree of certainty than our peers. Perhaps the most prominent example of the Disney difference at work is Disney Channel\u2019s High School Musical, which has set global performance records across multiple categories, becoming ubiquitous on stage, screens, online, in-stores and even on ice, and having a positive financial impact across all of our divisions. The sequel, High School Musical 2 debuted in August to the largest ever audience for a cable broadcast, and to date, some 100 million viewers worldwide have tuned into the movie. Then, there\u2019s Hannah Montana, another bona fide cultural phenomenon, now the number one cable series for kids 6 to 14. Hannah has also yielded two number one records, a sold-out national concert tour and a winning merchandise line that encompasses everything from video games to Halloween costumes. High School Musical and Hannah Montana speak to our tremendous ability to create and grow new franchises. Great Disney content can live on for generations. The platinum edition DVD release of our 18-year-old film Little Mermaid last year was a huge hit with consumers, selling 9 million copies worldwide, and setting up the arrival of the Broadway stage show which opens next month. This past year brought many examples of how we\u2019re building on and extending the lives of some of our favorite franchise properties, from the hit Disney Channel series for preschoolers, My Friends Tigger and Pooh, to DisneyFairies.com where kids have created nearly 3.3 million fairies of their own. We will soon open Toy Story mania at Disney\u2019s California Adventure and at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios in Orlando, where families will get reacquainted with Woody, Buzz and the gang in a 3-D interactive environment. Fans of Pirates of the Caribbean can now test their wits against Jack Sparrow and his crew at our recently launched, massively multi-player Disney.com Virtual World. Our studio posted its highest operating income in its history, while releasing substantially fewer movies than in recent years. Pirates of the Caribbean: At World\u2019s End was the number one movie of the year globally and at nearly $1 billion in box office \u2013 the fifth highest grossing movie of all time. Ratatouille, the best reviewed movie of the year, has just passed $580 million in worldwide box office, breaking several European box office records and making it the third highest grossing Pixar movie. The studio also had solid comedy hits with Wild Hogs and The Game Plan. DVD, Blu-ray and digital sales of Pirates and Ratatouille are rolling out now through the holiday season, and we are very enthusiastic about several up-coming films, including Enchanted, which opens on the 21st; our Christmas release, National Treasure: Book of Secrets, and for next year, the second installment of our Narnia series, Prince Caspian, and WALL\u2022E, another Pixar tale with an unusual protagonist. The addition of the Pixar team has helped us sustain a creative hot streak that\u2019s had huge benefits across the company, as had the full incorporation of their great characters and stories in our franchise portfolio, particularly in our parks and resorts. Our parks and resorts unit had yet another solid year, increasing attendance and benefiting from higher per capita spending. The Year of a Million Dreams campaign has resonated with our consumers; so much so, we are extending it for a second year. Walt Disney Imagineering is constantly incorporating new technologies in our attractions, such as the newly opened Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage at Disneyland. We\u2019re making a significant investment in success of the Disneyland Resort by expanding Disney\u2019s California Adventure over the next several years, adding new family attractions, entertainment, and an entirely new land, Cars Land, which makes real the virtual world of our hit movie, and the source of one of our best-selling license merchandise lines. We\u2019re also launching several projects that give consumers the opportunity to enjoy high-quality Disney family experiences outside of our parks. We\u2019re building two new spectacular cruise ships and developing a new resort at a stunning Hawaiian location. New Disney Vacation Club properties at that resort and at the Grand California Hotel at Disneyland Resort will build on the great success we\u2019re having with that business and the trust consumers have in the Disney vacation brand. We\u2019re also very gratified by the performance of our broadcast and cable networks, at a time of sweeping change in the way consumers seek and enjoy their entertainment. I remarked earlier on the amazing success of the Disney Channel, but our emphasis on great content and innovative application of technology is allowing us to reach more people, more often, across the multiple digital platforms that now make up the ABC network and ESPN. This emphasis is critical as we compete for an audience which has unlimited entertainment options. ABC\u2019s fall season is off to a good start, with the network leading its rivals by a wide margin with young, upscale adults and benefiting from a strong scatter market. New shows Private Practice, Pushing Daisies, Dirty Sexy Money and Samantha Who? are bolstering our already solid lineup of primetime programming that includes Grey\u2019s Anatomy, Desperate Housewives, Ugly Betty and Dancing with the Stars. For the first six weeks of the fall season, we have five of the top seven rated new primetime shows, including the number one new drama and number one new comedy, both produced by ABC Studios. In fact, Samantha Who? is currently the season\u2019s most-watched sitcom, new or returning. In the years since ABC.com Player was launched, viewers have started around 160 million episodes, adding to 33 million downloads of our shows purchased on the iTunes store. These viewers are younger, more affluent and boast an impressive ad recall rate. By pairing our great content with these digital technologies we are creating a more direct connection with the consumer, delivering more targeted messages for advertisers, and collecting better information about who our consumers are and what they want. ESPN, the number one worldwide brand in sports media, has been a pioneer in unlocking value by using digital technology to create new fan experiences. In fiscal 2007, ESPN again produced strong growth on the basis of the compelling cross-platform programming it creates, for everything from the NFL to NASCAR. ESPN continues to build its brand internationally, this past year acquiring key multi-media properties in sports like rugby and cricket, as well as the leading cable broadcaster of US sports in Europe. Our push-the-harness digital technology on behalf of consumers took a giant leap forward earlier this year, when we launched the all-new Disney.com. Already the number one family website, Disney.com is reaching over 20 million monthly unique visitors and has become a great showcase for concerts, special events and immersive virtual worlds, filled with Disney characters and stories. Our acquisition of Club Penguin, a highly successful kids\u2019 virtual world site, adds an exciting new dimension to Disney\u2019s Internet efforts, and gives us a great new franchise to build upon. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that we are making solid progress in building our console gaming business \u2013 another promising creative engine for Disney. In fiscal 2007, we acquired several specialty games studios and shipped a record 20 million published and licensed games, with the focus shifting increasingly to what we create and develop ourselves. We are now the number one game-maker after Nintendo for its DS system, the most popular player among pre-teens. Disney is also rapidly expanding its global reach; we\u2019ve successfully penetrated some of the world\u2019s most promising markets. In India, we now have three popular television channels, a growing consumer products operation and a green light to Hindi language animated films. In China, where the media market remains restricted, we now have 4800 Disney retail corners, our flagship Hong Kong theme park and the hit TV show In Mickey Mouse Playhouse. In Russia, a combination of television program sales and live shows is bringing Disney into people\u2019s lives like never before. We believe great popular entertainment created locally is increasingly what audiences want; our first film made for the Chinese market, Secret of the Magic Gourd was broadly distributed during last summer\u2019s school holidays and warmly received by audiences. We plan to invest $100 million in such locally-made films over the next 2 to 3 years. We remain committed to financial discipline, investing in those areas where we can deliver superior returns. Our improved results have led to improved returns on invested capital, which are a clear reflection of our ability combine creative excellence with a sharp focus on the bottom line. We have an agile, experienced management team, an unparalleled portfolio of creative assets and a clear strategic vision for maximizing returns. The Disney brand has never been stronger; it is clear from our 2007 results, from what we are hearing from consumers worldwide, and it is perhaps best illustrated by a strong portfolio of franchises that has delivered our recent growth and we expect will deliver growth for the years to come. We thank you very much for your support, and with that, I will turn things over to Tom Staggs.\nThomas O. Staggs: Thank you for joining us on the call today. We use three key financial metrics to assess our company\u2019s overall performance and to gauge how well our strategic initiatives are translating into delivering value for our shareholders: earnings per share, return on invested capital, and free cash flow. We\u2019re pleased to report solid performance against all three measures again in fiscal 2007. As importantly, these results were driven by strong performance throughout the company, as we capitalized on creative successes across our many lines of business. Our media networks were the biggest driver of our growth, for both the full year and the fourth quarter, led once again by ESPN. ESPN benefited in the fourth quarter from the timing of revenue deferral, as we recognized $188 million more in deferred revenues than we did in the prior year. In addition, ESPN\u2019s ad sales were up 30% in Q4 versus the prior year, and we\u2019re up double digits even if we exclude the benefit we received from the addition of NASCAR events to our schedule. Disney Channel also continues to be a great success story for us. Disney Channel\u2019s total day ratings for the key demos were up over 12% this year versus last, and in the fourth quarter, Disney Channel had the second highest quarterly primetime total viewer ratings ever across all cable networks. By the way the highest quarterly mark was set by ESPN in fiscal Q1 of this year. Of course Disney Channel\u2019s creative success helped drive growth in other businesses, like music and merchandising, and also fueled the expansion of the Channel and the Disney brand around the world. In broadcasting, ABC Studios hit shows drove demand across the platforms and syndication windows, helping broadcasting deliver fiscal year operating growth of 48%. Broadcasting results were down somewhat in Q4 due to syndication sales of According to Jim and Scrubs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, as well as the previous shut-down of the Disney MVNO and the absence of the ABC show Lost on DVD in Q4 of this year. For Lost fans out there, the third season DVD will be available on December 11th. Also in the fourth quarter, the strong ad market resulted in TPMs that were significant double-digits above upfront levels, which together with higher sold inventory largely offset the impact of softer ratings at the network. As Bob mentioned, Studio Entertainment delivered record profit this year on the strength of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man\u2019s Chest and Cars on DVD. Over the last few years, we have reduced our overall investment in film, while focusing more on Disney-branded movies and the Studio\u2019s success in 2007 helps demonstrate the benefits of that approach. As we expected, Studio Entertainment operating income declined in the fourth quarter given the difficult comp created by the theatrical release of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man\u2019s Chest in the fourth quarter of 2006, and the roughly 20% decline in home video unit sales driven by a higher number of catalogue title sales in the fourth quarter of last year. We\u2019re also extremely pleased with the continued strong performance of our parks and resorts. For the full year operating profit was up 11%; segment margins improved by 60 basis points. The success of the Year of Million Dreams marketing initiative in our domestic parks helped them achieve record attendance in 2007. Disneyland Paris also generated record attendance, driven by new Pixar-based attractions and their 15th anniversary celebration. In the fourth quarter, combined attendance at our domestic parks grew 5%, led by increases at Walt Disney World, which more than offset a modest decline at Disneyland versus the tough comps created by our 50th anniversary last year. Guest spending at our domestic resorts grew 2%, while Disney World occupancies were up roughly 7 percentage points to 90%, with Disneyland\u2019s occupancy level coming in very close to Q4 of last year at 91%. Per room spending increased by 2% across our domestic resorts. As we discussed, Hong Kong Disneyland has been less successful initially than we had hoped; however we continue to believe in the potential of this property and we anticipate additional investment in the park to help drive its success. At consumer products, merchandise licensing continues to drive our performance as successful Disney releases and Disney Channel shows enable us to diversify and strengthen our product portfolio. Robust demand for Cars, Pirates, High School Musical and Hannah Montana products contributed to double-digit increases in earned royalties for the fourth quarter and for the year. We are pleased in the results for 2007 but as you would expect, our attention is focused on continuing that success. Although we do not give earnings guidance I would like to touch on some of the factors that will likely influence our results in 2008. Concerns over the economy and more specifically over travel and tourism and the ad market are considerations for many companies this year. While these factors can certainly impact our 2008 results, thus far, our businesses remain strong and we have not seen indication of a downturn. At our domestic theme parks, rooms on the books and attendance-to-date for the first quarter fiscal 2008 are currently mid-single digit percentages ahead of last year. At media networks, the advertising marketplace remains very healthy. ABC\u2019s scatter pricing in the first quarter 2008 is running strong double-digit percentages ahead of upfront pricing. While some of that shrink in scatter pricing is driven by tightening supply, underlying demand in the marketplace is very strong. Advertising in our cable networks is also solid, with ad sales coming up double-digits in the first quarter. Now it\u2019s premature to speculate on any financial impact from the Writer\u2019s Guild strike; however, in the event of an extended walkout we would see the impact in television first. Those results would be impacted later, probably not until 2009. Of course, we will pursue opportunities to reduce costs in order to mitigate any impact from a prolonged work stoppage. Studio Entertainment faces the toughest year-over-year comparisons in 2008 given the tremendous results in 2007. Key drivers in performance will include three first quarter home video releases, Pirates 3, Ratatouille, and High School Musical 2 and the four theatrical releases Bob mentioned earlier. At consumer products, we continue to invest in our merchandise licensing capabilities as we believe there are further opportunities to grow across character franchises and product categories. We\u2019ve also been pleased with our video game results from both the creative and sales standpoint and we will further ramp up our investment in this business. We incurred roughly $130 million in product development costs in 2007, and we expect to invest approximately $175 million in development spending in 2008. Our bigger game releases this year include titles based on Prince Caspian, High School Musical and Hannah Montana. We expect to increase our investment in a number of strategic growth opportunities this year, including Disney Vacation Club, Disney online, Virtual World and other digital media initiatives, and in film and television programming, both domestically and in markets outside the US. In 2008, we expect our overall capital expenditures to increase by approximately $250 to $350 million; most of the increase will be used to further develop our digital capabilities at Media Networks and Studio Entertainment, while the remainder will go toward investment in our parks and resorts, including some initial spending to expand and enhance California Adventure at the Disneyland Resort. Our primary objective is to manage and invest for growth and shareholder value and our approach to allocating capital reflects that objective. Given our significant pre-cash flow over the past several years and our expectation of continued strong cash flow, we believe that maintaining a disciplined approach to reinvesting that capital is critical to maximizing value for shareholders. Our first priority is to invest in existing businesses or new growth opportunities that can generate attractive return. We also expect that over the next 3 to 5 years we will find additional attractive acquisition opportunities that will more than likely be small to medium size. Obviously any acquisition would need to meet all of our financial and strategic criteria. Our Club Penguin acquisition last summer is an excellent example of just such an opportunity. In addition to internal investment and acquisitions, we expect to continue to return cash to shareholders by both buybacks and dividends. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased over 200 million shares of Disney stock for approximately $6.9 billion, with just over 50 million of those shares purchased in the fourth quarter. Since we began our share buyback activities about 3 years ago, we have repurchased over $17 billion of our stock, while at the same time strengthening our financial position. Bob spoke earlier about the Disney difference: we believe that this competitive advantage allows us to generate higher returns on successful branded content and that effect was evident in 2007. More importantly, we believe it positions us extremely well to deliver attractive earnings growth in the years ahead. Consider the tremendous number of important and valuable branded franchises of the Company; franchises like High School Musical, Hannah Montana, the Disney princesses, Cars, Toy Story, Lion King, Pirates of the Caribbean, Fairies, and of course, Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh. High School Musical is a particularly good example: this franchise contributed more than $100 million to operating income in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007 combined. Even with the success of High School Musical 2 around the world, we expect to see an even bigger impact from the High School Musical franchise in 2008. The growth in the combined contributions in all these franchises demonstrates the value of the Disney difference. Our key brands, most notably Disney and ESPN, and the high-quality content and experiences we create and distribute under them, provide us a base of business from which we can grow in our existing businesses, as well as through new platforms and technologies and across markets around the world. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call back to Lowell for Q&A.\nLowell Singer: Thanks Tom. Operator, please open the lines; we are happy to take the first question.\nOperator: Your first question comes from the line of Anthony Noto \u2013 Goldman Sachs.\nAnthony Noto \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Tom, first question for you. Obviously the top line results for theme parks continue to be very strong but I think the margins were down on a year-over-year basis for the first time in a number of quarters, so I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the details there. And then Bob, obviously return on investment capital remains a key focus for the management team in driving the shareholder value. By my calculation, it is up to about 9.2% in \u201907 and up about 3.9% in \u201902. I think there\u2019s a lot of skepticism that that can continue to increase. Where do you think that goes longer term? And are you compensated specifically on that number? Thank you.\nThomas O. Staggs: With regard to parks, the key thing to know is that the margin decline that you saw in the fourth quarter was driven solely off of the international parks activities. Some foreign exchange differences at Disneyland Paris but also the results at Hong Kong Disneyland. If you take a look at the domestic parks by themselves, we actually saw some margin expansion in the quarter as we will continue to try to work for going forward.\nRobert A. Iger: On the ROIC question, first of all, it has been a significant component from a [inaudible] perspective in the determination of not just my compensation but the compensation of a number of top executives of the company, and every decision that we make in terms of CapEx spending we make with an eye toward delivering returns that we consider to be acceptable. And in fact as a goal, we are determined to improve our returns on capital, which we\u2019ve been doing, as you noted, over the last number of years. In terms of where it goes, I can only tell you that our targets in terms of the decisions we\u2019ve made so far would have us delivering improved returns overall on our invested capital. Specifically on the so-called big ticket items, we made three key decisions in the last year about the theme parks, each one with an eye toward improved capital returns but each one for different reasons. We continue to invest in our vacation club business where ROIC has been strong for quite a long time, and we believe we\u2019ll be able to continue to maintain that strength. On the cruise ship side, as all of you know, we\u2019ve had double-digit returns on invested capital, our investment in the two new ships are designed to continue those strong returns, and we believe we\u2019ll be able to, or we would not have made that decision. And then lastly, in California Adventure, let\u2019s face it, we had a problem with California Adventure. It was not as successful and the returns on that investment were not as strong as we would like. As we looked at this entire Disneyland resort and we considered the most recent success, we concluded that the only way we could grow that business would be to fix and expand California Adventure, and in doing so, we intend fully to improve capital returns but we are also using a critical asset, Pixar, to help do that. Everything that we have done in the parks that\u2019s Pixar derivative has been enormously successful; the most recent, the sub ride at Disneyland. And so using Cars Land to anchor California Adventure is not only right creatively but we think it\u2019s the best thing we can do to strengthen returns on invested capital.\nAnthony Noto \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Great. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Anthony. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif with Merrill Lynch.\nJessica Reif-Cohen - Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Can you discuss the impact of the U.S. dollar? I guess of course your business, but in the theme parks, are you seeing -- I guess what are you seeing from the international visitor side and what are your expectations that the weak dollar will keep U.S. consumers closer to home and therefore in your parks? And a completely separate question; music seems to be this little hidden gem for you guys. How big is it now?\nRobert A. Iger: Tom, you can go over the numbers on the theme parks. I just want -- one comment on the currency issue and I think you touched upon exactly what we are seeing. I think people immediately conclude that because the dollar is weak, particularly against European currencies, notably the Euro and the Pound, that more Europeans will be coming to the parks. In fact, we\u2019ve had some decent growth in international visitation but not up to the point that we saw back in the early part of this decade. So in other words, it hasn\u2019t quite bounced back as far as it had been in 2000 in particular. What we are seeing though is that even though Europe had a pretty good summer in terms of American tourism, by and large our tourists, the people who are visiting the Disney parks, are probably staying closer to home, meaning taking more domestic vacations than they may have been if the dollar was stronger against European currency. That sort of upper middle class which might have gone to -- might be going to international destinations under different currency circumstances is staying more put domestically.\nThomas O. Staggs: With regard to -- just looking at the attendance trends, the international attendance has been strong. We saw it strong in the fourth quarter. In fact, it was up low double-digit percentages versus the prior year. Interestingly enough, domestic tourist attendance was also strong at Walt Disney World, and so it syncs up with what Bob was saying. So if you look at the dollar overall on our business, first of all the currency fluctuation doesn\u2019t have a dramatic effect in any one year because of our hedging program, but over time, obviously, we can see some impact in terms of the difference in our businesses and the value of what we sell internationally. But that effect thus far has been modest.\nRobert A. Iger: On your question regarding music, as you know, we don\u2019t report music out separately. It\u2019s part of the studio. Another reason it isn\u2019t reported out separately is the way we are running the music business right now is really multi-platform in approach. We create music both through our record group but also on other platforms, notably the Disney Channel. And we are using this multi-platform approach to turn a business that not long ago was losing money into a business that has become highly profitable. To put it in perspective, over $100 million in what we call operating income, and we believe it has the chance to be one of the most successful new music businesses in the music industry. What I find interesting about that is that multi-platform approach, which was definitely a strategy of ours, is the exact same thing that we intend to apply to our video business. So where in music, you have the Disney Channel and Radio Disney and the music group and the studio and other platforms. In our videogames business, we are doing the exact same thing. And so where a publishing company on the outside in the video games business, they may not have a cable channel or a movie company or even a record business, or a radio business. We have all of those -- and online is the other example -- and we intend to use them fully to do exactly what we did in the music business to our videogames business but on a much larger scale.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Jessica.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.\nMichael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein: Thanks. I have one for Bob and one for Tom. The question I have for Bob is historically, when you look back, how long in advance of people\u2019s trips to the parks do they start booking those trips? I guess the question is when will today\u2019s consumer plan their trip to go to your parks?\nRobert A. Iger: That\u2019s a good question, Michael. That window has narrowed over the years and while I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a more narrowing, it\u2019s gotten a lot narrower than it used to be. In other words, we don\u2019t -- it\u2019s sort of flattened out at this point. Visibility is more a few months in, maybe if you\u2019re lucky you get out to a second quarter as opposed to the old six month/nine month cycle. Tom talked a little bit about bookings in the first quarter being up over last year at our parks. I can tell you that bookings for the second quarter and the third quarter are up significantly. I have to say though that in the third quarter, you are not talking about that much booking because of the window issue that I talked about. So while we are up at this period, we are up now versus a similar period last year nicely in the third quarter, it\u2019s still pretty early. The second quarter is interesting because we are looking at substantial improvement and we find that\u2019s interesting because of what\u2019s going on in the economy and we might not be, by the way, as leading edge as we used to be in terms of -- or at it being an indicator. We might be more lagging than that, but so far we are not seeing an impact on everything that\u2019s going on in the economy. Gas price is an interesting one. I talked to the head of our international, our global parks today. We have a big, for instance, a big RV park at Orlando and I would think that they would be hit the hardest because it is pretty expensive to fill up a tank in one of those babies. And those parks have been completely full, and there\u2019s demand on the RV parks going forward from a bookings perspective. So it appears that even though there are definite issues in the economy, people are not giving up their family vacations, particularly to Disney destinations.\nMichael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein: Thanks, and then I have one for Tom, which is there\u2019s been a lot of chatter about the make good status of broadcast TV, whether or not all make goods from the previous season have been completed, so can you talk a bit about where ABC stands on make goods from last year? And are you delivering the audiences this season that you expected from the start of the year?\nThomas O. Staggs: Yeah, we had some make good carryover from last year, so our Q4 -- calendar Q3 to this calendar Q4, our fiscal Q1. But as we look at it now, we feel very good about where we are in terms of the stewardship situation. I don\u2019t expect to be in a difficult make good situation come the end of the quarter at this point. And in terms of audience delivery, all the networks save one are down a little bit year over year but not dramatically so, and it\u2019s within the stewardship levels that we anticipated going into the up-front. So I would say that we are in reasonably good shape and certainly by being in good shape, we have the opportunity to take advantage of what is an extremely strong advertising market right now.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Michael. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Spencer Wang of Bear Stearns. Please go ahead.\nSpencer Wang - Bear Stearns: Thanks. Just two quick question, the first is for Tom; your balance sheet, your leverage ratio is well under two times now. Outside of reinvesting the core businesses, would you consider accelerating the share buy-back? And then the second question is can you just tell us what your expectations are for your pension and post-retirement medical cost assumptions for fiscal \u201908? Thanks.\nThomas O. Staggs: Sure. With regard to the balance sheet, we\u2019ve said in the past that we were targeting that single A minus, single A sort of rating level. I guess we\u2019re at the strong end of that. I am not overly concerned about it having gotten too strong. But at the same time, we are also not looking to dramatically decrease our leverage from here. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, you should expect the share repurchase to continue despite the fact that we think there are opportunities to invest for growth in our existing and new lines of business. So I guess that\u2019s my way of saying don\u2019t look for a dramatic acceleration of the share buy-back program, but I think you can expect us to continue to buy back shares, given our expectations of strong cash flow going forward. And then with regard to pension and post retirement medical, the change in that will not be a big driver in 2008. There will be a very modest reduction, I expect, in the expense of that due to a change in interest rates but again, not a big driver at all.\nSpencer Wang - Bear Stearns: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Spencer. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. The next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nDoug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank: Thanks. Good afternoon. If I look across your branded properties, it seems to be the most under-monetized are the Pixar brands. I mean, everyone on this call knows Toy Story and Finding Nemo, Incredibles, Cars, now Ratatouille has been so successful internationally. But at one Pixar film per year, it seems Disney\u2019s not in a position to fully monetize these properties. Bob, I know you are intensely focused on brand monetization, so do you agree with that statement and when might we see a solution to that problem?\nRobert A. Iger: I agree with you that there is definitely value both to the Pixar brand overall. When that name\u2019s on a movie or a DVD as a for instance I think it has real value to consumers, but also specifically to those franchises. We are working hard at mining those franchises, both on the big screen and in other ways. Toy Story is clearly an obvious one as it relates to the big screen and we are in production on Toy Story 3, that we feel really good about. We know the story already and are looking forward to that release a few years from now, 2010. Cars has turned out to be a tremendous franchise for us. Interesting, over 85 million of those die cast cars have been sold to date. You can add another 4 million or 5 million above that when you add what\u2019s been sold at our various Disney properties, and you get an incredible number. It\u2019s one of the strongest toy franchises out there and in fact, the numbers went up in 2007 versus \u201906, which is the year that it was release and we have high hopes for that in \u201908 and beyond. And so we are developing online a virtual world for Cars that we are quite excited about, and I don\u2019t have anything further to say about other big screen development at Pixar beyond what we\u2019ve announced, but it would clearly be considered a candidate for a sequel. In terms of the others, there\u2019s definitely opportunities but again, we are not just looking at big screen possibilities and sequels. We are looking at new means. Our very recent experience with Club Penguin suggests that you can engage people, notably kids, by immersing them in these online worlds pretty deeply and heavily and keep franchises alive in ways that are I think quite attractive long-term for the company. So when we think Pixar, we definitely agree that there\u2019s more to be mined but we are not going to mine the value in one way. It will be multiple ways.\nDoug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Doug. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. The next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente of Lehman Brothers. Please proceed.\nAnthony DiClemente - Lehman Brothers: Thank you. A question for Bob; Bob, relative to the other broadcast networks, it\u2019s clear that ABC\u2019s content is available on the fewest number of distribution channels and it might seem like the presence of Steve Jobs on your board may have an impact on your strategy on digital TV distribution, both on the pay-per-download side, where iTunes is your primary distributor, and on the free TV side, where it\u2019s more of a closed architecture. My question is would you agree with that assessment? What do you see as the key benefits of that closed architecture approach and do you think that the limited number of distribution channels for ABC is actually driving incrementally stronger demands for your TV content? Thanks.\nRobert A. Iger: Well, we just did a deal recently with AOL which is a pretty significant platform in terms of distributing our product, and we are going to continue to take an expansive point of view in terms of where we distribute the product, meaning there will be more places than just iTunes, abc.com and AOL. But we have pretty high standards in terms of the platforms that we put them on. What we found in a lot of the deals that had been made, when you take a look at the platform, whether it\u2019s the positioning of your content or the quality of the user interface, we think it\u2019s unlikely that value is going to be created there, and so what we are looking to do is actually create value with a high quality user interface, so that more consumers consume the shows. And also an environment that we feel is simply right for the programming that we create and not lumped in with the massive product that\u2019s put on the Internet, branded and unbranded, high quality, low quality, in some cases no quality. And again, we\u2019ve had an interesting debate because we\u2019ve massed a lot of our content online on abc.com with an eye toward essentially mining a little bit of brand value out of that platform and also using it to upsell the market other things that ABC is doing. It\u2019s also become a pretty good platform for advertisers that we can integrate well within our overall network sales effort. But I think long term, if we are going to drive greater circulation for those shows, we\u2019ll have to put them on more platforms. But we don\u2019t believe we need to put them on any platforms.\nAnthony DiClemente - Lehman Brothers: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Anthony. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Imran Khan of J.P. Morgan.\nImran Khan - J.P. Morgan: Thank you for taking my question. Two questions; number one, Tom, can you give us some swing factor to understand how should we think about the media networks cost structure growth next year? Secondly, studio had a great year. As you said, your Disney branded strategy is working. How should we think about normalized margins for studio over the three years or so? Thank you.\nThomas O. Staggs: Swing factors at media networks, as you I think are pointing out, beyond the revenue side that I discussed earlier, of course, it\u2019s the programming costs that are the primary swing factors. I would expect that if you look at the network, you will see some increase in the average cost per primetime entertainment hour, that you would expect that because we have a number of returning hit shows. But where it really comes out will depend of course on the number of new shows that are successful, how long they run, et cetera and what would be put in place of any shows that don\u2019t make it. The programming costs also would be impacted potentially to the extent that the writers\u2019 strike went for a long period of time, and there again we would look to respond in part by mitigating costs. If you go beyond that, you\u2019ve got the first complete year of NASCAR coverage at ESPN, which will of course impact their programming costs, and that\u2019s the biggest driver there. And then I alluded to it earlier, we are continuing to invest in original programming at the Disney Channel. We are doing that domestically and internationally. We are investing in programming at ABC Family as we continue to see good results there, but I would point out that ABC Family this year does not have Major League Baseball expensed against it where it did last year. So on the whole, I think you will see a net greater investment in film and television. We think that investment overall is going to help driver longer term growth. And per the conversations we\u2019ve had today and earlier, there\u2019s a lot of focus on doing that under our key brands where we think we earn the strongest returns and have the best opportunity to leverage that programming across multiple platforms. With regard to the studio and the studio margin, the studio [has had] a great year this year. I believe that they are positioned to deliver more consistent strong margins, like the strong margins they had this year, by virtue of the fact that their focused on the Disney brand, et cetera. Margins in any given year could be impacted by the degree and the level to which we have hits. That\u2019s the nature of the business. It\u2019s somewhat hit-driven. The good news is that as businesses like music, as Bob discussed early, stage play, et cetera, grow within the studio, I think you could see more predictability and more stability to those margins. While we don\u2019t target or disclose publicly a specific margin for the studio business, I think you will see consistently higher margins out of the studio in the coming years as opposed to if you look back at the last five.\nImran Khan - J.P. Morgan: Thank you. That\u2019s helpful.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Heath Terry of Credit Suisse.\nHeath Terry - Credit Suisse: Thank you. You mentioned the strength in international travel to the theme parks that you are seeing due to the weak dollar. Can you give us an idea of what kind of mix you are seeing now and how that compares with what you\u2019ve seen in the past?\nThomas O. Staggs: If you look at the international attendance, that had been up around a little over 20% of the total attendance. It dropped down to something close to the mid-teens at the low point after 2001. Now it is closer to around 18% or so, so in terms of mix, it\u2019s not quite back to where it was before and we think there might be room to continue to push that up, but it has recovered nicely in terms of percentages form where it had been just after 9/11.\nRobert A. Iger: The other thing to note when we talk about international tourism, it\u2019s not just about the currency. Traveling to the United States isn\u2019t as easy as we believe it could or should be. In some markets, not EU markets, but in some there are huge visa complications, and in others there are infrastructure issues -- quality of airports, difficulty from a security perspective, some of that, of course, we understand and tolerate but it\u2019s clear from some of the work that we\u2019ve done, particularly in Europe, that Europeans view traveling to the United States as much more difficult than it used to be, and that I think has had an impact.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Heath. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jonathan Jacoby of Banc of America Securities. Please proceed.\nJonathan Jacoby - Banc of America Securities: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just following up on the park visibility, and not to harp on this but when you look out two quarters, how much different in terms of -- because you keep saying the tightness. I\u2019m just curious how much less visibility you have. And then in terms of advertising, are you seeing -- national is clearly strong, you spoke about the strong scatter markets in both cable and broadcast. But I\u2019m wondering at your local TV stations, if you are seeing any different trends. Thanks.\nRobert A. Iger: On the parks visibility question, it narrowed a couple of years ago -- actually, probably more than a couple, just post 9/11. And it hasn\u2019t narrowed more since then, so we really -- we look at it. We have bookings a few quarters out but the significant bookings just in terms of volume are more like one quarter out. You are talking basically three to four months. So when we talk about growth and bookings for our fiscal second quarter, we feel pretty good that the early indications suggest that it should be a decent quarter there. And we\u2019ll talk about the third quarter, even though we are up nicely, we\u2019re talking about relatively few rooms on the books at this point. On the advertising front --\nThomas O. Staggs: Local TV stations are -- if you take a look at the fourth quarter, local TV stations ad revenues were down about 4%. Now, that\u2019s more than explained by a difference in political advertising across our local TV stations, and so that number might look a little worse than perhaps the underlying market is from an overall demand standpoint. We are seeing a similar phenomenon in the first quarter, pacings that right now are down in the neighborhood of 7%. Again, if you look at political advertising this year, and [this quarter] specifically, that handily explains that decline. I think political advertising for the year as a whole for us will be off modestly but it will be down in the first quarter and up slightly in the ensuring three quarters. That\u2019s what I think -- it\u2019s hard to read underneath but I think that\u2019s what is really driving that --\nRobert A. Iger: Let\u2019s also remember we\u2019re not talking about that much in terms of volume. We only have 10 TV stations. Our exposure as a company to advertising is roughly 23% of our revenue \u201907 came from advertising, so relatively modest compared with some of our peers in terms of percentage of total revenue.\nJonathan Jacoby - Banc of America Securities: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Jonathan. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. The next question comes from the line of Michael Morris with UBS.\nMichael Morris - UBS: Thank you. A couple of questions on the international sale of television programming, which you noted as a contributor in the third quarter. You didn\u2019t mention this quarter. I\u2019m wondering, is that something that we should consider just seasonal and a third quarter contributor, or do you see opportunity to have that smoothed out a bit more during the year? I\u2019m trying to get a feel for the growth potential of that incrementally to what you are currently doing. And then also, do you see opportunities to produce content, television content in local markets, similar to the way you mentioned films? Or is the best way to approach that by basically repurposing the domestically produced content? Thanks.\nThomas O. Staggs: With regard to international syndication sales, looking at that quarter to quarter is a little dangerous because the timing of the sales and the timing of the availability of the programming will impact the booking of the revenues from that. So for example, in this most recent quarter, in 2006 we had strong syndication sales, mostly domestic, from shows like According to Jim. This year we had less availability, and so you saw less revenue in that quarter. We continue to see real strength in international syndication. We see real demand for the kinds of shows that we\u2019ve been making and the strength of shows like Desperate Housewives, Grey\u2019s, Lost, makes us think that that will continue to be an important driver, even though on a quarter to quarter basis, it might look a little bit lumpy. If you look at it over time, they should be pretty strong, steady contributors, assuming we continue to refill that pipeline.\nRobert A. Iger: On the question of investing in local production as we\u2019ve done already on movies, we intend to do that in television as well. A lot of it will be done under the Disney brand and we have a number of instances where we are creating original television content for markets, although what we are finding is a lot of that has application back in the United States and in other markets. We are also going it somewhat at ABC. There\u2019s been some what we are calling reversioning, so we are actually shooting original episodes of Desperate Housewives in Latin American countries, as a for instance, with local actors in local languages, both southern Latin America, Argentina, northern Latin America in Mexico and also in Portuguese and Brazil.\nMichael Morris - UBS: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Mike. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. The next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet of Citigroup.\nJason Bazinet - Citigroup: Thanks so much. I guess if I rolled the clock back three or four years, I was [listening appropriately]. It seemed like a lot of the cable operators were begging for the media companies to help them put, to differentiate their product by putting a lot of your TV and theatrical product on VOD. And now we\u2019ve sort of moved forward to this bizarre world where everyone has those DVRs on their TV and you\u2019ve got this new ratings system and -- I guess my question as you step back and look where the industry is now, would you put the odds at low or medium or high that the floodgates open up and we rethink the way content is distributed to make VOD much more user friendly to sort of restore that affiliate balance the cable networks historically had?\nRobert A. Iger: I think there is an opportunity to grow consumption, this programming, in many different ways. I think the answer I would give would be it is not going to come just from one direction. It is going to come from multiple directions, and VOD is going to be a contributor to that. We are entering that world, walking before we run, in many cases, with both ABC and Disney branded programming, advertiser supported and on a pay-per-view basis -- movies included, by the way. And I think that as systems improve from a user-friendlier, navigation perspective, consumption is likely to improve. But consumers -- one thing that we are learning more and more from the research that we\u2019ve done with consumers is they want customization. They don\u2019t want -- it\u2019s no longer one size fits all. They don\u2019t want a product just one way. They want it their way and their way is different from consumer to consumer, and that\u2019s why we have taken a pretty open, and I think fairly modern point of view on this, because we are trying in multiple businesses to keep the consumer in mind, particularly younger consumers. And that\u2019s going to affect how people watch programming. It will not be as linear as it used to be, and if it\u2019s not going to be, we still believe as a business investing in high quality branded programming, but we are going to have to offer it in a much more varied way than we did in the past.\nLowell Singer: Okay, thanks, Jason. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. The next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi of Standard & Poor\u2019s Equities.\nTuna Amobi - Standard & Poor\u2019s: Thank you very much. Bob, there\u2019s been some suggestion that with regard to the writers strike, given ABC\u2019s strong mix of returning as well as new shows that ABC could actually be among the most vulnerable should this strike go on. And that some of these shows that you have now could be affected as early as December or January. So in that context, can you perhaps update us on any contingency plans that you have to mitigate the risk of this strike beyond the cost reduction that Tom had spoken about? And a question for Tom; on High School Musical, you\u2019ve spoken about $200 million in operating income for the last two fiscal years. So looking ahead, how should we think about that franchise in terms of how that franchise could grow, given the theatrical release that you have coming up in late 2008, I believe? How do you account for the incremental contributions from High School Musical across the various segments? I believe it flows into studio and consumer and network. Can you give some sense of how -- where the bulk of the incremental revenues or contributions from that franchise are going to flow through your financials? Thank you.\nRobert A. Iger: We don\u2019t know how long this strike is going to last, so I can answer your question but a lot of it is contingent upon again length. If the writers stay out for a four week plus period of time, it will definitely have an impact on ABC\u2019s schedule, because scripted shows, even though we have a number of shows that are currently on the schedule in the can, ultimately we are going to run out of those. We are fine through the November sweeps. We\u2019ll probably end up -- we believe the strike could go longer, running a little bit more reruns in December or holiday programming than we may have and save some of the original programs for after the first of the year. We also have a lot of scripted and reality shows in the can led by Lost, which has been in production and we weren\u2019t intending to bring back until after the first of the year anyway, but we have a number of other ones and we have added to our program lineup some reality shows. And we also have a number of movie titles that we could turn to and news that we can also run. We actually think that the network is well-prepared. Of course, our preference would be to keep the schedule intact, given the momentum that we have and given the success that we\u2019ve had. We would hope that we\u2019ll be able to find a way to settle this difference and settle the strike before there\u2019s indelible damage done to the business or, by the way, to the community that we operate in. This is a trickle-down effect that this has on more than just people directly associated with producing these shows. Southern California is going to feel it first and hard and I think that\u2019s just a shame. But we are definitely going to implement contingency plans from a programming perspective if the strike persists.\nThomas O. Staggs: With regard to High School Musical, as I mentioned earlier, we do expect to see 2008 to exceed what we saw in 2006 and 2007, so the growth in that franchise continues. But just to give you a little more color on that, I would say that the primary drivers of the growth, our expectation is that it would be merchandise licensing, home video, and I also think that you\u2019ll see a little bit more on the videogame, so it shows up in a number of different places. The home video contribution, by the way, shows at both the media networks and at the studio, because some of the profits are at the studio and some of the profits are at media networks, since the studio does the distribution. Those are the primary drivers of the growth and where you\u2019ll see the incremental impact.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Tuna. Operator, we\u2019ll have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of David Miller of F&H Capital. Please proceed.\nDavid Miller - F&H Capital: Good afternoon. Bob and Tom, if I could just get your opinion -- both of your perspectives on this question. Obviously you are familiar with what is going on with the Big Ten network and the current imbroglio with Time Warner Cable and some of the other cable MSOs. If the Big Ten network is successful in getting on to the analog tier, which I don\u2019t know how they are going to do it, since there is no room, but that\u2019s what they want and if they are successful in doing that, what does that do, if anything, to your ratings guarantees as it applies to the big ten football package that you have on ESPN? And would there theoretically be some siphoning off of viewership there over to the Big Ten network, or some of those football games, especially in the upper Midwest states? Thank you very much.\nRobert A. Iger: ESPN is incredibly strong, both from a brand perspective and a programming perspective, and the deal it has with the big ten, which is long term in nature, affords them the right to cover primary games on their networks. So I really don\u2019t think that there will be an impact if the Big Ten network gets more carriage. I have to admit, I haven\u2019t asked specifically of the ESPN sales guys or the research people, but George Bodenheimer and I talk a lot about the impact of these -- what I\u2019ll call sports organization owned channels, and we spent a fair amount of time focused on just maintaining ESPN\u2019s strength, both from a primary platform and a multi-platform, strengthening our marketing efforts, as well as our creative efforts. They\u2019ve made a number of steps in terms of the production quality that is aimed at being even more competitive than they\u2019ve been. So reach more people more often with higher quality programming, better marketing -- I actually thing they\u2019ll be fine. I think it\u2019s also important to point out that these leagues or sports organizations are paid significantly by not just ESPN but other networks carrying sports, and that essentially eliminates the risk from these organizations in terms of having to distribute their product and having to sell their product and having to produce their product. We are essentially paying them guarantees, so the risk is completely taken out of the equation. I don\u2019t think you are going to see a time anytime soon that these sports-owned channels eclipse the non-sports-owned channels, meaning the non-organization-owned channels, nor do I think you are going to see a time any time soon where there\u2019s going to be a substantial impact on ratings. Now, from time to time, there will be programming on that is more competitive. I note with great interest that the NFL Channel has a good game coming up, I\u2019m a Green Bay Packer fan. I think they are playing the Dallas Cowboys. That\u2019s a good game, I\u2019m sure they will have an impact but it\u2019s not airing against ESPN NFL Football night, fortunately.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Dave. Thanks again, everyone, for joining us today. I want to note that a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that were referred to on this call to equivalent GAAP measures can be found on our investor relations website.

Thank you very much for your patience and welcome to the third quarter 2007 Walt Disney earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2007 call. Joining me today in Burbank are Bob Iger, Disney's President and CEO; and Tom Staggs, SEVP and CFO.  Two press releases are now available on our website, our Q3 earnings release and a release announcing our acquisition of Club Penguin. This call will be webcast from our investor relations website. After the call, we will post a replay and a written transcript of today's remarks.  Bob is going to lead off, followed by Tom. We will then open it up to Q&A and then I will return for some important Safe Harbor comments. With that said, let me turn it over to Bob. \nBob Iger: Thanks, Lowell. Look forward to those important comments. Good afternoon, everyone. After a terrific 2006 performance and excellent first quarter results, I'm pleased to report we have had another solid quarter, posting double-digit increases in segment operating income and earnings per share from continuing operations. We have again achieved a strong record by focusing on doing what we do best: that's building high quality, creative franchises across multiple platforms and multiple markets. A consistent strategic vision, a skillful, well-coordinated management team and a commitment to financial discipline are the key elements of our success, while creativity and innovation remain at the heart of everything we do.  Today we announced that Disney has acquired Club Penguin, as Lowell mentioned. This is one of the fastest-growing online virtual worlds for kids. We believe that Club Penguin embodies values of the utmost importance to Disney: that is providing high-quality family entertainment and fostering parental trust. This is thoroughly consistent with our strategic vision. Club Penguin is a great example of creativity and technology merging, resulting in an engaging, entertaining and immersive environment for its users. Just as with our Disney.com, kids love Club Penguin and parents trust it.  In less than two years, Club Penguin has grown into a site that boasts more than 12 million activated users and 700,000 paying subscribers. Imagine how Disney's marketing skills and worldwide technological capabilities can contribute to Club Penguin's growth, and you can see why we are so enthusiastic about this acquisition. We are pleased that Club Penguin founders Lane Merrifield, Dave Krysko and Lance Priebe are joining Disney. They have done a fantastic job of building their business in a short period of time with great creativity and innovation, and we look forward to working with them.  Disney's technological know-how, online capabilities and international reach will support global expansion of the Club Penguin franchise. We plan to rename it Disney's Club Penguin and to immediately use our Disney branded properties such as Disney.com, Disney Channel, Radio Disney and our parks and resorts to raise its profiles. For those of you who are on your computers, you can log on to Disney.com and see what I mean.  Earlier this year at the consumer electronics show we announced we were embarking on the creation of a number of virtual online worlds through our new Disney.com web site where kids and families can have compelling, immersive experiences. Our vision has been to create online destinations where kids around the world can interact with each other and play games along side their favorite Disney characters. Combining the creativity and knowledge of the Club Penguin team with our existing Disney online assets, including the number one web site for kids and families, Disney.com, will help us to further our objective of establishing clear global leadership and the development of virtual online worlds for families and kids.  We believe virtual worlds can extend and expand on the life of a franchise, expand our global reach for our entertainment content, and allow us direct contact with our consumers in a more personalized and engaging way. All aspects of our strategy hinge on our ability to create compelling content, and I'm happy to say that Disney remains on a creative roll.  In the midst of perhaps the most competitive summer ever for movies with one blockbuster opening after another, we are pleased with the performance of our third quarter releases, Pirates of the Caribbean, at World\u2019s End and Ratatouille. Pirates is the number one movie of the year globally, with worldwide box office revenues to-date of over $950 million, making it the fifth-highest grossing movie of all time. Ratatouille, the best-reviewed movie of the year, is on track to see over $200 million in domestic box office, and is just now beginning its broad international rollout. We expect Pirates and Ratatouille to do well during the holiday season when they are released on DVD, iTunes and soon after on Video-on-Demand.  At our cable networks, Disney Channel remains a creative powerhouse that continues to maintain its leadership with 6 to 14-year-olds while capturing its largest ever share of the preschool audience. We expect this position to be reinforced later this month when High School Musical 2 premieres, raising to a whole new level an entertainment phenomenon that's come to define the virtues of our multi-platform, multi-market approach.  So far, High School Musical has been seen by over 160 million viewers worldwide. Global soundtrack sales now top 7 million, while 7.8 million DVDs and 4.5 million books have been purchased by consumers, and some 2,000 licensed products are underway in schools and community theaters. High School Musical 2 is also a launching pad for a back-to-school merchandising campaign, and our biggest ever sales program with Wal-Mart stores.  The creative strength of our studio and networks is bolstering the performance of our businesses in many different ways. Miley Cyrus, the star of Disney Channel\u2019s Hannah Montana is the youngest artist ever to have two Billboard number one records in one year, both of course, on Walt Disney Records.  The newly christened Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage at Disneyland is drawing huge crowds and highlights again the strength and value of Pixar\u2019s creativity, especially in combination with Walt Disney Imagineering.  We are also very excited about the ABC Network fall season where a strong slate of new shows will join hits like Grey\u2019s Anatomy, Dancing With the Stars, Ugly Betty and Desperate Housewives. ABC\u2019s performance during the recent upfront reinforces the value of our broadcast networks as an effective platform for advertisers to reach a mass audience with attractive demographics. We achieved high single-digit CPM increases at the network and booked over $2.4 billion in total primetime commitments.  Once again, ESPN had a great quarter, leading results at our cable networks. ESPN is an exceptionally well-positioned brand that crosses multiple media platforms and is expanding both its business lines and its international presence. Looking ahead, we believe ESPN will continue to be an important driver of growth for Disney in the years to come.  A commitment to great, high quality creative work, a persistent focus on new technologies and intelligence investment in international markets are the strategies we believe can continue to carry us forward. We have a strong balance sheet, incredible assets and a disciplined approach to new investment, favoring those areas that enhance our key brands and provide the best return on capital.  We believe our business model is proving flexible enough to adapt to fast-changing markets and consumer preferences, all the while enhancing long-term shareholder value.  With that, I will turn it over to Tom Staggs. \nTom Staggs: Thank you, Bob. Good afternoon, everyone. We are now three-quarters of the way through our 2007 fiscal year and I am happy to note that we are well on our way to delivering yet another year of double-digit earnings growth. At Media Networks, the strong results we have seen all year continued in the third quarter. Broadcasting revenues were up due to international sales of Lost, desperate Housewives and Ugly Betty, along with higher domestic syndication and home video sales. The network also reported higher advertising revenue for the quarter.  Fewer pilots and lower production expense at ABC Studios helped push broadcast operating income to more than double the prior year quarter. These gains were partially offset by increased spending on our digital initiatives including Disney Mobile. ABC's softer ratings in the quarter were more than made up for by strong advertising sales and CPMs in Q3 were up double-digit percentages versus last year's upfront.  At cable networks, ESPN delivered higher affiliate revenue, even though we recognized $57 million less in deferred revenues this quarter than we did in Q3 of last year. In the fourth quarter we expect to recognize all of the ESPN's remained deferred affiliate revenues for the year, which amounts to a little over $185 million more in deferred revenue recognition than we recorded in last year's Q4.  Advertising revenues for ESPN came in on par with the prior year quarter, despite difficult programming comparisons including fewer Major League Baseball games and lower ratings of the NBA playoffs.  Looking ahead, we are extremely excited to have NASCAR back on our networks this year and last Sunday's All State 400 at the Brickyard performed well on ESPN, delivering a 4.9 rating among total cable households. Given the timing of our races, we will book roughly 60% of our NASCAR rights cost for first season in this fiscal year, with a great majority of those costs coming in Q4. Disney ABC Cable Networks also contributed to this quarter\u2019s growth, through increases in both advertising and affiliate revenue, especially at ABC Family.  At Parks and Resorts we delivered solid revenue and income growth, as well as improved margins. Our parks and resorts have a unique advantage in terms of their scale and their ability to leverage our stories and characters to create an immersive experience for our guests. We continue to capitalize on those strengths through marketing, pricing and guest service campaigns, such as Year of a Million Dreams, Magic Your Way and Disney's Magical Express to drive increases in guest spending and hotel occupancy.  Walt Disney world attendance increased by 4%, growth primarily led by increases from domestic visitors. Per capita spending came in slightly higher than last year. Our Florida hotels also performed well, with occupancy just above last year at 93% and per room spending up 5%.  Disneyland Resort comparisons are challenging this year, given the successful 50th Anniversary celebration last year. Despite this tough comp, attendance was roughly the same as in Q3 of last year, while guest spending was up by low single-digits at the Disneyland Resort. Our West Coast hotels\u2019 performance was very strong as well. Occupancies came in at 96%, which is in line with last year and per room spending increased by 9%. Looking ahead to Q4, combined domestic attendance trends so far are roughly flat with the prior year but room reservations for the quarter are currently pacing low double-digit percentages ahead of last year\u2019s Q4.  At Disneyland Paris, Q3 attendance increased 9%. The trends there continue to be strong. With regard to Hong Kong Disneyland, we have discussed that attendance to date has fallen short of what we would like and that we expect to invest further in Hong Kong Disneyland\u2019s marketing and attractions to help ensure its long-term success.  The Studios creative success over the past couple of years has been spectacular, and that success is evidenced in year-to-date results for this segment. In Q3, our box office success continued, driven by the strong worldwide performance of Pirates of the Caribbean, at World\u2019s End and the opening of Ratatouille. The difference this quarter, however, was in home video, where last year\u2019s release of the Chronicles of Narnia sold over 18 million units with no comparable release in this year's Q3.  The segment's operating performance was also affected by the timing of the marketing spend for Ratatouille, which premiered domestically at the very end of the quarter. As Bob mentioned, Ratatouille has been well received and we will continue to roll out the movie in additional markets around the world throughout the summer and fall.  With that said, it's worth noting that in Q4, the studio will face comparisons of the worldwide theatrical release of Pirates of the Caribbean 2, which went on to become the third most successful film in box office history.  Consumer products continued to perform very well this last quarter. Consumer products revenue growth of 23% outpaced operating income, primarily due to the fact that the large portion of the revenue growth was driven by our self-published video games, led by Pirates 3. We are encouraged by the success thus far in this business, but as we continue to ramp up our investment in video games, these efforts will continue to dampen margins for Consumer Products in the near term. In addition, the absence of US Weekly which we sold at the beginning of year dampened year-over-year margin comparisons for the quarter by roughly 1.5 percentage points.  In licensing, Cars products continue to perform extremely well, further solidifying our belief in the long-term strength and value of this new franchise.  As we have said in the past, our first priority for incremental capital investment is strategically attractive opportunities for growth that we believe can generate strong returns for our shareholders. The Club Penguin acquisition we just announced is completely consistent with this approach. From its launch in October of 2005 through the end of calendar 2006, Club Penguin grew paid subs to 400,000. Since the beginning of calendar 2007, Club Penguin has increased this figure by more than 300,000 and paid subs now stand at more than 700,000. We believe that figure can continue to grow.  We are making an upfront payment of approximately $350 million for Club Penguin, with a potential for additional purchase price payments of as much as $350 million through the end of calendar 2009, depending on the growth of Club Penguin\u2019s earnings. Although there is obviously the potential for significant future payments, the deal is structured such that the value creation opportunity from this acquisition is greater as the payments increase. We expect the deal to be accretive to our earnings in year one and more accretive if we achieve the higher earnings levels that would result in increased payments under the earn out.  Our strong balance sheet and free cash flow provide us with the financial flexibility to capitalize on acquisitions like Club Penguin and other investment opportunities as they arise. At the same time, we continue to return capital to our investors through both dividends and share repurchase. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 55 million Disney shares for approximately $1.9 billion. Taking into account the shares we purchased since the end of the quarter, we have bought a total of nearly 180 million shares this fiscal year at a cost of just under $6.2 billion.  We are pleased with the trends we are seeing across the company as each of our businesses is executing well against our strategic priorities. These priorities include our commitment to developing quality content that strengthens consumers relationships with our brands, and our ability to leverage creative success across the scope of our businesses. The result has been the strong earnings growth, cash flow and improving capital returns we have been achieving. At the same time, we have nurtured and extended the competitive advantages that can help us deliver increasing value for our shareholders in the future.  With that, I will turn the call back over to Lowell for Q&A. \nLowell Singer: Operator, we are ready to begin the question-and-answer portion. \n Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much. Two questions, the first is on ESPN, Tom, did you recognize less of the revenue deferral in the quarter than you anticipated? And if so, could you quantify how much? We thought it would be about $150 million. It looks like the fourth quarter is going to be almost $200 million more than we thought.  A second question, Bob, on Club Penguin, if I do the quick math based on the price point available on the site and what I'm currently paying, it looks like their revenue run rate is about $50 million. Does your assumption for accretion assume that just the current business drives the economics? Or does it also assume some additional opportunity of building the Club Penguin brand in different media venues such as shows on Disney Channel or other media properties outside of online? Thanks. \nBob Iger: With regard to the ESPN revenue deferral, the structure of the agreements are such that the programming commitments are met around this time of year. There's a decent amount of swing in what amount of revenues we would recognize in the third quarter.  If I was handicapping it as we went into the quarter, I would say that I would lean towards it being slightly more recognition than we saw, but we also knew that there was a potential for that swing. \nTom Staggs: To the second part of your question, Anthony, as a standalone business given where it is today, Club Penguin would be modestly accretive in year one for the company. When we ran the economics on a long-term basis, we are basing most of them on our ability to grow that business unto itself; meaning growing subscribers for Club Penguin, not just in the United States, but globally. We will see opportunities to exploit Club Penguin on other properties. Most of what we do there will be to market Club Penguin and to grow the core business, but there may be some other additional revenue-generating opportunities beyond just the ability to market. So video games might be a prime example, some other forms of consumer products, possibly some presence in it our theme parks and clearly some opportunities on our media networks.  But when we look at the economics again from a standalone perspective, it's accretive in year one and most of what we will be focused on will be growing their core business. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from Imran Khan - JP Morgan. \n Imran Khan - JP Morgan: I think if you look at your growth in the park business, it was quite a bit driven by the average spending per capita. I was trying to understand what kind of opportunities do you see to grow it forward from here?  Secondly, in the calendar fourth quarter or your fiscal first quarter, can you give us some sense when we should expect to see the three-disc DVD for Pirates and give us some color on that? Thank you. \nTom Staggs: With regard to parks per capita spending, we said in the past that our expectation is that the parks pricing will generally track inflation and generally we look at the leisure index to get a sense of what inflation is in that business, and we have tracked that pretty close in the past. I think it will probably be a reasonable thing to look at in the future.  So this last quarter, as an example, we saw roughly the same percentage increase from admissions per capita as we did from food and beverage, so we are seeing the strength not just in admissions but also what people are doing inside our parks. So we are pleased with that as we broaden the activities for people, we hope to capture a share portion of their vacation wallet. That's part of the strategy that Jay and his team are pushing for. \nBob Iger: The second part of your question, Imran, the Pirates 3 DVD will be available as a Christmas or holiday title. We have not announced a date for when a three movie Pirates DVD package will be on the market place, but clearly it is something we intend to do and I think you can expect to see it as a Blu-ray disk as well, but no date specific. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Jessica Reif-Cohen - Merrill Lynch. \n Jessica Reif-Cohen - Merrill Lynch: Thanks. This is an amazing acquisition. I just wonder how will the management of Club Penguin be integrated in Disney's Internet operations? Is this something that you would see Pixar management involvement in Disney Animation?  Completely separate on the upfront, can you comment on how the cable networks did and also in broadcasting, the other non-primetime day parts? \nBob Iger: Thank you for your compliments on the Club Penguin acquisition. The Club Penguin team will report directly to Steve Wadsworth who is with us today and the Internet group. Their focus, certainly in the near term, is going to be on growing their business, not just domestically but on a global basis. It is aided considerably by Disney's infrastructure, both in that space and in other businesses.  We believe that bringing them on board will give us additional expertise creatively, technologically and just in terms of their experience to date, as we seek to grow our virtual worlds online more aggressively, which as you know we have been up to.  So this is a great addition to the team. While it's not thoroughly analogous or completely analogous to the Pixar situation, I guess there are elements to it that are similar in that we are bringing expertise into a company in a space that we value greatly that we believe will provide the company with great growth. That clearly is a significant part of the value that we're buying in buying Club Penguin.  They will continue to be located in British Columbia. We hope that they will spend more time down here at Disney for the reasons I just cited, but the business will remain where it is and as I said, reporting into Steve Wadsworth.  On the upfront side, we had a strong upfront in multiple day parts at the network. Double digit CPM increases in morning news and in daytime, for instance and so in general, it was a solid upfront for ABC. On the cable network side, we have not been too specific, but both ESPN and ABC family had excellent upfronts. ABC family was up double-digit from a CPM standpoint and ESPN also had a very strong upfront, particularly against certain properties like Monday Night Football and NASCAR. \nTom Staggs: And ABC Family and Soap Net also had strong upfronts. It was pretty much strong across the board. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein. \n Michael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein: Tom, looking at your parks reconciliation that you always post, it looks like the royalty fee this quarter was very low, like $6 million. Why was that and when does the park royalty rate step up? What is going on in that? Then I have one for Bob. \nTom Staggs: Well, the answer to the first question is that the royalty rate, as you do a quarter-over-quarter comparison, as you may recall when we did the last year of Disney restructuring, we provided for the deferral of royalties at Euro Disney, and because we do have the revenue deferral, they are pushed out to a later time. They are essentially turned into a debt obligation so we don't recognize the deferral through the income statement until it's appropriate to do so. So that's the primary difference between those two figures. \n Michael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein: The second is for you, Bob. When you look at all of your divisions, they are all operating well. The question I have is when you look at your portfolio of assets, which divisions or assets do you think have the best ability to raise margins in the company in a couple of years? Where do you think you have the best chance to lift margins? Which division? \nBob Iger: Well, we are working hard at margin growth, obviously in all of our businesses. We are pleased that the theme parks are essentially at the 20% margin that we talked about being the magical number. We prefer not to stop there.  ESPN obviously is substantial margins but as their sub fees moderate, it will be hard to grow their margins over the long term, even though ESPN will continue to deliver significant growth to the company. Even though their sub fees are starting to moderate a bit, they are coming off of a relatively high base.  We continue to look at growing our margins on the licensing side at Consumer Products. We have done a good job with that in the near term in the recent past. We are going to do some investing to grow licensing in general in Consumer Products which may not give us the ability in the near term to raise margins but the goal long term is to do just that.  Media networks in general, meaning other businesses in broadcasting, has always, as you know because it's a single revenue stream business, is always from a margin perspective dependent upon both the rating delivery and the market place. At least for now we are experiencing positive signs in both fronts. \nTom Staggs: I think I would add to it that as Bob alluded, there are a number of places where we are currently investing. In Consumer Products, Bob talked about our licensing capabilities. And as we noted in recent quarters, we have been seeing double-digit type increases in our earned royalties and that's really a direct result of the investment in those capabilities, both in terms of direct to retail and in terms of product categories.  We expect that investment to continue for the next couple of years and during that period of time, it may dampen margins; but the margin impact as you get beyond that and the growth, we think can be substantial. So that we are doing. As well in Consumer Products the investment of video games I mentioned in my prepared remarks, right now that dampens margins. To the extent we continue our success there, as you get out into steady state, you will see margin growth come from that as well.  The final thing I would mention is that we are investing, as you know, considerably in our digital initiatives. The Internet group in particular and as those initiatives mature, I think you will start to see that turn in terms of being a margin contributor as opposed to the opposite that we are experiencing now.  Club Penguin by the way is a nice exception, it actually has a nice margin already and it is a business that obviously we hope to grow it further. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank. \n Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank: Thanks very much. Also one for Tom and one for Bob. Tom, your comments that you are well on your way to double-digit EPS growth is oddly reminiscence of guidance. I was curious if you want to take a shot at whether you will see such growth continue in fiscal '08?  Bob, I guess the real question, I want to see if you felt the Pixar deal is tracking in line with your acquisition budgets, given Ratatouille, despite its critical success, is performing domestically a bit below the prior Pixar films? Thanks. \nTom Staggs: Well, you know, I'm sorry if it felt like that. I didn't mean to tease you. But at the end of the day, with EPS growth as substantial as it was in the first fine months, I felt it was reasonably obvious that we could probably achieve double-digit this year. With that, I would demure on talking specifically about '08 guidance. As you know, that's not something that we engage in. \nBob Iger: To your question about Pixar. First of all, when we evaluated the acquisition, we looked at their titles on a global basis, not just on a domestic basis and we think Ratatouille will be an extremely successful global property. We also believe that these are long-term products, meaning they will deliver value for the company for a long period of time. What we have learned, when you put the Pixar name or the Disney name on a high quality animated feature, it delivers results or shareholder value for decades to come. Witness how we did recently with bringing Peter Pan out into the marketplace or Little Mermaid. We think Ratatouille, because it is the best reviewed film of the year, and it is as good as it is, will drive that kind of long-term value.  We bought Pixar for multiple reasons. We clearly knew we wanted to bolster our animation efforts, which are critical to the company, but they also brought to the company quality and creativity and a significant amount of technological innovation. When we valued it, we clearly looked at the potential at the box office for the upcoming titles. We also looked at the potential at the box office for the Disney titles that Pixar management and creativity would deliver. We looked at all the other variables, like the long-term impact on high quality of the company, creativity in bringing their great technological experience to us.  So we really believe that Ratatouille ends up hitting the $200 million plus number that I mentioned in my remarks domestically and it does well internationally, which we are optimistic about, we've got a good solid title for the Walt Disney Company from a value perspective for many, many years to come. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from Spencer Wang - Bear Stearns. \n Spencer Wang - Bear Stearns: First on the broadcasting side, through the first nine months you have seen pretty good margin improvement. The revenues are flattish and costs are actually down 6%. How sustainable heading into '08 is it to continue to keep costs on a decline or should we expect some sort of reversion to the mean on the cost side?  Secondly Tom, can you give us a sense of how big the deposit was for the two cruise ships and how the payment schedule will work for the two ships? \nTom Staggs: Sure. With regard to broadcasting, as we have discussed in past for the prime time schedule at ABC this year, we ended up with an average cost per entertainment hour that was down somewhat versus the prior year and so that showed up in the results.  The important issue with regard to margins going forward is not so much the fourth quarter where the same programming cost dynamics are really in play, but it's really where we go with the new primetime schedule, et cetera. So we've got some hit shows that are returning. The costs will increase somewhat on those shows, as you would expect. I am not sure what reversion of the mean in payables but the bottom line is that our broadcasting group has been doing a very nice job of managing down their programming costs, even as they have gotten success. Those efforts are definitely going to continue and we will squeeze as much margin out of broadcasting as we can.  With regard to the cruise ships, the vast majority of the purchasing price of the cruise ships is back end loaded. That is the delivery of the ships. The deposit you would measure in tens of millions, not hundreds of millions and the biggest portion of the expenditure from that is yet to come in 2011 when the ships start to get delivered. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Gordon Hodge - Thomas Weisel Partners. \n Gordon Hodge - Thomas Weisel Partners: Yes, good afternoon. Just a quick question on Club Penguin, which I am pretty familiar with at home. It sounds like there's a lot of user-generated content involved there and as a result I gather it has a very high margin. I think you alluded to it being a high margin, but just trying to get a little bit more on the profitability there.  Also another question on the parks. I think you had a pension liability benefit this year and I'm just curious if you can give us a sense of what that might be going forward? Thanks. \nBob Iger: Gordon, we are not going to get specific on the margins of Club Penguin, except to say that they are significant, which obviously is one of the reasons why we believed that the asset was attractive. You talked about user-generated content. It's not all user-generated. Club Penguin does, in effect, create the framework for people to experience the online world. Kids have essentially their own experiences using their Avatars and you can buy igloos and furnish them, et cetera and so on, buy clothing. I guess to some extent it is mildly user generated.  But we really believe that the essence of Club Penguin is that it's simple, meaning it's easy to use. It doesn't require a significant amount of what I will call technological investment; it does require a significant amount of creativity, though. Keeping this fresh and innovative and essentially keeping the experience fresh for kids is something that we view as critically important to the long-term success of this property and it's one of the most attractive things we saw in it, in that the talented people who have created this and have been running it have been diffusing it with a fair amount of new creativity.  Again, we are fortunate. It's creativity that doesn't necessarily cost that much money but it is extremely vital and important. \nTom Staggs: With regard to pension and post-retirement medical costs, you are right. The theme parks had a benefit of about $125 million this year on an apples-to-apples, year-over-year basis. That was driven predominantly by a change in the market rate of interest at the time that the pension calculations have to be done, so that sort of dictated to us in terms of the methodology there.  As we look forward to this year, I don\u2019t see the same sort of year-over-year change in where interest rates are from the two measurement periods, and so I don't expect a similar dynamic to be in play next year. \n Gordon Hodge - Thomas Weisel:  But you don't foresee it reversing the other way, it sounds like. \nTom Staggs:  I don't expect it to be dramatically different one direction or the other. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from Michael Morris - UBS. \nMichael Morris - UBS: You noted international programming is bolstering your broadcasting segment this quarter. Can you give us some color on the magnitude of that contribution? Also the penetration, when you look at the global marketplace, how penetrated your product is and how much opportunity there is for growth there?  Secondly on the video game side, you have made a number of small acquisitions recently. Do you feel that the infrastructure that you have now is sufficient to monetize your properties or would you consider perhaps more sizable acquisitions to participate in this high growth business? Thank you. \nTom Staggs: Well, with regard to international sales of our television product, and really Desperate Housewives, Lost and Ugly Betty have been extremely well received in the international markets, and Grey's Anatomy as well although that was actually earlier in the year. But the order of magnitude there, it was one of the key drivers of the profit growth in the business, but that is to say I think that there's still growth in international markets to come. I think there's more penetration. The real driver of course, is going to be the continued success of the shows and so finding new hits and having those shows continue to succeed I think is going to be the biggest determinant of where that number goes from here. \nBob Iger:  The other thing that we have seen in terms of international television is significant growth in international home video for television properties. So not only have these TV shows done well on the platforms that they are airing on, largely terrestrial platforms around the world, but our home video unit has done a great job at selling them in DVD form in markets all over the world. That's been really interesting in terms of growth potential. It clearly supports the investment we have made in these properties.  On the video game side, we are comfortable with where we are from an infrastructure perspective, meaning the investments we made to-date, mostly in development talent, give us the ability to develop and create enough titles to grow the business nicely without putting more money at risk than we feel is appropriate or prudent.  We have looked, as we do in a number of businesses, at acquisition opportunities but as is typically the case, we don't comment on such things. We will continue to do so, but that shouldn't in any way suggest that we feel the need to acquire in that space in order to grow in that space. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from David Miller - SMH Capital. \nDavid Miller - SMH Capital: Congratulations on the solid results. Bob, we noticed that with the European release of Ratatouille the release by country is somewhat staggered. In fact, I don't think the film is set to be even released in some of the top 5 markets in terms of screen count until the fall.  I think you have Italy on October 19th, the UK on October 5, Germany is October 3. Those are all top 5 market in terms of screen count. Other than the overall competitive situation with flows of product out of the U.S. into the European marketplace, is there any other reason for that? \nBob Iger:  No, you hit it on the head, Dave. We are staying out of the way of some significant competition. You wouldn't want to compete against Harry Potter, as a for instance in the U.K. We stayed out of the way of Shrek and some of those other really big titles. We do open in a number of key markets this coming week. It's opening in France as a for instance. But the rollout is what I will call staggered for the reason that you cited, to basically create a competitive environment that we feel is healthy for the film. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Jacoby \u2013 Banc of America Securities. \nJonathan Jacoby \u2013 Banc of America Securities: Consumer products, how should we think about it going forward? Obviously had tremendous strength out of Cars; Ratatouille, perhaps not the same type of strength but is the licensing business strong enough as we go out? \nTom Staggs: By the way, Jonathan, I understand you had a baby. Congratulations. \nJonathan Jacoby \u2013 Banc of America Securities:  Thank you. \nTom Staggs:  We will have to make sure that they get enlisted in Club Penguin.  The Consumer Products revenues from Cars is really kind of a phenomenon. It's our most successful new animated film franchise since the Lion King. So any film that we would release in the last ten years would pale in comparison to where Cars has been. We are obviously thrilled with that and hope to see Cars continue.   Ratatouille has a more limited consumer products program, as you might imagine. At the same time, the most important thing to think about in our Consumer Products business, especially when it comes to licensing is that we have an unbelievably broad base of properties to draw from in growing that business. Andy Mooney and his team have done a good job of diversifying our business base across character franchises. You saw the great growth of Princess, the Fairies franchise is coming along well, Cars of course, has come on strong, Pirates of the Caribbean.  I don't know of any other company that has such a strong group of properties to draw from. As we invest in our capabilities over there, I think if you looked out in the long term, there is really strong growth potential for Consumer Products. That growth potential is around the world. \nBob Iger:  Tom, just to add to that, you mentioned diversifying our properties. We have diversified well beyond motion picture merchandise. With Disney Channel's success it has driven a lot of success for Consumer Products. We talk about High School Musical there's been a really strong program at retail. I mentioned that we have a back-to-school program at Wal-Mart that coincides with High School Musical 2 that is the biggest we have ever seen. We also have Hannah Montana and other Disney Channel properties.  The other thing we have done in the last two years is we brought back new versions of Mickey Mouse, in this case Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and Winnie the Pooh. Both are doing quite well in the preschool space and while both are designed to succeed on their own as programs on the channel and on international channels, they are clearly designed to help support two of Consumer Products\u2019 most valuable franchises, and that is Mickey Mouse and core characters, and Winnie the Pooh. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Tuna Amobi - Standard & Poor's. \nTuna Amobi - Standard & Poor\u2019s: Bob, given the nice publicity that was garnered by Secret of the Magic Gourd, I was wondering if that changes your philosophy in terms of the Disney branded local movies and if perhaps you can speak to the economics of those kind of productions?  Tom, if I heard you correctly it seems like there is potentially a huge disconnect in domestic parks between the attendance and the room reservations. If you can explain a little bit more about those dynamics, because I don't remember the last time I saw this type of variation. \nBob Iger:  Tuna, The Secret of the Magic Gourd which we released in China in July is actually the result of a strategy and a philosophy that we have about growing the company internationally. We believe that investing in Disney-branded local content is a very, very smart thing for us to do, as we seek too drive long-term growth outside of the United States. It's really important for us to be competitive locally and to do so, you have to put out product that is made in the marketplace, that is indigenous to those marketplaces.  Magic Gourd is really the first of what we hope to be the many such properties, both on the movie side and ultimately on the TV side. We are investing to make Disney-branded films in China beyond Magic Gourd; in India we announced a deal with Yash Raj films just a month ago, or in June actually, to make animated films in India. We believe we have opportunities in Russia. We have been doing a fair amount of investing in Latin America to make original Disney product. We're doing a number of things from a television perspective under the Disney Channel umbrella, along the same lines.  Again, a good way we believe to deploy our capital, Disney-branded; from an economic perspective, the cost of making this product in these markets, as you would expect, is substantially lower than what it would cost us to make similar product in the United States. Magic Gourd cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $5 million, as an example. It would be nice to make movies for that price in the United States, but I don't think I will see that during my lifetime. \nTom Staggs:  Tuna, as you pointed out we are seeing very strong bookings. Low double-digits ahead of the prior year, but I mentioned the attendance quarter to-date has been flat with the prior year. The biggest factor there, remember we are only a month into the quarter, but the biggest factor there really looks to have been the Fourth of July week, we had Fourth of July in the middle of week and that actually seemed to have a bigger impact than I would expected. Remember, we are comping against very strong attendance results in the prior year. July is a strong month every year. That impact itself we saw in the numbers. But as we look ahead, the bookings look strong and so we feel good about where the parks stand. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from Anthony DiClemente - Lehman Brothers. \nAnthony DiClemente - Lehman Brothers: In the past, I think investors have looked at Disney as a cyclical stock at times which is pretty tied directly to the U.S. economy and economic cycle, with the macro economic indicators that people have been focused on in the past couple of weeks, such as oil prices and the wealth effect. What is the strongest evidence now that you can see in your business, either over the past year or most recently that would suggest that assumption about Disney as a cyclical company is no longer the case? Thanks. \nBob Iger:  Well, most of our businesses typically do not rise and fall with the cyclicality of the market place. People still go to movies during good times and bad. Television remains popular. Use of the Internet continues to grow in a market place where there is some uncertainty. The only business where we have tended to see some fluctuation is in travel and tourism, which affects our theme parks. But by and large, that business has not been impacted by increases in oil or gasoline prices during good times and bad, and it doesn't seem like there's a direct correlation.  There typically has been a direct correlation between our theme park business and consumer confidence but that correlation has been broken over the last few years. Although we certainly would prefer consumer confidence to be up, which it was this week. We think that is a good sign. What had been a fairly consistent pattern of our parks and resorts business rising and falling with consumer confidence has not been as much the case over the last couple of years.  So for the most part, interestingly enough, we don't see our company as affected by the cyclicality that you cite. Maybe other people believe that we are. In general, the trends that we have seen in our theme parks have been quite positive and do not seem to have been affected. Clearly there are other situations in the world that have had an impact, like 9/11 back in 2001. There are some difficulties in traveling to the United States that we see today; tougher to get a visa, as a for instance. Just generally more difficult to travel internationally than it was. That has some effect, but in general, the businesses have not been as affected in effect by the overall market places as certain people expect. \nTom Staggs:  Anthony, I would make a couple of observations on top of that. That is as Bob said, the theme parks tended to rise and fall with the consumer confidence and spending and the wealth effect, et cetera. We're not saying that they are detached from that cycle but our businesses don't necessarily run in the same cycles. They can be countercyclical to one another.  I think one of the things that has happened in the past is that at certain points in time, we were perhaps in a down cycle in certain businesses like theme parks at the same time that we actually had a down cycle in some of our creative efforts. I think that has caused people to overestimate the degree to which the whole company is cyclical.  It's also one of the reasons that Bob and I have talked about the investments we are making in the creative processes of the company and making sure that creatively, the company is as healthy as it possibly can be, and that the creative strength is broad based and diversified across a number of businesses. That for us is a big focus as a management team.  We also try to make sure that we are as nimble as we can be on the cost side to the extent that we see downturns in businesses and we learned a lot about that over the last five years or so. So we don't pretend to be immune from individual cycles but there are a number of cycles at work in the company at any point in time. \nBob Iger:  The other thing that we have done, and the parks and resort team deserves a lot of credit for this, is they have gotten far more strategic from a pricing perspective, and they are reaching out in terms of their pricing efforts to a much broader demographic and so the $1,500 family of four package to Walt Disney World as a for instance is one example of that, just simply making the park more affordable or the resort more affordable to more people.  Having a pricing strategy that enables people to spend more time at the parks, in effect, the more you stay, the more you play, the less you pay, I guess is the way we put it. That has worked really well as well. It sort of breaks the correlation a bit; it makes us less susceptible. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from Jason Bazinet - Citigroup. \nJason Bazinet - Citigroup:  Thank you very much. Two strategic questions on ABC. Mr. Iger, I think you have spoken in the past about focusing on three brands: ESPN, Disney and ABC. I understand ESPN is for men and Disney for kids. I was just wonder, are you maybe without explicitly saying it, positioning ABC as a female network given the strength of Grey's and Desperate Housewives and some of the pilots?  My follow-up question is maybe a little bit stranger. But given your strategy, which I think most people on The Street agree with of insuring that the content creators capture more value and by extension, people in the distribution business get less, and we see that with retransmission and day and date and Internet availability of your shows; is it totally outlandish for you to potentially migrate ABC to a cable network so you can get the equivalent of retransmission fees, given your small exposure to the TV station side? Thanks. \nBob Iger:  Well, ABC is not purposefully positioning itself as a brand for women or female brand; although they have had great success in that direction led by the shows you mentioned, Desperate Housewives and Grey's Anatomy. It's not their intention to solely program in that direction or create a brand.  However, given the strength that their programs has in that direction, they have looked to develop more in that direction to take advantage of the audience they already have, whether it's audience flow or the marketing capabilities of shows that attract that audience provide. So we are not purposefully turning into a women's brand, but a lot of their programming is, in effect, geared to attract the women demographic.  On the second part of question, the one you deemed maybe a little bit more weird than the first one -- I don't know that it's necessarily weird, because that is in general a single revenue stream business, and then it has its challenges because of that. We have looked at a variety of different strategies when it comes to the network, and we will continue to, to basically figure out how to best operate that business going forward and more specifically, deliver long-term shareholder value.  The idea you referenced was to turn it into a cable network has come up at times, but the times that we have evaluated it, we concluded that it would not be in the best interest of the company to do so. The economics, actually would have been more strained than anything else. We will continue to look at the way that business is run. It is something that Anne Sweeney spends a fair amount of time on, whether it's on the cost side to Tom's point earlier about costs or to the other question, or on the revenue-generating side. But the idea that you mentioned is not something that we are considering. \nTom Staggs: You don't want to dismiss the strength of some of the local franchises that are represented by the affiliates and by our own stations. They actually have very strong in market franchises that I wouldn't dismiss too lightly in thinking about that equation. \nOperator: Your final question comes from Rich Greenfield - Pali Capital. \nRich Greenfield - Pali Capital: When you look at your capital expenditures and your theme parks, you had talked about increased investment at your analyst meeting a few months ago, but your expense domestically was up about 20% after six months and up about 40% after the nine months. Just maybe looking for more color on where that capital specifically is going and how you see the early returns on some of the investment spending you have done so far this year at the theme parks domestically.  The question that was asked earlier in terms of how to leverage this whole Club Penguin theme. Do you think it's possible to create things like Club Mickey or Club Pooh and utilize some of your core characters to build out or create simultaneous worlds, similar to what MTV has tried in taking MTV Laguna Beach, The Hills, et cetera, to build off of great technology? Thanks very much. \nBob Iger: I will take question two. We actually do believe that we have ample opportunities to create virtual online worlds with multiple character sets. As I mentioned, and as you know, we have Pirates coming out later this year. We have Disney Fairies which is largely Tinkerbell derived which is already up and will expand in terms of what kids will be able to do. We have been talking a lot about the potential that Cars has online. Not only do we believe that it will live in that space nicely but it really will help keep the franchise vital, particularly when you consider the Consumer Products value as we talked about earlier.  As for Mickey core characters and Pooh, certainly there are opportunities there too. You have to look at the demographics. Pooh for instance, tends to be very young, and typically kids that go online and participate in or experience virtual worlds seem to be a little bit younger than the typical Pooh demographic, but we have Toontown right now where there are some of the Mickey and other Disney core characters present there.  This is a space that we think is only going to grow, and we believe that there's a huge value to existing franchises being in that space, but you can't just snap your fingers and get it done. You have to think through it very carefully. What Club Penguin has done is to design a great experience, one that kids can enjoy from the moment they go on the site; it is relatively easy to enter, easy to navigate. It's also very important that it is safe which we feel very strongly about, particularly when you apply the Disney brand to it. We will continue to invest in this direction, both in creating new characters and franchises for the space but also taking characters and franchises from other platforms and putting them in that space. \nTom Staggs:  With regard to capital expenditures, the domestic parks are up about $150 million in spending year over year thus far and both from the standpoint of what happened in the quarter and for the nine months, the biggest year over year Delta is the deposit on the cruise ships that we talked about. While it's a relatively small percentage of the overall cost of the ship, it's meaningful in the context of the capital expenditures for the quarter.  But we are also investing in things like the submarine ride at Disneyland. We continue to put new guest offerings out there but we also think there's a real opportunity to put more of the Pixar properties into the parks. These are really well-loved properties. There's an opportunity to give the guests that and further differentiate our parks from other parks around the world.  We have got another attraction under construction in California and later in Florida that capitalizes on the Pixar franchises, and so you see that spending continue. We think there's a real opportunity to further differentiate ourselves in that regard. That's really what is driving that difference that you cite. Thanks. \nLowell Singer : Rich, thanks. Thank you, everyone again for joining us today.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for the Walt Disney Company. Please proceed. \nLowell Singer: Okay, thanks and good afternoon, everyone. We want to welcome you to the Walt Disney Company\u2019s fourth quarter 2008 earnings call. Our press release was issued a few minutes ago. It\u2019s now available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today\u2019s call will also be webcast and that will be available on our website, as will a replay and a transcript of today\u2019s remarks.  Joining me here in Burbank are Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tom Staggs, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob and Tom will lead off with some comments and then we will of course be happy to take your questions. I will then come back to read the Safe Harbor provision.  So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob. \nRobert A. Iger: Thank you very much, Lowell and good afternoon. While we are announcing our fourth quarter and year-end earnings today, there is no question that current business conditions and our response to them are of great interest and relevance and we will spend most of our time discussing them.  We are pleased with our fiscal 2008 results. Despite a steadily weakening economy, we delivered a very solid performance for the year, posting record revenue, operating income, and earnings per share. Our strong assets and brands, our creativity, our strategy, and the strength of our management team enabled us to remain relatively resilient throughout the year and we are pleased with the results.  However, in recent weeks as the economy deteriorated, our pace of business has been impacted and I will briefly describe the conditions we are experiencing and talk about the steps we are taking to mitigate them.  It is important to note that it is difficult for us to predict the length or depth of the global economic downturn and consequently the impact on our businesses. Let me describe the business conditions we are experiencing.  On the advertising front, we have seen significant softening in the local ad market, as well as a slowing of the pace of national advertising. On the local level, our exposure is quite limited, with only 10 television stations. But even though we lead in most markets and have benefited from political spending, advertising revenue at our stations is off considerably from this time last year. The decline is being led by domestic automotive manufacturers but weakness in other key sectors is also taking its toll.  On the national level, ad pacings at ABC and to a lesser extent ESPN are off from last year as spending in the auto, electronics, financial, and other categories has slowed. I would also note that overall broadcast television ratings are down so far this season and ABC is no exception. The writers\u2019 strike is partially to blame. At the same time, industry-wide cable and broadcast television viewership is up versus last year, as both the financial crisis and the election have captured viewer attention, with cable news being the primary beneficiary.  ABC leads in the important C3 category, and we like our overall position in the marketplace, given our attractive demographics. But our goal is to strengthen our schedule with the addition of numerous mid-season programs.  At ESPN, the brand and its programming are incredibly strong and there may be opportunities to add to its strength in this environment.  At our parks and resorts, attendance has held up reasonably well and thus far this quarter, it is down only 1% versus last year at our domestic parks. However, bookings during the last month have fallen off considerably. Part of this change is likely a reflection of consumers taking a wait-and-see approach to the economy, or waiting to see if the market produces discounts.  Bookings at Walt Disney World during the upcoming two-week holiday period are down only 1%. At parks and resorts, our brand and the experiences we offer have never been stronger. But consumer confidence is the lowest we have seen in over three decades and even the best product out there is feeling the effect.  We are also tracking the economy\u2019s impact on retail and while we have great in-demand merchandise in the marketplace, we believe consumer spending will be down. That could impact us possibly during the holiday season but almost certainly during calendar 2009.  I realize this is a sobering outlook but we are extremely confident in our ability to contend with current conditions successfully and to rebound strongly when they improve.  During the last several weeks, our senior management team has stepped up to the task of identifying and implementing steps to reduce expenses and to create more efficient operations. Many of these steps are designed to mitigate current conditions but some we expect to have long-lasting benefits and significant savings will be delivered.  At parks and resorts, our experience during previous downturns, especially the challenging period after 9-11, taught us to be very good at managing variable expenses based on variable demand. We will do this while preserving the quality of the guest experience, something we consider sacred.  Reductions in operating costs will necessarily respond to a reduction in attendance and occupancies. We are also putting in place new marketing initiatives and accompanying pricing incentives designed to stimulate bookings and attendance during the first half of 2009. Details of this promotional offer will be announced tonight by the parks.  Our yield management program is designed to deliver results in both good times and bad and should serve us well in this environment. The pricing strategies we implemented a few years ago to increase length of stay while delivering value to the consumer will also help, as will our new what will you celebrate campaign, which has already produced almost 1 million registrants for a program that kicks in on the first of the year.  Our company\u2019s executive team has been tested by and managed their businesses through very challenging times in the past and not only are they responding well to today\u2019s conditions but their experience will enable us to operate effectively in this marketplace.  On the investment front, we are going forward with a number of announced initiatives, like our two new cruise ships and our increased investment in videogames. We are taking a very pragmatic approach to new investments across the company and will press ahead only in those areas we believe offer the greatest opportunity for long-term growth and returns.  Our strategic focus these past few years has been on high quality branded product that successfully spans multiple technology platforms across geographical and cultural boundaries. That is where we are investing the most capital and we continue to deliver solid results.  Our strategy for creating and building franchises is working well, illustrated most recently by the success of High School Musical and Fairies. We remain excited about the prospect of and will continue to invest in key franchises, from Cars to Princesses and from Pirates to Toy Story, Mickey Mouse, Pooh, Hannah Montana, and The Jonas Brothers.  Our brand strength, competitive position, and business strategy will serve us very well in this environment, as they did in 2008, and I am confident that just as those elements delivered resiliency during this past year, they will position us well to recover as market conditions improve. We remain committed to creating quality product and long-term shareholder value no matter what the environment. Most of all, we remain optimistic about the future of Disney -- this is a strong company with great assets, great brands, great people, great creativity, and a significant global reach, all of which will help us surmount the challenges we face today and allow us to prosper in the years to come.  And now I will turn it over to Tom Staggs. Tom. \nThomas O. Staggs: Thanks, Bob and good afternoon, everyone. Despite a challenging environment, our 2008 performance translated into a double-digit increase in earnings per share, not including gains on the sale of the [inaudible] Weekly last year. Our broad-based success in 2008 provides further evidence of the competitive strength of our company and our strategy. But as Bob indicated, during Q4 and thus far in Q1, the environment has deteriorated further, which is reflected somewhat in our Q4 results. Rather than recap the year as a whole, I will highlight a few of the key drivers for last quarter and then address the trends we are seeing so far in fiscal 2009.  At media networks, ESPN once again delivered strong growth as higher affiliate revenue more than offset lower advertising revenue. ESPN also benefited from the recognition of $37 million more in deferred affiliate revenue compared to the prior year quarter. ESPN\u2019s ad sales declined in part due to softness in the auto and consumer electronics categories. Olympic ad spending may also have contributed to the decline. Our Q4 results reflected improved performance from lifetime and higher affiliate revenue from Disney Channel and ABC Family.  At broadcasting, the impact of lower ratings at the ABC network was partially offset by higher CPMs. Expenses increased in the quarter as higher pilot costs shifted from Q3 to Q4 this year, due to the WGA strike. We also incurred higher production costs from political news coverage.  Operating results of the Internet group were somewhat better than in the prior Q4 as savings from the shut-down of the Disney mobile phone service were partially offset by investments for our international mobile and online operations and our Disney.com website.  Our TV stations continue to outperform the competition in ratings, with eight of our 10 stations ranking number one in their respective markets. However, weakness in the local ad market resulted in a revenue decline at the stations of nearly 12%, driven primarily by lower automotive ad spending, which has traditionally been the station\u2019s largest category.  At parks and resorts, higher guest spending in our domestic parks and Disneyland Resort Paris were the primary drivers of revenue growth in Q4. Operating income, however, was impacted by higher expenses at Walt Disney World and a two-and-a-half week dry-docking of the Disney Magic Cruise Ship that is part of the ship\u2019s routine maintenance schedule.  In the fourth quarter, combined attendance at our domestic parks came in slightly above last year\u2019s Q4, despite the softening economy, with a modest increase at Walt Disney World offsetting a slight decline at Disneyland.  For the fiscal year as a whole, we delivered record domestic theme park attendance and Disneyland Resort Paris set a new attendance record as well. In Q4, higher average ticket pricing at our domestic parks helped drive a 4% increase in guest spending. Walt Disney World occupancy was 89%, off just one percentage point versus the prior year, while Disneyland\u2019s occupancy came in four percentage points lower than last year at a still solid 87%.  At the same time, we saw continued strength in per room spending at our domestic resorts, with an increase of 5% for the quarter. Disneyland Resort Paris has performed well all year and reported higher revenue and operating income in Q4, reflecting higher ticket pricing and strong per room spending. Results also benefited from favourable currency rates.  Turning to studio entertainment, operating income was lower in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the performance of Swing Vote and Miracle at St. Anna and higher marketing spending for Q1 theatrical releases, which include Beverly Hills Chihuahua.  At consumer products, the scope and strength of Disney\u2019s franchises continued to bolster our performance in merchandise licensing. Robust demand for High School Musical and Hannah Montana products helped to drive double-digit increases in earned royalties for the fourth quarter. Our broad base of successful franchises and our solid positioning with mass retailers, like Walmart, Target, Testco, and Carfour, should help mitigate the impact of a retail downturn and position our merchandise licensing business well for the long-term.  As anticipated, the Disney Stores North America contributed to revenue growth in the quarter but also drove a reduction in operating margins.  As detailed in the press release, we took a reserve that impacted EPS by $0.03 per share in Q4 relating to a receivable we hold from Lehman Brothers that arose through foreign exchange hedge transactions with them. While we are now fully reserved for this receivable, we continue to pursue payment.  With that, let me expand a bit on what we are seeing in the current environment. As Bob noted, attendance thus far in the quarter has held up reasonably well but the pace of bookings for our domestic resorts has slowed meaningfully since about the time of the Lehman bankruptcy. Our current room reservations on the books for the first two quarters of our fiscal year are a little under 10% below the prior year, with Q1 bookings down somewhat less than what we are seeing so far for Q2.  We also believe that the booking window could contract from the 12 to 13 weeks we have experienced in recent quarters, which makes it more difficult to interpret these trends.  Bob also discussed the softness in the ad market -- at the network, our scatter pricing has been running low double-digit percentages ahead of up-front pricing but the pace of scatter sales for Q1 are down appreciably. Option pick-ups for Q2 are currently only modestly behind last year.  Ad pacings are down versus last year at ESPN, though slightly ahead of where we came out for Q4. Pacings at ABC Family are up nicely so far in Q1.  It\u2019s worth noting that advertising represents less than 30% of our cable networks\u2019 revenues and for the company as a whole, advertising is just under 20% of our revenue.  Studio entertainment faces a tough Q1 comparison this year, given the success of last year\u2019s DVD releases, especially Pirates 3. Key theatrical releases in fiscal 2009 include the recently released High School Musical 3, our animated release Bolt, coming to theatres on November 21st, Bedtime Stories being released on December 25th, and Disney Pixar\u2019s Up and G-Force, both slated for release this coming summer.  In 2009, we expect to increase our investment in a number of strategic initiatives that include film and TV programming, including local content production in key emerging markets and in digital media. We will continue to invest in developing our videogame publishing business. We incurred roughly $170 million in videogame development costs in 2008 and we currently expect to increase our videogame investment by $75 million to $100 million in 2009.  Our videogame release for this fiscal year include titles based on Hannah Montana, High School Musical, and Bolt.  In addition, we expect to invest in key initiatives we have identified at parks and resorts, including the renovation and expansion of Disney California Adventure at Disneyland Resort, new vacation club properties, as well as the construction of the two new ships at Disney Cruise Lines, which Bob mentioned.  Over the past several years, we have returned substantial capital to shareholders via our dividends and share buy-backs. We have done so while at the same time strengthening our balance sheet and enhancing our liquidity. As a result, we are in a very strong capital position. In the current environment, that strength is more important than ever and better capitalized companies will likely be better able to take advantage of opportunities to improve their market share and competitive position.  With this in mind, and given the recent turmoil in the debt markets, we are not expending capital on share repurchases for the time being. However, given the substantial gap between our share price and our estimate of intrinsic value, to the extent we are once again inclined to pay out capital shareholders over and above our regular dividend, we would be back in the market for our stock.  Disney has a strong balance sheet, a diversified revenue base, and substantial long-term earnings growth and cash flow potential. Even more importantly, the company\u2019s brand strength and business models confer competitive advantage that we expect will sustain us through this economic cycle and create substantial value for our shareholders far into the future.  With that, I will turn the call back to Lowell for Q&A. \nLowell Singer: Okay, thanks, Tom. Operator, we are ready for the first question. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Benjamin Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. \nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe we could focus in on the cable network side at ESPN and give us a little bit of a sense of the category exposures we had in -- obviously there\u2019s a lot of news flow on the auto sector, potential consolidation. And maybe you could expand that to the station group as well. Just give us a sense for how much you think the overall ad business at Disney is exposed to autos, how that has been trending national versus local, and how that might be impacting ESPN in particular. \nThomas O. Staggs: Autos is one of the -- is the largest category at the stations, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. It\u2019s also quite a large category for ESPN, although much less so at the network, and there we\u2019ve seen a fair amount of softness. Bob mentioned in his remarks that electronics has come down. That\u2019s somewhat -- it\u2019s not as big at the stations, although it\u2019s an important category for ESPN and can be an important category for ABC as well.  And these categories are down to varying degrees. The ones that we mentioned are all down sort of double-digit percentages year over year, and so that\u2019s where we are seeing the most acute softness. \nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Any early look at sort of capital expenditures in fiscal -- in the next fiscal year versus this year?\nThomas O. Staggs: Well, we\u2019re taking a look at it. The fact that we\u2019ve got California Adventure and some of the payments, schedule payments for the cruise line, I suspect that we will see capital expenditures increase somewhat for the year. The pace of spending is something we are taking a hard look at, given the environment, and so we are not making any specific projections now. But I think that you will see some increase in capital for \u201909 versus \u201908. \u201908 came in pretty close to 2007. \nRobert A. Iger: But we\u2019ll end up spending less than we would have spent, but since it\u2019s a number that we haven\u2019t really disclosed, it probably doesn\u2019t mean all that much to you. \nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Thanks a lot. \nLowell Singer: Ben, thanks for the questions. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson of Deutsche Bank.\nDoug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank: Thanks very much. Your predecessor, Bob, once told me that it\u2019s easier to manage in hard times than it is in good times, because people expect the cost cuts to be coming. When you look across your businesses, I guess in particular for broadcast and cable, how much flexibility do you have in your cost structure? I mean, are you going to focus on trying to manage margins to flat or how do you manage your production costs at those businesses?\nRobert A. Iger: Well first of all, I find that it\u2019s more fun to manage in good times than in tough -- whether it\u2019s easier or not is another story. I mentioned in my remarks, Doug, and you know a lot of the people who work here, this is a team that has managed through not only good times, particularly these last three years, but really tough times, particularly in the 2001 period. So not only have we gone through this before but we have gotten better at it, particularly at parks and resorts.  And first, across the company, there are a number of steps that are being taken to mitigate the downturn. There\u2019s some consolidation that will occur. Clearly we are finding efficiencies in businesses that as you look harder for them, you deliver more of them. We will reduce some operating expenses, some production expenses. We talked about cancellation or delay or scaling back of certain investments when it comes to CapEx.  At parks and resorts, because so much of what they spend is variable based on variable demand, as I mentioned, a lot of the savings that they are focused on delivering are due to that -- essentially they reduce some of their offerings because there will be less demand for them. An example would simply be the frequency of some of our entertainment, which doesn\u2019t change the quality of the experience at all, because you would simply have fewer people that are available, but it does give us an opportunity again to reduce expense with fewer people in attendance at our parks.  We\u2019ve also discovered that as the business has both diversified and spread globally, there are opportunities to standardize some of our processes that we didn\u2019t necessarily have when we were either smaller business and we were less diverse. And we are spending a fair amount of time or the parks and resorts team is spending a fair amount of time looking at that. That should deliver some interesting efficiencies.  And a lot of attention is being paid to -- well, both on the revenue management side, that we have pretty sophisticated in place that work well for us in very robust times but will continue to work well for us now, and we have some very, very solid marketing offerings in the marketplace -- the what will you celebrate, which enables people to visit the parks for free on the day of their birthday, but encourages people to celebrate other events at our parks, the timing couldn\u2019t be better for that. About seven in 10 people who vacationed in the last year said they vacationed to celebrate something, so this plays very well into that.  And tonight the parks are announcing what I think will be a very, very attractive offering to the consumer because of the consumer\u2019s demand for value these days, and that is a four-plus-three package. Again, the details are going to be announced later on today but this gives people the ability to basically pay for four days and four nights in our parks and our hotels, but stay for seven. And in addition to that, there is an offering that if you book fairly soon, you will get a $200 gift card you can spend on food and merchandise.  And this will be available in the marketplace right away but for a limited time, and available for people to take advantage of during the first half calendar 2009. The consumer today clearly is being very, very careful about what they spend, how much they spend, rather, and what they spend it on and I think the price-to-value relationship has probably never been more critical. And I think that plays very well for a company like ours because brand becomes really important and the price-to-value that a brand like Disney can offer, whether you are offering a travel package, selling a DVD, selling a movie, or selling consumer products, I think sets us up very well in what clearly is a very, very challenging time. \nThomas O. Staggs: Doug, the only thing I would add is that if you think about our cable businesses, we are obviously skewed heavily towards affiliate fees, as I mentioned, as opposed to advertising, and so there I think that while we\u2019ve got in ESPN\u2019s case a fair degree of semi-fixed costs in sports rights, the margin impact would be more modest than say what you might see at an all-ad supported network, where again programming is reasonably well locked in, although we are looking at opportunities to save costs where we can.  I think you should assume that in a business like the parks, to the extent that revenues were down, you would see that in the margin as well because of the high fixed cost nature of the parks as a whole. \nDoug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank: Thank you. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, Doug. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Spencer Wang of Credit Suisse.\nSpencer Wang - Credit Suisse: I have a question on the theme parks -- Bob, you talked about how some of the costs are variable in nature, and you can right-size some of the costs. I was wondering, in the last recession I believe park margins decreased roughly about 500 basis points year-on-year, so I was wondering if you could give us a sense of given the current environment, would the margin impact be perhaps more mitigated this time around?  And then I guess the second part of the question, maybe for Tom, is in comparable times when the booking window is narrowed, can you talk about how the booking number down 10% you are talking about, maybe how it is translated in terms of ultimate or actual attendance growth or decline? Thank you. \nRobert A. Iger: As I said in my remarks, attendance so far this quarter is down very marginally domestically, 1%, and bookings for the Christmas season, the two-week holiday period, are down around 1% as well. That\u2019s very, very small. And so at the moment, because of attendance and because of our near-term bookings -- I mean, bookings through what I\u2019ll call calendar 2008 are what they are, I don\u2019t think you will see that much need for us to vary our expenses because our attendance is likely not to vary as much.  In terms of what happens beyond January 1, we can\u2019t predict right now. Tom talked about our bookings but we just don\u2019t know whether what we are seeing is simply a shortening of the bookings window. And so I can\u2019t say right now whether our ability to manage through a downturn will be better this time, in terms of resulting in better margins. But I can say that our experience in 2001 will be quite helpful during this period of time, which at least gives us the ability to not suffer the margin reduction to the extent that we suffered in 2001 but again, I\u2019m not making an absolute prediction on that. \nThomas O. Staggs: No two economic environments are exactly alike, and so that makes it more difficult to say precisely how things will work out. There\u2019s a couple of things going for us in this instance -- the health of our vacation club business, the health of our cruise line business, the high degree of value-priced rooms that we have, the pricing strategy that the parks put in place a few years ago -- I think all of those things bode well for us and Bob of course mentioned that that team and the rest of the company\u2019s ability to respond appropriately. But as Bob said, for periods that are going to be busy periods, like the two-week holiday period, we won\u2019t vary the offerings because we are not going to sacrifice guest experience at all.  Now, on the shoulder periods and that sort of thing between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the shoulder periods thereafter, we\u2019ll have to take a hard look and see where we stand and then proceed accordingly.  With regard to the booking windows coming in some, and what 10% for the first few quarters would translate to, it\u2019s really too early to make that prediction, to be blunt. Because without knowing exactly how much of that is a contraction of the booking window and how much of it might be people that are deferring vacations, and that\u2019s what we found in the past people do, they defer the vacation and so we get them to the park later on.  It\u2019s difficult to say at this point, so we are really not making a prediction. \nRobert A. Iger: Spencer, as you know, we were fairly resilient through 2008 and I think most people were surprised that we held up as well as we did through what was a pretty challenging year and a year that got even more challenging as it progressed. And I think a lot of the resilience that we showed was due to the things that Tom pointed out, a more diverse business, a stronger brand, by the way, which I think had a really positive impact on our theme parks, the pricing strategies, the revenue yield management, and accessibility. We\u2019ve talked a lot about our room mix where in prior recessions, we didn\u2019t have nearly as many value-priced rooms, which I think sets us up at least in a tougher environment to be more attractive or more accessible when people are looking for value. But again, we\u2019re seeing a marketplace today that clearly is tougher than it was throughout our fiscal 2008, and our ability to predict is very limited. \nSpencer Wang - Credit Suisse: Great. Thank you very much. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, Spencer. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Nathanson of Sanford Bernstein.\nMichael Nathanson - Sanford C. Bernstein: Thanks. I have two but going from the last two, if I can dig a little deeper, let\u2019s just assume that the current trends, the next two quarters pace of business stands, and I wonder -- can you take out variable costs fast enough to hold margins, if that is indeed the rate that materializes? That\u2019s the first question. \nThomas O. Staggs: Well, I\u2019m not going to make predictions about what happens in the quarter but as I said, the parks have a high fixed cost base and they have a part of the cost that is variable. The team knows how to deal with that but to the extent that there is a meaningful downturn in revenues, I think you are going to see an impact in the margin line. \nMichael Nathanson - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay, and the second one would be given your focus in film is more family, I wonder, are you seeing anything different on demand for DVDs, current or catalog, this quarter? Anything changed on that on the demand side for DVDs?\nRobert A. Iger: We actually have had a pretty good year from a DVD perspective, I mean, per title. There\u2019s some ins and outs because we had stronger titles a year ago but we have not really seen softness in our DVDs. We think part of the reason for that is it\u2019s a title driven business and the titles that we\u2019ve had in the marketplace are strong and attractive and there\u2019s brand value as well.  By the way, we haven\u2019t announced this but we will now -- we came out in the marketplace roughly a week ago with a Tinkerbell DVD, which is direct-to-video, the first of what will be four Fairies titles, and we sold 2 million units in the United States in seven days. So while there might be some pressure on the business in general, we like how we are positioned in the business and this is obviously a result of the studio\u2019s focus on Disney titles as well.  We\u2019ll know a lot more as the year progresses but we are in the marketplace differently in many respects than our competitors. We have fewer titles in general and most of them bear the Disney the brand, and in a market where consumers are looking for price-to-value relationship, we\u2019re delivering it. \nMichael Nathanson - Sanford C. Bernstein: Thanks. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, Michael. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Morris of UBS.\nMichael Morris - UBS: Thank you. With regard to the foreign exchange, can you give us a little insight in terms of what your exposure is there, both I guess which currencies you may be more exposed to, how it could impact you, an update on hedging and when that could impact you? And then also, you answer this I think on pretty much every call but what percentage of parks visitation is from foreign visitors? And with the weakness that you are seeing in the bookings right now, can you tell if any of that is coming from your foreign customers? Thank you. \nThomas O. Staggs: First with regard to foreign exchange, I\u2019ve discussed in the past that we tend to enter our fiscal years pretty well hedged and close to 100% hedged from foreign currency exposure based on our projection at that point in time, and therefore we tend not to get a tremendous amount of volatility in our earnings as a result of foreign exchange fluctuations during the year, and 2009 is such an instance.  I mean, the impact of foreign exchange rates in 2008 on the bottom line was about $0.03 a share, probably, all in, in that ballpark. So that\u2019s one side of the equation. The other, which relates to your question, is I think that we\u2019ve mentioned in the past that one of the strongest categories, the strongest category from a percentage standpoint, in attendance at our domestic parks last year was international visitors and so that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll keep our eye on.  To your question, it\u2019s a little early for us to make any judgments about that for the year as a whole. Foreign visitors are still a strong category for the attendance for the quarter to date but I wouldn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t yet draw any great inference from that, so it would remain to be seen what happens to the dollar and also what happens with that category.  I think that we have found that the appeal of the Disney vacation experience for international visitors has -- is very, very strong. The intent to visit domestically, the intent to visit internationally is still strong. When there\u2019s a downturn, that intent tends to build up some as people can defer over that period of time.  But if you look at Walt Disney World attendance for 2008, it was about 20% from international guests and that\u2019s up a bit from the prior year, not quite on a percentage basis up to historical peaks but still strong. \nMichael Morris - UBS: Thank you. \nLowell Singer: Thank you, Mike. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Imran Khan.\nImran Khan - J.P. Morgan: Thank you for taking my questions. The question is about your future asset mix -- Bob, as you look at the company over the next three to five years, how important is the television business to you for -- you know, what kind of synergistic value do you see? And also in the past you talked about the videogame -- how do you see the value of owning a big studio in Disney? Thank you. \nRobert A. Iger: Well, commenting about the asset mix in terms of potential divestitures or acquisitions is not something I want to do. We get asked a lot about our television business, particularly our TV station business. We have 10 stations, as you know. They are stellar performers in their markets. Interesting, I just looked at the ratings for election night and in a lot of the big markets that we operate in, our stations equaled or exceeded the ratings of some of our biggest competitors combined. And I think that\u2019s a testament to the management strength of that business, as well as to the asset value that they\u2019ve created, particularly the local news brand.  These are businesses for us that deliver high capital returns and while they have been a low growth, I guess in the past year because of the fall-off in advertising, no growth, we still believe in them because of the way that we run them and the free cash flow that they throw off for this company.  On the videogame side, again I\u2019m not going to comment about potential acquisitions. I\u2019ll comment on the business -- we still see this as a growth business. We\u2019re investing accordingly. We\u2019ve always said, whether it relates to videogames or any of our other businesses, that we will be opportunistic in terms of acquisitions, looking for things that fit our strategy well and that will deliver long-term growth and returns to our shareholders.  We have also a strong balance sheet and that gives us the opportunity to be opportunistic or to take advantage of opportunities when they arise. \nImran Khan - J.P. Morgan: Thank you. \nLowell Singer: Okay, Imran, thanks. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wienkes of Goldman Sachs.\nMark Wienkes - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. I\u2019m just wondering, you mentioned the 12 or 13-week window into bookings, but what\u2019s the typical percentage of business on the books at this point in time for the forward half, the first half of the forward year?\nThomas O. Staggs: That\u2019s actually not something that we tend to discuss, partly because it varies from quarter to quarter and it\u2019s a tough thing to read into and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s indicative of where things are going, so we don\u2019t give sort of percentage booked information as we go along. There are a number of things that go into that; for instance, the degree to which it\u2019s a quarter that\u2019s heavy in the travel trade versus convention business, et cetera, and how quickly those folks book but the 12 to 13-week window works pretty well for domestic and international tourist-based business. \nMark Wienkes - Goldman Sachs: Right. But the current pacing number that you quoted, you I guess wouldn\u2019t have given it out if it wasn\u2019t somewhat relevant, at least. \nThomas O. Staggs: Well as I said, the rooms on the books, the pace vis-\u00e0-vis last year if you look at Q1 and Q2 combined, is down slightly more than 10% than where the number of rooms on the books were at this time last year, so slightly less than 10%. \nMark Wienkes - Goldman Sachs: Understood, and then not to get overly detailed on the promotion that you mentioned, but the four and three or whatever the appropriate title of it is, is it fair to say the tradeoff here is low incremental margins per attendee and the goal is to fill the parks to help cover the fixed costs? Or how do you think about the profitability of that promotion?\nThomas O. Staggs: Well, no, I think that a good way to think about it is that what we do is we extend length of stay, we provide certainly a greater promotional value to the guests, and the -- what you would end up with at the end of the day, all other things equal, is a slightly lower average daily rate at the hotels with people -- while we increase volume to people. This by the way, it\u2019s not the biggest promotion we\u2019ve ever done. In fact, it\u2019s not the biggest percentage discount that we\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s actually reasonably consistent with what we have seen in the past, as recently as 2003. It\u2019s been effective in that regard and I have every reason to believe that it would be effective again here. \nRobert A. Iger: Also, you have a marketplace that based on our research tells us that people want to take vacations during 2009 but they are going to be much more value-focused, and this gives -- which I think is one of the reasons why we have seen our bookings fall off some what -- this gives us an opportunity to provide a catalyst to both early bookings and possibly better attendance or stronger attendance as the 2009 calendar year unfolds. It\u2019s a stimulant, in many ways, and while there is some cost to us, we believe long-term the benefits will outweigh that. \nMark Wienkes - Goldman Sachs: All right. Okay, that make sense. Thank you. \nLowell Singer: Thank you, Mark. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer.\nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer: Besides deferred revenue, were there any one-time items that impacted cable network revenue in the quarter? And then can you just comment with respect to the pilot and the development costs -- obviously that was significant and had a tremendous impact on the lost broadcasting. Do you expect any of that to trickle into the next quarter or did that mostly get finished at this quarter? Thanks. \nThomas O. Staggs: With regard to -- we mentioned in the press release, we referred to the sale of a European cable asset, so we recognized a gain on that in the quarter. It was roughly $20 million in the quarter. Of course last year, we recognized a settlement with a European distributor that improved the results last year, that was a benefit that was slightly greater, so those sort of offset each other in the current year comparisons.  With regard to pilot costs, they were higher. Pilot costs, pilot abandonments in Q4 for activity that usually takes place in Q3, most of that, virtually all of that took place then. As we look at 2009, I think there\u2019s a couple of things to bear in mind. One is because we had a strike shortened season last year, there will be more original episodes of programming on the air this year, 2009, that is. That pushes costs up somewhat. We\u2019ve also got a number of shows which have continued to show great success and reached fourth and fifth years on the air, Grey\u2019s Anatomy, et cetera, and costs for those shows tend to go up some over time but we\u2019ve structured our contract so that it\u2019s not -- it doesn\u2019t impact the profitability dramatically but we will see increasing costs from that perspective. But the pilot piece was pretty much through in Q4. \nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer: Thank you. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, Jason. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Jessica Reif-Cohen of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.\nJessica Reif-Cohen - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. I would like to follow-up on comments that both Tom and Bob made -- Tom, I was wondering if you could elaborate on your comments about the -- you said the health of the cruise ship line and timeshare -- it sounded like things were really good there, so if you could talk about bookings and sales.  And then Bob, you said something right at the beginning of the call regarding ESPN, that there were opportunities for investment and I was hoping you would elaborate -- are you talking about international opportunities? And I guess the final thing is on affiliate fee growth for ESPN -- you are in the middle of many of those original contracts that were resigned. Can you just talk about what the growth rate is for affiliate fees now?\nThomas O. Staggs: Let me talk for a second on cruise and DVC and again, we\u2019ll try to talk about what we\u2019ve been seeing lately and not so much trying to make predictions but when it comes to cruise, for example, after 9-11 we saw that business hold up quite well, the same could be said for DVC. And the -- now we only have currently two cruise ships to fill. We occupy a very comfortable niche in that business. We are not making predictions that we won\u2019t see any impact but at the same time, we think we are very well-positioned in the cruise business with a really strong product and should fair relatively well.  With regard to DVC, DVC wasn\u2019t a big driver in last quarter but that\u2019s in large part because we recognized revenue on a percent completion basis. The sales of DVC units were actually quite strong but because we were selling properties that were on an average basis less complete on a percentage basis, less of the revenue from those sales were recognized, and so that strength didn\u2019t show up in the quarter.  Where that goes from there, we\u2019re not making predictions but that for us has been a business that has continued to show signs of good health throughout 2008 and last quarter. \nRobert A. Iger: Regarding ESPN, on the program strengthening side, or the reference to the comment that I made, first of all it\u2019s in the best interest of anyone selling programming out there to publicize the fact that ESPN might be interested. But my comment was meant to say that in a tough economy, the strong -- from a brand perspective and a business perspective, and the business model at ESPN is obviously quite sound, have a tendency to improve their competitive advantage. And I think it\u2019s possible that the competition for programming that ESPN has faced could decrease somewhat in this tougher environment. That\u2019s what I mean.  In terms of your question about where we are with affiliate fees, as you know, those fees were going to moderate over time to the mid-single-digits. I think you can figure out based on the timeline where we might be in that moderation scale but we are not going to get specific about our program -- our subscriber increases. \nJessica Reif-Cohen - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. \nLowell Singer: Thank you, Jessica. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet of Citi.\nJason Bazinet - Citigroup: Thanks so much. Now that we are sort of in the midst of this economic downdraft, I am sort of more curious about the potential turnaround and given the investments that you have made over the past three years, I\u2019m thinking California Adventure, the videogame investments and the two new cruise ships, can you just remind us sort of in broad terms how you sort of imagine those coming online and helping the top line? Thanks. \nThomas O. Staggs: Well, we haven\u2019t given guidance or projections on what they would exactly do to the top line. The California Adventure, we are beginning the process of that construction. We actually -- the first piece of it has come online in Midway Mania, the Toy Story attraction that\u2019s there at California Adventure, but there is more to do and through 2010, 2011, 2012, and I think that having an evolving entertainment offering there should actually do a couple of things. One, I think it can drive the overall top line of the Disneyland resort. Number two, I think it could provide for the potential increase in length of stay as California Adventure becomes a bigger, more important piece of the vacation experience down there at Disneyland.  With regard to the cruise business, we have said in the past that we enjoy sort of a mid-teens return on invested capital in cruise and that we anticipated having a similar sort of return for the business after the two new cruise ships come online. That doesn\u2019t happen for a few years but the increase in the top line will be commensurate with that, so we are looking forward to that down the road. \nRobert A. Iger: I was at Disneyland and California Adventure on Sunday, in the middle of this tough economy on a day that started with rain in Southern California and there were 50,000 people at Disneyland and California Adventure combined for the day, which is -- I know that doesn\u2019t help because you don\u2019t have much perspective but that\u2019s a pretty strong showing.  And one of the things that was clear is that at California Adventure, where we\u2019ve got good attractions, a new one, Toy Story Mania, for instance, there\u2019s real appeal and real demand. We have an opportunity there because of the size of that property to infuse it with stronger attractions and I believe end up with a park that is substantially more successful than the one that we have today. And as Tom referenced it, because Disneyland itself is so built out, the primary way to really grow that resort is by improving California Adventure and growing that out. And when you consider that what we are putting in there is so attractive, Cars Land will be the anchor, a very, very successful franchise for the company, then we believe not only will we grow the top line but our real focus is to grow the bottom line and to grow our returns on invested capital.  Where we have committed to spending capital in 2009 and beyond, in each case the goal is to do just that, is to improve not just the top line but return on invested capital in the bottom line.  Another example of that would be the Disney Vacation Club where we\u2019ve added two very, very attractive properties to that mix -- the contemporary resort tower, which has a different name, and I can\u2019t remember at the moment --  [Multiple Speakers]  -- and Animal Kingdom, and an Animal Kingdom build-out and both properties are considered quite attractive to the marketplace, which is one of the reasons why we are getting the sales that we are getting. Again, another example of using capital to drive the bottom line. \nJason Bazinet - Citigroup: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Okay, Jason, thanks. Operator, we have time for one more question. \nOperator: Okay, your last question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente of Barclays Capital. \nAnthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital: Thank you. Focusing on the U.S. consumer on the demand side, if you look at October, Visa, MasterCard, AMEX, they all talked about how spending on credit cards contracted during the month and as a result, what they have decided to do here in November is lower maximum credit limits across the board, even for high-end consumers. So it would just seem like the average consumer just doesn\u2019t have the liquidity regardless of pricing on perhaps bookings at the theme parks.  Now, in the last recession you managed through, you didn\u2019t really have that liquidity issue but you did have terrorist fears, which you don\u2019t have now, at least, thank God, not to as high of a degree as you had last time. So I just clearly no two downturns are the same but Bob and Tom, I just hope based on your experience, can you help us compare on the demand side from the standpoint of Joe the plumber, so to speak, how those two different calamities compare? Thank you. \nRobert A. Iger: Wow, a political reference, Joe the plumber -- a distant memory [at this point]. I think you\u2019ve said it, you said it well, Anthony, when you said that no two downturns or no two recessions or no two economies are the same. Not only is the environment different but we are very different as a company too, as Tom pointed out well earlier. We are more affordable today, so you could argue if this -- if there are capital constraints, well, we are more accessible and more affordable. We have more value-priced rooms. That\u2019s certainly the case versus \u201991 and it is the case versus 2001 as well. So I don\u2019t think we can in any way really determine exactly how the downturn that we are currently experiencing will impact us except to give you the perspective that we gave you today, which is what we are seeing today. We are very purposeful in giving you as much detail as we could about the marketplace that we are seeing, but the reason for that is because we really feel that we can\u2019t really give you anything more than that right now, and I think that\u2019s a consistent theme that you are hearing across multiple sectors from multiple companies. It\u2019s just too tough to tell.  The thing that I feel the best about right now is the strength of the Disney brand, the mix of our assets, the creative momentum that we\u2019ve had, and the experience of our team that has been through if not the same kind of downturn, certainly a significant downturn before and we are better prepared to manage through this today than we were in 2001. \nThomas O. Staggs: You know, and it may sound odd but the fact is that given what Bob just said, we are in a position both with financial strength and business strength to be able to focus on the long-term and to focus on continuing to deliver value over time, and so while we will operate in this environment, from the standpoint of either the intrinsic value of the company or the long-term prospects of the company, we still feel very, very good about where we stand, and so the downturn will unfold however it will unfold but at the end of the day, I think we\u2019ve got a very good shot of seeing ourselves on the other side in an even stronger position than where we go in. \nAnthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital: Great. Thank you very much. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, Anthony. Thanks again, everyone, for joining us today.

Today\u2019s call will also be webcast and that webcast will be available on our website. And after the call, a replay and a transcript of today\u2019s remarks will also be available on our website.  Joining me in Burbank for today\u2019s call are Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tom Staggs, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob and Tom will lead off with some brief comments and then, on the off chance that you have any questions, we will be happy to take them. I will then read the Safe Harbor provisions.  So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob and we will get started. \nRobert A. Iger: Thank you, Lowell. We\u2019ve had another solid quarter fuelled by great creative momentum and the trust consumer have that our brands will deliver a consistently high quality entertainment experience. These attributes are incredibly important and incredibly valuable in an uncertain global economic environment and we believe they position us well to manage through undeniably turbulent times.  Like all companies, we aren\u2019t immune to the challenging economy but we continue to be pleased with the level of business activity we\u2019ve seen so far and especially with our long-term market position. We have an agile, experienced management team, a clear strategic vision for maximizing returns across our various businesses, and an unbeatable portfolio of creative assets.  In the eyes of the global consumers, our brands have never been stronger or more relevant. We have, in other words, a pretty good hand in a very tough game.  That said, we remain watchful and are committed to take the steps necessary to keep our businesses and our market position strong and to do so decisively. Our continued success depends on superb creativity and since we last talked, there have been several highlights that underline the breadth of the creative engines now at work at Disney. WALL\u2022E is a big hit, generating nearly $200 million at the domestic box office so far and in a testament to its quality, has been the best reviewed movie of the year, animated or otherwise. We believe WALL\u2022E will continue to provide substantial value over time as one of our classic films.  Disney Channel\u2019s Camp Rock has generated huge excitement among kids, [sparring] near record breaking cable ratings and online traffic. ESPN\u2019s coverage of the NBA Finals was a huge success, attracting great viewer numbers across multiple platforms with a classic match-up. And Toy Story Mania, which opened in June, has received great reviews as a cutting edge attraction that brings the incredible skills of our Imagineers to bear on a great Pixar story. Tom will go into more detail in a moment but our park performance during the quarter was particularly noteworthy considering the environment.  The content produced by Disney, ESPN, and ABC, irrespective of whether it is at our parks, on television, on the movie screen or on the Internet stands tall in a field of ever-increasing choice and the examples I just cited share several attributes. They are high in quality, relevant, identified with our brands, and priced in time attractively across platforms and markets.  In the coming months, we have more great entertainment on the way. We expect our fall release, High School Musical 3: Senior Year, to sustain what\u2019s become a fantastic global franchise for this company, while Bolt is a terrifically funny new Disney Animated film. Both Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers have new records and other great new projects in the works, and we\u2019ll soon launch an enhanced version of Disney.com, making even more compelling a rich, event-filled family entertainment site that drew a record 30 million unique visitors in June.  Our continued success validates our strategy of creating dependable, Disney-branded franchises that can be leveraged across all of our lines of businesses and adapted to maximize their relevance to local markets around the world.  By taking this approach, we build a broader and more stable base of earnings while increasing the financial returns from our creative successes.  That\u2019s the bottom line of the Disney difference -- more than any other media company, we are able to successfully and consistently create multiple experiences and products out of our creative properties in ways that generate consumer enthusiasm and real shareholder value.  And with that, I will turn things over to Tom. \nThomas O. Staggs: Thank you, Bob and good afternoon, everyone. As Bob indicated, we are pleased with how well our businesses continued to perform this quarter. At our media segment, our cable networks delivered double-digit increases in revenue and operating income, ESPN led the way once again with higher subscriber fees and low double-digit percentage gains in advertising revenue.  Ratings on the ESPN network also were up double-digit percentages versus our prior Q3, boosted by the NBA play-offs and the first two rounds of the Masters and U.S. Open golf tournaments.  ESPN deferred approximately $65 million more in affiliate revenue in the first half of fiscal 2008 compared to last year. In Q3, we recognized about $30 million of this incremental deferred revenue and we expect to recognize the remainder in Q4.  Disney Channel benefited from subscriber growth in key international markets and the network\u2019s successful programming is helping to fuel demand for the Disney brand around the world.  Broadcasting revenue was flat for the quarter while operating income decreased, primarily driven by lower results at our local television stations and higher amortization costs on shows in syndication.  At our television stations, advertising revenue decreased by mid-single-digit percentages compared to Q3 of 2007, principally due to softness in the automotive category. At the same time, we\u2019re extremely pleased with our station management team\u2019s performance. Eight of our 10 stations are number on in their markets and they have gained market share in the face of a tough environment.  At the ABC Network, lower primetime ratings were more than offset by strong ad pricing and lower programming costs. The lower programming costs in the quarter were in large measure the result of timing shifts for pilot and other development costs due to the WGA strike. This timing benefit will reverse in fiscal Q4.  While ad revenues reflected softer ratings, scatter CPMs in Q3 remained above up-front pricing by strong double-digit percentages, driven again by tight supply in the market. Thus far in Q4, scatter pricing is again well ahead of the up-front.  The pace of advertising sales has slowed somewhat in recent weeks at the TV stations and, to a lesser extent, at ESPN and the ABC Television Network, driven primarily by softness in the domestic auto, financial services, and consumer electronic categories.  As Bob mentioned, parks and resorts had a solid quarter, especially in light of the tough environment, as compared to last year\u2019s record Q3 performance. These results reflected slightly lower attendance at our domestic parks, which were affected by the timing of the Easter holiday falling in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and in the second quarter this year.  The impact of lower attendance was more than offset by higher corporate alliance income and increased guest spending at Walt Disney World. We estimate that without the impact of the Easter timing shift, combined attendance at our domestic parks in Q3 would have been ahead of prior year by lower single-digit percentages. As you might guess, international visitation was our strongest guest segment compared to the prior year quarter.  Per capita spending at Walt Disney World was up 3% versus Q3 2007, driven by higher average admission prices, while spending at Disneyland was 2% lower than last year.  At our Florida resorts, hotel occupancy remained strong, coming in at 92%, only about one percentage point below last year, and per room spending was on par with last year.  At Disneyland, occupancies were 91%. Although that figure is just about five percentage points lower than last year, per room spending in California was up by 5%, driven by gains in average room rates.  Looking ahead, current room reservations at our domestic resorts are virtually on par with prior year for the September quarter, and modestly ahead of last year for the December quarter.  Studio entertainment revenue and operating income were lower in the third quarter due to the performance of Prince Caspian compared to Pirates 3 last year, but as Bob mentioned, we\u2019re pleased with the performance of WALL\u2022E, which continues its strong rollout around the world.  At consumer products, earned licensing royalties grew by double-digits compared to the prior Q3, driven by continued strength across our many licensing categories as we leverage our broad base of licensed franchises.  The strong growth in licensing was offset by a decline in our home video game business, as games based on Prince Caspian did not measure up to the strength of those based on Pirates 3 last year. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, we believe we have significant growth potential in videogames and have continued to ramp up our development spending. This increased spending also impacted the quarter\u2019s results.  Revenue growth in margins at consumer products reflected our acquisition of the Disney Stores North America in Q3. In total, our Disney Stores business accounted for nearly $90 million in increased revenues, but did not meaningfully impact segment operating income.  We expect that our re-acquisition of the stores will modestly reduce profits at consumer products for the balance of this year. We have now reduced our number of stores in North America to our target footprint of about 225 locations.  The strength of our business enables us to maintain a strong balance sheet, even while we invest in growth opportunities we believe can generate strong returns. At the same time, we continue to return significant capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. So far this fiscal year, we have purchased 114 million shares for roughly $3.6 billion.  We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet, our cash flow, and the long-term outlook for our company and as a result, we expect to continue to repurchase shares going forward.  Our results demonstrate this company\u2019s ability to manage creative assets with financial discipline even in uncertain times. More importantly, the power of our brand, our diversified franchise portfolio, our creative strength and integrated approach we take to managing our businesses position us well to grow our earnings over time and deliver long-term shareholder value.  With that, I will turn the call over to Lowell for Q&A. \nLowell Singer: Okay, Operator, we are ready to take the first question. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from the line of Jason Bazinet from Citigroup. Please proceed. \nJason Bazinet - Citigroup: I just had one quick question on CapEx at the parks. I think you said in the past it should run about $1 billion a year. It seems like it\u2019s running a little bit below that and I was just wondering -- do you expect that to ramp up in the remaining quarter of the fiscal or do you think you are going to come in below sort of the long run average? Thanks. \nThomas O. Staggs: We had said traditionally or historically, we had said that we had targeted capital expenditures for the domestic parks below $1 billion. Not that long ago after we talked about ramping up our investment in California Adventure, investing in cruise ships, et cetera, Jay [Rizulo] had made some comments where he said that this year, we would indeed be below $1 billion in capital expenditures but that over time as we got into those investments, we would see years that would be somewhat above that bogey. But of course, as we mentioned in the past, we\u2019re actually very excited about those investments and think they are going to drive strong returns, so we\u2019re happy to put the money in that direction. \nJason Bazinet - Citigroup: But you think it will happen in fiscal \u201909?\nThomas O. Staggs: We haven\u2019t made any predictions for capital spending in \u201909. \nJason Bazinet - Citigroup: Okay. Thank you. \nLowell Singer: Okay, thanks, Jason. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Lehman Brothers.\nAnthony DiClemente - Lehman Brothers: Thanks for taking the question. A question for Bob; Bob, your operating environment where you are seeing fragmentation of media content and increasing difficult monetizing some of that content in a digital world, in many cases that creates inherent conflict of interest between content and distribution, so my question is are your interests aligned with those of Steve Jobs who is the single largest shareholder? And can you just help us with a couple of examples of how you and Steve are internally negotiating the balance between the interest of content and the interest of distribution? Thanks. \nRobert A. Iger: The decisions the Walt Disney Company makes in terms of how to distribute its content, how to price its content, and when to distribute its content are made solely by the management of the Walt Disney Company and are not determined or even influenced by any other outside entities, including Steve.  The decisions that we\u2019ve made in terms of where, when, how we have distributed content digitally have been made by us and in some cases made at a time that pre-dated the purchase of Pixar and the presence of Steve as a board member and as a shareholder.  I happen to believe and my senior management team agrees with me that in a world where more and more people are migrating online or to their computer to access both information and entertainment, that the Walt Disney Company would be served well by having a very strong presence in that environment. And in fact, our results to date have proved that having that presence has actually created benefits, both in terms of brand value, relevance, relatability, as well as the bottom line. Witness the fact that since we decided to put movies on the iTunes platform, we\u2019ve sold around 5 million movies, which we believe is largely incremental to what I\u2019ll call the after market movie business; that is, after its theatrical release.  I happen to believe that unless we occupy space in those platforms, the company will be, and other companies in the traditional media space, will be marginalized. So I think that what we have been doing from a strategic perspective and from a bottom line perspective is absolutely the right thing and I also believe that our ability to monetize will become more and more evident, because what you are seeing is you are seeing expansion of the marketplace, meaning you are seeing an increase in consumption. And actually, we\u2019ve managed to maintain margins that we feel quite comfortable with but I think focusing on margins is not necessarily the only thing that you should focus on. The fact of the matter is consumption is increasing. We\u2019ve seen that at ABC where access to programs has never been greater and therefore consumption of programs is greater. I don\u2019t think we\u2019d be getting as much consumption of the ABC television programs if the only place you could see them was on the ABC Television Network.  So while I admit that monetization against basically specific consumption is still somewhat an open question in terms of just how much, how far, how deep we\u2019ll be able to go, I actually think that we\u2019ve been driving incremental revenue. And again, I want to emphasize the fact that we have no conflict of interest evident in this company at all and the decisions that we\u2019ve been making, we\u2019ve been making solely for the benefit of the shareholders of the Walt Disney Company and the long-term value that we are aiming to create. \nAnthony DiClemente - Lehman Brothers: Thank you. I appreciate the answer. Thanks for taking my question. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, Anthony. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.\nDoug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank: Thanks very much. So my question is on theme parks. I think hotel bookings flat for September quarter and then up for the December quarter is pretty remarkable with the economic backdrop, with gas prices rising, with what\u2019s happening with airlines. Can you just walk us through why you think your pacings are still holding up so well in this environment, and how long that can be sustained? Thanks. \nRobert A. Iger: Well, it starts with the fact that we have a product that is very, very attractive, clearly, and we\u2019ve felt for a long time that the family vacation is still something that\u2019s considered quite valuable or significant, not just to domestic families but to international families. And I think we have a competitive advantage as well in that the experience that you can expect to have when you visit a Disney park is unlike any that you\u2019d experience elsewhere, and in some cases unlike anything you\u2019d experience in the entire vacation space. So I think it starts with that.  I happen to believe that our brand has strengthened over time and that\u2019s due to increased quality and just increased creative success. The presence of Hannah Montana, High School Musical, the growing of presence of Pixar, for instance, in our parks, the heightened relevance of Pirates of the Caribbean since the three movies were released, another example of that.  And I think brand perception goes a long way in terms of the appeal and the sustainability of the Disney park and resort experience, and I also believe that we\u2019ve taken steps over time, and it\u2019s a fairly significant amount of time, to make the product more accessible and more affordable.  Seventy-four percent of our rooms in Orlando are either value priced or moderately priced, and that makes that experience much more accessible to more people, even in these more challenging times. And we also have done a number of things, as you know, because we\u2019ve highlighted them over time to create family packages where a family of four can visit the parks under relatively affordable circumstances for basically a week\u2019s period of time. The price has been $1600 for that package without transportation. That\u2019s pretty affordable, as far as we see it.  So we think they have all combined to enable us to weather the store much better than others, much better than some have expected we could, and much better than we were able to in the past. \nDoug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank: Great. Thank you very much. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, Doug. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Mark Wienkes from Goldman Sachs.\nMark Wienkes - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. I\u2019m just wondering, could you talk to some of the levers you have with respect to the variable costs at the parks? We\u2019ve heard some chatter about maybe reducing the number of nights fireworks are displayed, et cetera. Sort to given that this economic slowdown didn\u2019t really sneak up on anyone, how much leeway do you have with respect to attendance pressure should it arise to be able to sustain the margins and the experience for the guests?\nThomas O. Staggs: I think the first thing to know is that the parks will set the schedule for things like fireworks and shows, park hours, et cetera, based on where demand is, what time of -- what season of the year and the inherent seasonality in the parks business, et cetera, with the fundamental goal of making sure that first and foremost, they are delivering the great guest experience that Bob referenced in the previous question.  Having said that, to the extent that there is a need to adjust to demand in that way, it\u2019s everything from show times to park operating hours to number of shows in a day to the number of carts selling food and beverage in the park. So there are a number of levers they can go to. We\u2019re quick to add that there\u2019s a high fixed cost component to our parks business. There\u2019s no question about that. But we\u2019ve got an extraordinarily experience parks team and they are very good on the one hand at yield management, as you\u2019ve seen in the strong results that have been posted so far, and they are quite good at monitoring the cost side and striking that proper balance between maintaining great guest experience and optimizing their cost base. So there\u2019s levers they can pull. Some are easier to pull at different times of the year than others. So if we are in the middle of a true peak season, you won\u2019t see much change in that regard because the parks will be quite full, and that of course has been our experience thus far this summer. \nMark Wienkes - Goldman Sachs: Understood. That\u2019s great. Thank you. \nLowell Singer: Thank you, Mark. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Benjamin Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Thanks for the question. I\u2019ll ask two, one is just a point of clarification, Tom, on the park side; corporate alliance income, could you just give us a sense of order of magnitude there and a little more color on what drove that in the quarter? And then on the advertising front, strong results at ESPN again. Obviously the ratings have been very good there. Any sense at this point on up-front commitments turning into orders towards the -- as we get into the fall? I think everyone is nervous about national ad spend. You\u2019ve got some auto exposure at ESPN. We\u2019ve heard all the noise on that front. Just what your sense is for your big advertisers on ABC, ESPN, as we head into the back half of the calendar year. \nThomas O. Staggs: Sure. On the second question, as you know, we were quite pleased with the up-front at ABC, mid- to high-single-digit CPM increases and really a good response to the schedule overall. And to date, I haven\u2019t heard anything that would give us pause to think that that wasn\u2019t as strong enough as we thought it would be or that something has changed with regard to the nature of the orders or the intention of the folks who have placed those orders, so we feel good about the up-front from that standpoint.  The corporate alliance income, I think the best way to think about that is that if you take a look at -- of course, we have corporate alliance income every quarter. The fact is that there was some that we mentioned in the release this quarter having to do with renewal of certain contracts that caused revenue recognition to be accelerated into the quarter and therefore was less of a recurring number than sort of the normal activity. And so if you look through that and a couple of the other more unusual items, I think the best way to look at the parks\u2019 results is that that pretty much cancelled out the economic effect of Easter, and so you can read the parks\u2019 results pretty well on their face in that regard.  We highlight the attendance impact of Easter in the comments just to get a sense of those trends but from the standpoint of the strong economic results you saw at the parks, those actually stand up to scrutiny pretty well.  I think you asked about the ESPN up-front. Again, here again we were pleased, mid- to high-single-digit CPM increases and good volumes of activity, so there we feel quite good. \nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Thanks a lot. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, Ben. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Michael Morris from UBS.\nMichael Morris - UBS: Thank you. Following up on the comment at the parks regarding the advance bookings, can you give us a sense of the magnitude of how much of total attendance would be booked at this point for September and December? I don\u2019t know if you can get specific, or at least give a feel for how much of that booking you already have.  And then second, on the revenue side at the parks, can you talk a little bit about how you would view the use of promotions or price cutting relative to any weakness in travel trends, or whether you feel that -- is it more important to keep pricing steady if there\u2019s weakness in demand, or would you consider promotions in the face of that? Thanks. \nRobert A. Iger: Well, I\u2019ll take the second part of the question, Michael. You know, we typically in what we\u2019ll consider to be shoulder periods or off-peak periods do some discounting. There are a number of weeks during the year that we do that and in the period that we talked about, which is the current quarter and the first quarter, there isn\u2019t anymore discounting going on then there was in the previous year, really. So the pattern that we see in terms of our bookings are not being impacted by greater discounting. We don\u2019t really break down when we talk about our bookings what percentage those bookings would represent of what we expect our total attendance to be. It\u2019s just not something we do. We know how many room nights we have on the books versus last year and when we make our comparisons to last year, that\u2019s what we base the comparisons on but we don\u2019t project what percentage of our expected attendance those represent. I think you can expect though, because we are already well into the quarter, that when we talk about a quarter that is roughly on par with last year from a bookings perspective that we\u2019re well into the quarter in terms of the percentage that those bookings would represent of our total attendance. And the first quarter -- \nThomas O. Staggs: Yeah, I would say the same for the first fiscal quarter, only because it\u2019s an important holiday season and people tend to plan that and book that in advance. So there is a meaningful percentage of total occupancy on the books at this point, so it\u2019s a reasonably good indicator of where at least things stand today. \nRobert A. Iger: Going back to your question about discounting, how important is the whole prices versus I guess attracting more people, as we\u2019ve mentioned a number of times, we have a very sophisticated revenue management or yield management system for trading -- basically it\u2019s a software program that essentially sells primarily our rooms, although we do now use it for some of our other businesses, and it makes millions of decisions in terms of rates based on demand.  And that system essentially is designed to maximize revenue and I think has done a very good job of that but as Tom, I think in your remarks you talked about -- I think -- did you talk about AVR in your remarks? Suggested that even with these bookings, we are experiencing actually a slight growth in our average daily rate, so it suggests that we are not discounting rooms. \nThomas O. Staggs: Pricing for rooms on the books at this point are at or above the prior year. It varies a little bit by the different category but taken as a whole, we\u2019re at or above the prior year into the pricing, so they are solid bookings and we feel good about where they stand. \nMichael Morris - UBS: Thank you. \nLowell Singer: Thank you, Mike. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Michael Nathanson from Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed. \nMichael Nathanson - Sanford C. Bernstein: Thanks. I have one for Tom and then one for Bob; Tom, could you talk about that cable network advertising? Clearly there are concerns about cable. You didn\u2019t see in the quarter but I wondered in the second quarter, how much of the growth at ESPN was coming from some of those events that, you know, Masters Open, Basketball that you mentioned? Was it a difference of footprint that may have driven the quarter versus last year?\nThomas O. Staggs: Sure. The bottom line is that the events themselves, the success of the NBA, for example, was a benefit in the quarter but not a huge benefit, and the reason for that is that much of that inventory, of course, is sold well in advance in one of the up-fronts that ESPN does. \nRobert A. Iger: Before we even know the teams or -- \nThomas O. Staggs: Before you know the teams, et cetera, and so -- \nRobert A. Iger: Or the number of games. \nThomas O. Staggs: Yeah. I\u2019m hopeful that the great success of the NBA Finals this year will bode well for the sale of the NBA play-offs for next year. I think that sets us up well but it didn\u2019t have a big impact economically for the quarter we just reported. \nMichael Nathanson - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay, and then for Bob, people are concerned about the high food cost inflation that you are seeing and I wondered if there\u2019s a strategy to pass on maybe some of the food costs in the parks and hotels and how do you deal with the strategy of price elasticity for food costs?\nRobert A. Iger: Well, first of all the cost of what I\u2019ll call commodities at our parks represents a very, very small percentage of the cost of our operations, under 5% -- actually, under 4%. So you\u2019re not talking about a big swing factor.  We are mindful of both the cost of the food to us and the cost that we pass on to our consumers. And based on some of the increases that we\u2019ve seen, which is in the 7% to 10% range for certain food commodities, we\u2019ve actually managed to deploy certain initiatives or strategies to mitigate that increased cost to us without having to pass it on to the consumer.  If it goes up significantly more, continues to go up on an continuing basis, I imagine at some point we\u2019ll have to pass that on but to date, we really haven\u2019t had to do that. \nThomas O. Staggs: If you look at Q3, food and beverage spending at both the parks and the hotels were up but they were only up by low single digit percentages, so just very modestly. \nMichael Nathanson - Sanford C. Bernstein: And fuel, too? Is fuel a large percentage of cost of goods sold?\nThomas O. Staggs: If you look just at the cruise line itself, fuel is an important part of their cost base. So if you looked at the cost of fuel for the cruise line for 2007 versus what we would expect it to be for all of 2008, we might be up as much as -- a little over $20 million in costs for fuel for the cruise line for the year.  And of course, that takes into account a pretty large increase in the cost of fuel, so we don\u2019t necessarily expect that increase to repeat itself. \nRobert A. Iger: There are also things that we do in terms of the way we operate that mitigate the increased expense. So for instance, on the cruise ships, we changed some itineraries. We actually vary our speed. We reduce our speed somewhat and we take other steps just to make the ships more fuel efficient -- a reduction in energy use would be one way to do that. \nThomas O. Staggs: Right, but for the rest of the parks operation, it again gets into a very small component of the overall cost base when you look at it that way. \nMichael Nathanson - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay. Thanks. \nLowell Singer: Okay, Michael, thank you. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Jessica Reif-Cohen from Merrill Lynch.\nJessica Reif-Cohen - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. I have two questions; can you size your music business for us? And do you participate in any of the concerts? And then the second question is on advertising, it sounds like it really markedly weakened in the last few weeks domestically. Can you discuss what you are seeing outside of the U.S.?\nRobert A. Iger: Well, I don\u2019t think we ever break out what our -- the bottom line of our music business is and we\u2019re not going to now. We manage it as part of the studio but the generation of hits or successes in the music business has come from a very synergistic or holistic approach to managing or leveraging this talent, from the Disney Channel to Radio Disney to Disney Records or Hollywood Records. It\u2019s obviously grown significantly over the last few years and has really turned into quite a nice success story for the company.  We do participate, by the way, in some of the concert successes, either in the form or royalties from licensing or the form of licensing talent to concert promoters. So The Jonas Brothers, for instance, was not our concert but we participated in the success and are participating in the success that\u2019s ongoing of that concert. And clearly with the way these properties are managed, Disney Channel, Radio Disney, Hollywood Records, Disney Records, the studio, we really believe that we\u2019ve created some momentum and have become much more of a magnet for talent as well because of our demonstrated ability to launch new acts and to maximize success from the older ones like Miley and the Jonas Brothers to High School Musical to a number of the newer ones that have been coming out.  And by the way, the Miley album was number one last week. We sold 371 million copies in the United States -- \nThomas O. Staggs: Thousand. \nRobert A. Iger: Thousand. \nThomas O. Staggs: Million would be nice.\nRobert A. Iger: Which is pretty strong. The second question was about the advertising, the recent softness, Jessica?\nJessica Reif-Cohen - Merrill Lynch: Yeah, if you could -- it sounds like the U.S. dramatically weakened in the last few weeks and I was just wondering if you could discuss what you are seeing outside the U.S.?\nRobert A. Iger: First of all, I wouldn\u2019t say dramatically. I\u2019d just say we\u2019ve noticed -- we\u2019ve detected weakness, as Tom said in his remarks, at our stations, at ESPN, and nationally the television network due to weakness in three key categories; U.S. automotive lead the way, particularly their impact on our stations and ESPN; financials and consumer electronics. I also want to emphasize the fact that advertising represents only about 20% of our revenue, so while we are exposed, we\u2019re less exposed than some of our peers in the media space.  Outside the United States, we have very little exposure to advertising and I\u2019m not aware that we\u2019ve really experienced any real weakness. \nThomas O. Staggs: I\u2019m not sure we participate broadly enough in advertising outside the U.S. to really give you a great gauge on that. \nRobert A. Iger: A few of the Disney Channels are advertiser supported -- the family channels, the [Jet X] channels in Europe are advertiser supported and there\u2019s a little bit of ESPN business that\u2019s advertiser supported but it\u2019s all relatively small and no one has made us aware that we are experiencing any weakness there. \nThomas O. Staggs: One note I\u2019d make just on the television stations is that it will be interest to see as the quarter and the first quarter next year develop because we have yet to see a lot of political ad money expressed at the local TV station level and I suspect it will be a bigger factor later in the quarter than it has been to date. How much of a factor, I couldn\u2019t say at this point. \nRobert A. Iger: And we\u2019ve also grown share in the local TV space, mostly because of the performance of our stations, which from a ratings perspective has been sensational. \nLowell Singer: Okay, thanks, Jessica. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Imran Khan from J.P. Morgan.\nImran Khan - J.P. Morgan: Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions; it seems like broadcast network audience overall declined again last season. Can you please talk about how you factored this into your programming spending for future, what impact would you see on ABC\u2019s profitability if the audience continues to decline? And the second question is related to theme parks. It seems like the airlines are trying to cut capacity in the fourth quarter and beyond. Can you give us some sense what kind of correlation airline capacity and theme park attendance may or may not have? Thank you. \nRobert A. Iger: On the airline capacity, the load factors into Orlando are still relatively low compared with some of the more popular destinations in the country, like Las Vegas, Honolulu, and pricing as well of flights to Orlando, while not necessarily the cheapest around are among the cheapest. And so there has been some reduction in capacity going into Orlando but not to a point where the load factors are actually even equal to or have exceeded what exists into some other destinations. And so for the visitor to a Disney park that wants to fly, and just under 50% of our visitors are flying, they typically book early and there\u2019s plenty of access for them to seats on planes. And it has not been a factor at all, nor do we envision in the near-term anyway that it will be a factor. Our guests only represent about 30% of basically the load factor of flights into Orlando, and again since they book early, it\u2019s not really an issue.  On the network cost side, one of the reasons why the ratings were down this past year was the writer\u2019s strike but in general, the way we\u2019re managing the network is, consider the fact that it continues to be a pretty challenging environment, particularly given the fact that it\u2019s a single revenue stream business, and therefore costs have to be addressed, both on the operational side and on the programming side. And I don\u2019t think that our costs from a programming perspective have been significantly reduced but they haven\u2019t significantly increased either, nor do I believe that there is really room in that business to do so.  But we\u2019re programming the network fairly aggressively on a 52-week basis and believe that the balance of cost and anticipated or expected revenue is enough to continue to drive profitability in that business. \nImran Khan - J.P. Morgan: Thank you, Bob. \nLowell Singer: Operator, next question. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer.\nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer: Thanks. Another question on broadcasting and one on consumer products; given that the results of the strike [enabled] production deals and then I assume we\u2019re going to re-cut them and looked at all of your program expenses, when you come into the fiscal fourth quarter next year, do you think you\u2019ve been able to reset some of the cost levels so we\u2019ll see better efficiency or more profitability at the broadcast level?  And then on the consumer products, you talked about how this quarter, margins were impacted by the Disney Stores and that will continue into the fourth quarter, and as well your investment spending in the gaming. Can you give us a sense for next year, can we expect profit growth out of the Disney Stores and if there\u2019s any comment on incremental investment spending on the videogames? Thanks. \nThomas O. Staggs: Sure. First of all, with broadcasting, I would largely reiterate what Bob said -- the efforts that they went through during the work stoppage and since then frankly have been about addressing the cost base and being prudent about it.  I wouldn\u2019t say to you that there\u2019s been a step function change, however, at all but on the margin, they are actually making sure that they are being as efficient as they can be, so therefore if you look a year out, I wouldn\u2019t encourage you to look for a step function change in the cost base or the cost of programming.  But again, it\u2019s an ongoing process and one that Dan Sweeney and Steve [Firson] and the rest of the team are all focused on day in and day out, and it\u2019s important to the future of the business. \nRobert A. Iger: They definitely took costs out of the system due to the writers\u2019 guild strike and are not going to put some of those costs, notably costs associated with long-term production, creative commitments, they don\u2019t intend to put those back into the system. \nThomas O. Staggs: Exactly, so -- and on the margin, that helps. \nRobert A. Iger: The second was the consumer products question, the stores. \nThomas O. Staggs: On consumer products, the bottom line is that we do -- as we mentioned, we expect the acquisition of stores to dampen profits to consumer products for the balance of the year but over time, we do expect the stores to be profitable. They overall bring the margin down and will continue to bring the margin down only because in the licensing business, the margins are extraordinarily high and being vertically integrated in specialty retail will naturally bring with it some lower margin dollars.  However, we think overall the stores can be a good economic proposition. We expect to earn decent returns there. I don\u2019t expect the stores, once we get them to more of a steady state level of profit to be a big driver of growth in the future. We don\u2019t anticipate meaningfully increasing the footprint of stores, but we do think that they are important touch points with consumers that can be managed in a way that overall is accretive to not just earnings but to the company and its brand as a whole.  Videogames, a little bit of a different story. We\u2019ve been ramping up spending. If I had to make a guess right now, I had been saying that we would get close to $200 million of development spending this year. They are running slightly below that pace right now, so it\u2019s probably more in the 180 to 190 range for the year in terms of development spending, given the pace that they are at at this moment.  We\u2019ll continue to ramp that up and over the next several years, we would look to get to something like $350 million a year in development spend as our investment in that business. And at that point, I think we\u2019ll have a nice critical mass and it will be contributing nicely to earnings. This year, videogames won\u2019t be a big driver of earnings one way or the other when you get down to the net bottom line, including that development spend. \nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer: Thank you. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, Jason. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Tuna Amobi from Standard & Poor\u2019s.\nTuna Amobi - Standard & Poor\u2019s: Thank you very much. My first question, I guess it\u2019s for Bob; I\u2019m a little bit surprised that the SAG situation is dragging on as long as it has, particularly given the progress that was made with the other unions. So given your unique perspective, what can you share with others to, you know, what\u2019s different in this particular situation and how soon do you think we might see a resolution and what plans you guys have made, particularly on the film side, to try to mitigate this situation? And separately for Tom, I wanted to ask about some of the newer franchises. I think I recall about a year or so ago, you gave the guidance for those three primetime shows and I was really -- I appreciated the outlook for about $1 billion for those three primetimes shows. So in that regard, in that manner, is it possible that perhaps you can quantify some of the newer franchises like Hannah Montana and High School Musical? How much in operating income do you expect some of those franchises to add to Disney across all platforms say over the next five years, perhaps including Jonas Brothers as well? That would be appreciated. \nRobert A. Iger: Well, on the SAG front, as you know the industry has done deals with the directors and the writers and with AFTRA and in all three cases, those deals included terms that dealt with some of the more difficult and more contentious issues related to new media. And with that, the industry put forward a very comprehensive proposal to SAG during the negotiation that essentially mirrored on the new media front the terms that the other guilds had already agreed to, as well as addressing a number of other issues that were relevant just to SAG on old media issues. And SAG did not see fit to accept those terms, particularly on the new media side, which we found to be somewhat unfortunate, given the fact that other guilds have been able to accept the same terms.  We find it difficult to offer to SAG terms that are different than those terms that the other guilds agreed to, and believe that the other terms that were offered were fair given the general circumstances and more than fair to this guild in particular.  And so the negotiation basically ended I guess a couple of weeks ago and to my knowledge, there hasn\u2019t been any real progress of any sort, or even attempted progress since then. So I don\u2019t really have a prediction in terms of either how this impasse might be broken or where things might go but I can say that by and large at this point, it\u2019s not having a particularly damaging impact on our business because we\u2019ve decided to continue to move forward with at least a number of our productions, and until such time as we feel that\u2019s not prudent, we\u2019re going to continue to basically approach our business in that way.  I don\u2019t think that there is any work stoppage imminent, by the way. I think it would be a very, very difficult thing for a guild in this environment to take on and probably rather unpopular as well, but I don\u2019t speak for that guild and I can\u2019t really predict what they are going to do, except that I think it would be unlikely that you will see another work stoppage in the near-term. \nThomas O. Staggs: With regard to television franchises, a couple of years ago we talked about shows created by ABC Studios and owned by the company and the pipeline of profits from those shows being sold in syndication and through other distribution windows. We talked about looking out over a five-year period or so and seeing $1 billion of profit potential.  If we look out today over a similar period of time for again ABC\u2019s stable of shows, we see a similar pipeline and similar profit potential -- that is, even though we\u2019ve enjoyed some of the profits referenced earlier, the pipeline has been sort of refueled to the point that we still think that there\u2019s a nice profit stream there for us in the future.  Now, with regard to the other franchises you referenced, really the ones that have come out of the Disney Channel, when High School Musical came about, there was a decent amount of confusion in the marketplace as to how we might generate profitability off a franchise that was created from a network that didn\u2019t charge advertising revenues and only charged affiliate fees, and so we talked, to help the market sort of size those types of opportunities -- by the way, High School Musical was clearly a phenomenon, was a great, great success and continues to be today, which shows the potential longevity of some of these franchises. But we talked about the fact that in the first year-and-a-half or so from its launch, it would generate a contribution of around $100 million in operating profit. We said earlier this year that we thought that High School Musical could contribute a similar amount in 2008 alone and that\u2019s still an accurate statement.  We haven\u2019t gone so far as to size each of the opportunities and talk about each franchise individually and I wouldn\u2019t do so today because the High School Musical example was to give an example.  What\u2019s really important to know is that what the Disney Channel is focused on doing is maintaining those franchises and having them be as long-lived as possible, like our other franchises, making sure that they are made available for all the other business units to capitalize on and they too then help extend their lives. But also to help develop a broad stable of those types of franchises so we continue to serve our audiences, both domestically and frankly internationally, because we talked a little bit about the importance of international Disney Channels in the quarter but also how important they are to our reach overall.  And so that\u2019s really sort of the business plan there in terms of those franchises, so they can be meaningful and they continue to be a big part of the game plan going forward. \nTuna Amobi - Standard & Poor\u2019s: Thank you. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, Tuna. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of David Miller from Caris & Company.\nDavid Miller - Caris & Company: Just housekeeping items -- Tom, if I assume that ESPN cable affiliate fee growth in the quarter was let\u2019s call it plus 9% and ad revenues in the quarter were plus 11%, would I be accurate? I don\u2019t think you gave specific [inaudible] on that, so if you can shed some color on that, that would be great.  And then Bob, I\u2019m curious about the per cap spending number at Disneyland being down 2% in the quarter, despite what looks to be very good hotel occupancy numbers during the quarter. Is that because Toy Story Mania at DCA opened in June and because maybe theoretically the sample visitor there throughout June might have been the local visitor, who tends to spend less? Or was there something else going on there? Thanks very much. \nThomas O. Staggs: Let\u2019s see -- on ESPN, I\u2019m not going to go into more detail on the individual growth rates than I went through in the prepared remarks. But I did talk about low double-digit gains in advertising revenue, so obviously that was a big contributor but affiliate fee growth is still an important and healthy part of ESPN\u2019s business overall.  With regard to the per capita spending at Disneyland, I wouldn\u2019t pin it on any one single factor. If you take a look at it, I don\u2019t believe it was driven by a preponderance of resident attendance. There was somewhat lower merchandise spending in the quarter. That probably has more to do with the tail end of the 50th anniversary last year and not being in that celebration this year than anything else, but to tell you the truth, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that was all of it either. But overall, I think that we are pleased with where the per caps came in as a whole and as you know, as I mentioned, we actually saw hotel spending up 5% in the quarter.  So I think all in all, still pretty solid numbers there but I would have a hard time pinning down for you any one single cause of the modest decline in per capita spending at Disneyland. \nDavid Miller - Caris & Company: Okay. Thank you. \nLowell Singer: Okay, thanks, Dave. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Rich Greenfield from Pali Capital.\nRich Greenfield - Pali Capital: A question related to theme parks in a few pieces: one, your ticket prices anniversary the increase this coming weekend. I was wondering if you could give us thoughts on how you think about pricing going into next year; two, the impact of Disney Vacation Club with a new Disney Vacation Club supposedly opening up shortly, or being opened up for sale next to the Contemporary Hotel; and then lastly, you commented I think, Tom, on the strength of international attendance at the theme parks. I was wondering if you could give a sense, if you look at some of the other pieces of attendance, how you are doing in terms of domestic fly-in, Florida resident, and non-Florida drive traffic to the parks, that would be great. Thanks. \nRobert A. Iger: Our decisions on pricing was -- you are correct in citing kind of an anniversary looming in terms of a potential price change, are largely based on price value relationship that we offer our customers and since we\u2019ve continued to invest nicely in the quality of the experience, the quality of the service, the quality of the entertainment attractions, we believe that we are delivering a significant value to our customers and I think that would be again the single greatest factor in our minds. To some extent, we also look at competitive circumstances and the competitive advantage that we have and we clearly believe that we haven\u2019t given up any ground in that regard.  Since we have not announced a change though, Rich, I\u2019m not going to get anymore specific than that but that\u2019s what we base the decision on, largely.  On the vacation clubs, the focus right now on the vacation clubs is in selling the Animal Kingdom property, both the conversion of the vacation clubs in the Animal Kingdom Hotel, as well as the additional vacation club units that we are creating in a new building structure adjacent to that hotel, and therefore the focus is on selling that and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve made no other announcements, nor have we put any other new vacation properties online, meaning for sale.  The third part of your question was regarding international attendance. \nThomas O. Staggs: Yeah, international attendance was stronger. The best way to probably look at domestic tourism trends is when we again try to isolate the Easter impact, domestic attendance would have been about on par with the prior year, having made that adjustment. If you left Easter in, domestic attendance would be down a little but because that\u2019s where Easter shows up the most. But if you correct for that, still solid attendance there, about on par with the prior year.  The percentage versus fly/drive, it hasn\u2019t shifted dramatically recently but as Bob said, it\u2019s a little under 50% that fly in right now, so we continue to watch the trends but I guess our overall message is so far, so good. \nRich Greenfield - Pali Capital: And could you just comment, DVC, what was the actual impact on earnings this quarter?\nThomas O. Staggs: The pace of sales at DVC was pretty much on par with the prior year, so DVC wasn\u2019t a big driver of change in the quarter but again, they had nice sales but they are about on par with the prior year. \nRich Greenfield - Pali Capital: Thanks. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, Rich. Operator, I think we have time for one more question. \nOperator: Your last question will come from the line of David Joyce with Miller Tabak & Company.\nDavid Joyce - Miller Tabak & Company: Thanks. Just a housekeeping question on the free cash flow -- is there anything unusual in the timing, maybe related to programming production that might be beneficial in later quarters?\nThomas O. Staggs: Let\u2019s see -- [I won\u2019t comment] about later quarters. You did see evidence this quarter, if you break it down. Obviously the cash flow statement in the press release is a nine-month statement, just by convention. But the quarter evidenced higher net investment in film and television, just driven mostly by live action, spending on live action films at the studio but that\u2019s really a timing issue more than anything else. And for the year as a whole, cash flow is in good shape, really driven by the higher earnings that we\u2019ve been showing. \nDavid Joyce - Miller Tabak & Company: Thank you. \nLowell Singer: Okay, thanks, David.

So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob and we\u2019ll get started. \nRobert A. Iger: Thanks, Lowell and good afternoon, everyone. We had an outstanding second quarter financially and creatively at The Walt Disney Company. Our diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations grew by an impressive 35%, putting our earnings per share in the first half of the year on par with what we delivered for all of fiscal 2005.  This performance demonstrates how the Disney difference gives us a critical and sustainable market advantage, and that difference centers on our proven ability to create high quality content, which benefits from Disney branding and from our wide-ranging distribution and promotional platforms.  In turn, we leverage that great content across our multiple businesses and across global markets, and I believe our creative pipeline has never been stronger.  In the coming weeks, we will be releasing two terrific Disney branded movies, Prince Caspian, the second instalment in The Chronicle of Narnia, and our latest animated film from Pixar, WALL\u2022E. While we don\u2019t normally give guidance, I am breaking my rule by politely guiding all of you to go see these two movies. I\u2019ve seen them both and they are great.  We are also tremendously enthusiastic about Disney Channel. At last weekend\u2019s Disney Channel games in Orlando, thousands of fans came out to enjoy a live performance by Miley Cyrus and other stars, and with a new season of shows coming up, a new record in July, and a theatrical film next year, the Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus franchise remains incredibly robust.  Rising stars The Jonas Brothers are another example of the Disney difference in action. The bad got great exposure on the Hannah Montana concert tour and subsequent 3D movie. That led to radio hits, a sold out U.S. concert tour, and a platinum CD. And next month they are starring in an original Disney Channel movie, Camp Rock, which premiers on four successive nights across four platforms -- the Disney Channel, ABC, ABC Family, and Disney.com. And next year, they will be in their own Disney Channel series and a 3D theatrical release.  Clearly we are managing our assets in an integrated way and leveraging success across businesses to create more value. Two years ago we acquired Pixar to regain our leadership position in animation and to show just how strong our animation pipeline has since become, we recently unveiled a slate of 10 new movies to be released through 2012. Five of these animated films support important existing Disney franchises -- Toy Story is set to open in 2010, following the 3D releases of the first two Toy Story movies; Cars 2 will premiere in 2012, building on the strength of our successful consumer products franchise, as well as the opening of Cars Land, a collection of exciting new attractions we are building at Disney\u2019s California Adventure. And from Rapunzel, Princess and the Frog, and Bear and the Bow, we are adding three new princesses to the ranks of the incredibly valuable Disney Princess franchise.  The last two films I mentioned, plus the remainder of the slate, are based on original ideas backed by an impressive array of producing and directing talent, and combining great storytelling with new technology has created huge value for us and these films are excellent examples of that principle.  That same combination is also the big idea behind Disney Nature, our first new Disney film label in 60 years. Over the next four years, we plan to release seven Disney Nature films theatrically. They will be supported across our entire company and we believe they can generate some exciting business opportunities.  We\u2019ve spoken a lot lately about the Disney difference but this integrated approach to managing our businesses applies equally to ESPN, which has created an impressive competitive advantage by leveraging great sports content across multiple platforms in order to provide fans with high quality coverage and information more broadly and deeply than anyone else in the business. As such, ESPN also creates enormous shareholder value. Last quarter\u2019s results certainly make that point -- ESPN network ratings were up by double-digits and whenever a big event comes to ESPN, its platform drives big results and that was certainly the case at the Masters where the Friday coverage of the Masters was the most viewed golf telecast in cable history.  Now let me conclude by talking about our parks and resort segment, since I know it\u2019s top of mind for many of you. Given the economic environment, we are pleased with the performance last quarter of our parks and resorts. And while I am not predicting future performance, I think there are several reasons why our parks have been so resilient to date.  The first is that our parks offer a unique experience that simply is not available elsewhere and we\u2019ve invested capital wisely from a creative perspective to make sure they continue to do so. We\u2019ve opened up some really thrilling new attractions and we\u2019ve taken advantage of our strong content pipeline across Disney to create new experiences for our guests.  In the last two years alone, we opened Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage at Disneyland, Tower of Terror at Disney Studios Paris and at Tokyo Disney C, and Expedition Everest at Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom. It\u2019s a Small World opened last week in Hong Kong Disneyland while Toy Story Mania will debut in the next six weeks at both Disney\u2019s California Adventure and Walt Disney World\u2019s Hollywood Studios.  Additionally, we are taking advantage of the creative success of our other parts of the company in our parks around the world. High School Musical is a perfect example. Shows and music and dance numbers from this great franchise can now be seen in our parks in the U.S., in France, and in Hong Kong.  We are also benefiting from new marketing and pricing strategies put into place over the last few years, enabling us to extend length of stay, serve more guests in on-property hotels, and grow revenues through sophisticated pricing initiatives.  Our investments in a world-class yield management system are really helping us to maximize our performance. Over the last several years, we\u2019ve made our parks more accessible to an even broader audience, adding significantly more value priced hotel rooms and creating vacation packages that allow a family of four to visit for seven days while staying six nights in one of our hotels for only $1600.  So we believe creativity, focused capital investment, and strategic pricing have helped to make us more resilient to economic downturns than in the past and our recent results are evidence of that. Our parks and resorts business remains unique and is a strong competitive advantage and we believe this segment can sustain success for years to come.  In summary, The Walt Disney Company clearly continues to thrive. We are intensely focused on our goals and believe nothing substitutes for quality when it comes to setting yourself consistently apart in the eyes of consumers. And I am very proud of where we are and where we are going, and with that, I will turn to Tom. \nThomas O. Staggs: Thank you, Bob and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another strong quarter with substantial growth in revenue, operating income, and earnings per share. We are also pleased with the overall pace of business across our various divisions.  At our media segment, cable networks delivered a double-digit increase in operating income. ESPN was again the key driver of our growth. They generated healthy gains in both affiliate fees and advertising, partially offset by higher marketing costs and sports rights fees, primarily for college basketball.  Bear in mind that for the first two quarters of fiscal 2008, ESPN deferred approximately $65 million more in affiliate revenue than in fiscal 2007. Based on our current expectations, certain programming commitments that ESPN reached in the third quarter last year will be met this year in the fourth fiscal quarter. On that basis, net revenue deferrals in Q3 of this year will be about $120 million greater than in last year\u2019s Q3. As such, we expect $185 million in net incremental deferred revenues for the year to be recognized in Q4.  As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, our Disney Channels and Disney branded programming slots are importantly daily touch points between consumers and the Disney brand at more than 130 countries worldwide. Here in the U.S., the Disney Channel ranked as the number two cable network in primetime last quarter. We continue to invest in Disney branded television programming, including locally produced content in key international markets.  Disney Channel\u2019s successful original programming, such as Hannah Montana and High School Musical continues to enhance revenues in our other business like consumer products and studio entertainment through merchandising, music sales, concerts, and theatrical releases.  At broadcasting, ABC\u2019s successful owned series, particularly Gray\u2019s Anatomy and Lost, sold well in international markets, which helped to drive strong growth in operating income despite lower advertising revenues at the ABC network.  Like most other broadcast networks, ABC\u2019s lineup included fewer original scripted shows during Q2, which contributed to lower ratings. The effect of this change was partially offset by primetime scatter CPMs for Q2 that were healthy double-digits above up-front levels, driven by strong demand and tight supply.  Thus far in Q3, we continue to see comparable strength in the scatter market. Fewer hours of new original scripted episodes in Q2 also lowered the network\u2019s programming costs in the quarter.  In Q3, we anticipate having fewer episodes of our own scripted series available for international sales as compared to Q3 last year and somewhat higher programming costs compared to the prior year as ABC studios will produce more original episodes of key primetime shows.  At our television stations, Q2 revenue and operating income came in modestly higher than in fiscal 2007. So far in Q3 ad sales in stations are pacing below prior year by mid-single-digit percentages.  Studio entertainment delivered an outstanding second quarter, with significant increases in both revenue and operating income, driven by the strong performance of our home video slate and theatrical releases.  In home video, titles like Enchanted, Game Plan, and best picture winner, No Country for Old Men, contributed to a 15% increase in units sold compared to Q2 of last year. We believe that our ratio of home video unit sales to box office revenues continues to outperform the industry average, especially for our Disney branded titles.  The studio\u2019s theatrical results improved due to both higher revenues from our new releases this year and higher marketing costs in last year\u2019s Q2 from Meet the Robinsons. This year\u2019s releases included National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets, which has delivered over $455 million in worldwide gross box office, 30% above the first quarter.  We also had great results from Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus 3D Concert movie, which generated over $65 million worldwide box office revenues in only 683 theaters. As importantly, the movie served to illustrate the exciting business opportunity offered by digital technology for both theater owners and film studios.  As we look ahead at studio entertainment, the key swing factors for the remainder of the year are Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian, opening in the U.S. on May 16th, and WALL\u2022E, which opens on June 27th. Bear in mind that last year\u2019s Q3 included the worldwide release of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World\u2019s End, whereas Prince Caspian, which is co-produced with Walden Media, will first be release in the U.S. in May and will roll out to international markets throughout the rest of the year.  Parks and resorts have once again delivered terrific growth in revenue and operating income on strong results at Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resort Paris. Attendance trends have been especially good at both our Paris and Hong Kong locations, each of which grew their attendance by double-digit percentages. We are also pleased with trends at our domestic parks for the quarter, where combined attendance was up 5% versus the prior year, with Walt Disney World attendance increasing 7% and Disneyland attendance coming in just above the prior year.  Of course, Easter fell in Q2 this year versus Q3 last year but even excluding our estimate of the Easter shift impact, combined attendance at our domestic parks was slightly ahead of prior year.  Attendance growth was driven by increased visitation from our domestic and international guest segments, with the higher percentage increase coming from international.  Per capita spending was also strong with growth of 3% at Walt Disney World and spending at Disneyland up by 8%.  At our Florida resorts, hotel occupancy was in line with prior year at 88% but higher average room rates and increased food and beverage spending helped us deliver a 7% year-over-year increase in per room spending. At Disneyland\u2019s resorts, a 16% increase in per room spending versus last year\u2019s Q2 more than offset some of the occupancy, which came in four percentage points below last year at 83%.  Parks and resorts also benefited in Q2 from the combined strength of our Disney Vacation Club business, in part due to successful sales of term extensions to existing DVC members.  While we won\u2019t predict how the remainder of the year will unfold, we are pleased with advanced bookings at our resorts so far. Room reservations for our domestic resorts for the rest of the fiscal year are currently slightly ahead of the prior year, with strength in Q4 more than offsetting a slight decrease in Q3. Pricing per reservation on the books for the balance of the year is also trending higher than prior year.  Bear in mind that the shift in the timing of Easter that helped Q2 will make comparisons somewhat more difficult in Q3.  At consumer products, we continue to deliver solid growth in earned royalties and licensing, driven by strong merchandise sales based on our hit tween properties, Hannah Montana and High School Musical. As expected, comparisons in Q2 for consumer products were impacted by the recognition of about $30 million more in minimum guarantees in Q2 of last year.  At Disney Interactive Studios, profit contribution from our self-published titles increased but was offset by reduced licensing revenues and higher product development expense. We expect to continue ramping up our development spending in the second half of the year, resulting in approximately $200 million in total videogame development costs for fiscal 2008.  As we announced, we\u2019ve just reacquired approximately 220 Disney retail stores. We are well aware of the challenges associated with this specialty retail business and we\u2019ve taken those challenges into account in moving ahead with this transaction.  As we transition back to owning and operating the stores, we expect their results to modestly reduce profits in consumer products for the balance of the year. Going forward, we believe we can generate an appropriate return on the relatively modest capital the stores will require.  At the same time, we think the stores provide us with an important direct touch point with some of Disney\u2019s best customers, giving us the ability to reinforce our brand, support our many franchises, and help us deepen our consumer relationships.  Our strong results have also fueled significant cash flow. Our first priority for our capital is to invest in future growth opportunities that can generate strong returns for our shareholders and we expect to find additional opportunities to invest internally or through acquisition to deliver profitable growth to our investors.  But our cash flow has also enabled us to return significant capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. So far this fiscal year, we have bought over 74 million shares for roughly $2.4 billion. Given our strong balance sheet and cash flow, we expect to continue to repurchase shares going forward.  Our recent performance reflects both our creative momentum and financial discipline. We remain focused on capitalizing on our strong brands, creative strength, and franchise portfolio to drive higher returns while allocating capital strategically to build sustainable growth.  With that, I will turn the call over to Lowell for Q&A. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, Tom. Operator, we\u2019ll be ready for the first question. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from the line of Jessica Reif-Cohen with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.\nJessica Reif-Cohen - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Bob, I was wondering if you could comment on your view of the potential of an actor\u2019s strike and what your plans are in that event. And also, if you could, one of you could comment on the impact of Blu-Ray in the quarter and expectations from that. \nRobert A. Iger: The AMPTP companies, the producers and SAG, representatives of SAG are actually meeting as we speak. And because the discussions have been ongoing, it wouldn\u2019t be right for me or anyone to characterize just how they are going, and nor do I really want to in any way either predict whether there will be another work stoppage and how we will react to it. Clearly the fact that we did deals with the writers and the directors should certainly signal our position on the critical issues and I think SAG is well aware of that and -- I guess I\u2019m better off probably not elaborating.  In terms of Blu-Ray, the penetration of Blu-Ray players is still relatively modest and while we\u2019ve got some titles out there, the real impact from Blu-Ray will be felt down the road. In fact, we\u2019ve got some exciting titles coming up, including Nemo and -- all of a sudden I forgot the name -- National Treasure, exactly in May and then later in the year we\u2019ve got Sleeping Beauty. Actually, Nemo is later in the year as well.  And we see penetration growing nicely, particularly as the cost of the players comes down. You\u2019ll be seeing a lot more $300 and less inventory in terms of player costs on the shelves.  We\u2019re believers because of the quality of the experience but it is going to take some time for the platform to penetrate the marketplace. \nThomas O. Staggs: I think for perspective, for a new release important title right now, you can easily see mid- to high-single-digit percentages of the units be Blu-Ray. Overall, total units are going to be probably more in the low-single-digit range because less Blu-Ray on catalog sales right now, but as Bob said, we think that\u2019s going to continue to grow and especially as you get passed the next holiday season, it can be a more important component of the whole thing. \nRobert A. Iger: And pricing as well is positive for us. The cost of the Blu-Ray DVD in the market or on the shelf to the consumer is running a few dollars higher -- actually, I guess it\u2019s as much as $5 higher than the standard def and that obviously bodes well for us, although as it penetrates the market, we\u2019ll see whether the pricing comes down. \nJessica Reif-Cohen - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, Jessica. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Yes, sir. Your next question is from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nDoug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank: Thanks very much. For Bob, Warner Brothers seems very excited about the prospect for day-and-date VOD. I know we\u2019ve been talking about this for a year now but with this actually starting, are you as bullish on the impact for your film business? And then for Tom, if I could also throw in there, when you talk about your pacings, are you also seeing the same impact where international seems to be helping the pacing numbers in the theme parks more than domestic, as you said happened in the March quarter? Thanks. \nRobert A. Iger: We\u2019ve been bullish about day-and-date digital delivery or other forms of delivery of our movies for quite a while, although we\u2019ve been in the marketplace with what was called an experiment with Comcast, and I have to say that the results -- well, they are kind of neither negative nor positive. They are not particularly conclusive. We don\u2019t seem to see any signs that sales of films in the day-and-date VOD window are having a negative impact and I\u2019d have to say that so far, they\u2019ve been mildly positive because although the sales have been modest, I think we see them as basically incremental to our current business.  But over the next five years, we think that you are going to see rollout of not only more films available through cable VOD but most of the other studios are joining us at Apple and selling movies on a day-and-date basis through that platform, and there will just be more ways that movies will be available and I think in general, that\u2019s going to be positive to our business.  The DVD or the sale of physical goods will continue to be important for a long time and will dominate the marketplace, and for Disney it is particularly important because we\u2019ve seen that families want to own the physical copies so that their kids can play it many, many more times and that\u2019s obviously a positive thing. But we also are in general quite positive about other forms of delivery. \nThomas O. Staggs: Doug, with regard to the visitation trends that we are seeing, as I mentioned the biggest percentage growth rate last quarter came from international, although the biggest absolute growth rate in terms of actual attendees is still domestic, given that\u2019s a larger portion of the attendee base.  I don\u2019t have any reason today to believe that trend will stop but I think that we need to get deeper into the summer season to really know for sure, as we get into the real vacation season.  I think that the weaker dollar has probably helped us some with international visitation. I think it also encourages domestic vacationers to stay closer to home and perhaps we are seeing the benefit of that. So we\u2019ll have to see as we go into the summer how that unfolds, but that\u2019s been the trend that we\u2019ve seen so far. \nDoug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank: Thank you. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, Doug. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Thanks a lot. If I could ask two, one on 3D; Bob, it\u2019s place that is natural for Disney to take a leadership position on 3D. I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about the impact on the average film costs -- all else being equal, how much does 3D add to the budget per film? And then on the revenue front, are your expectations down the road that you will price these differently at the theater or will the DVDs cost more or do you just think this is a pure just market share gainer for you relative to what else is out there once we are deeper into the 3D story?\nRobert A. Iger: The cost of producing a 3D movie for a live action film runs about 25% more than the typical cost, and for an animated film, it\u2019s significantly less than that -- actually, relatively modest. So we don\u2019t really view this as a cost issue.  We\u2019ve been believers in 3D for a while and probably have the most experience, particularly since we released the Miley Cyrus/Hannah Montana concert film. And so generally, we\u2019re bullish and one of the reasons that we\u2019re bullish is because we believe it gives us the ability to price higher but it also, because the experience is generally better, should bring more people to the movies. So we see it as a combination of factors. It\u2019s revenue from pricing and revenue from what I\u2019ll call greater attendance.  And if you followed the announcement that we made back last month about our animated films, after WALL\u2022E all of our animated films that we announced except Princess and the Frog will be in 3D. \nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Great. Thank you. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, Ben. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Michael Morris with UBS. Please proceed.  \nMichael Morris - UBS: Thank you. Just two things on broadcasting -- first of all, I know you mentioned this but maybe a little more detail; it seems like ratings drove the decline in revenue at broadcasting in the quarter. Now that you are back on the air with the programming, do you feel comfortable that the ABC Network revenue growth is kind of returning to the same level it was before? And then second of all, with respect to that impact to international syndication and perhaps on domestic syndication from having fewer programs in the pipeline from the writers\u2019 strike, are you back on track? Do you think that you are going to make those up in this timeframe or are those shows perhaps lost forever? How should we think about that going forward? Thank you.\nRobert A. Iger: The first one, we believe that from a revenue perspective and a ratings perspective, we\u2019re seeing a couple of positive trends. First of all, scatter pricing remains incredibly strong, up over 50% over the up-front, which was the case in the first quarter as well. We believe that dynamic bodes quite well for the up-front but in particular, ABC is very well-positioned for the up-front because it will return to its schedule an incredibly strong foundation of programs -- Desperate Housewives, Lost, Gray\u2019s Anatomy, to name a few, Dancing with the Stars. And those programs not only deliver really strong demographics 18 to 49, but over index in a higher income, higher education houses, or households. And that essentially puts us in a position for the up-front to grow CPMs.  And so we actually are going to the up-front feeling quite positive. I\u2019m not making predictions about the total marketplace or the depth of the marketplace but believe that going into the up-front, we are quite well-positioned.  So up-front combined with a strong scatter and the fact that ratings are returning to ABC since the work stoppage, we think we are in good shape revenue wise for the rest of the year. \nThomas O. Staggs: In terms of the episodes, in most cases we think that we will catch up and ultimately make as many episodes as we might otherwise have, but whether that\u2019s true for all of them remains to be seen. But I think that over time, we will more or less catch up. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, Mike. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Ingrid Chung with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. \nIngrid Chung - Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much. So the first question I have is on the Disney stores. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you are going to approach the management of those stores differently from the way you managed them before. Also, do you have the right amount of stores now? Do you need more or less? And what kind of capital investment are you planning for those stores?\nRobert A. Iger: Well, we are going to have a different management team. The team that led the stores years back is gone and it will be under new management but still under the leadership of Andy Mooney, who runs consumer products. But we will have new people running the stores.  In terms of the number of stores, we haven\u2019t really made a decision in terms of the exact number although in all likelihood, it will be fewer than we have today than more. And we are mostly going to be focused on improving location -- that is, location in market location, location within markets, location within malls.  At the same time, the initial focus is going to be on improving the quality of the merchandise and the quality of the service before we make any absolute decisions about capital investment. But Tom mentioned earlier that our capital investment will be modest and that\u2019s what we intend to do as we basically approach remodeling and redesigning these stores.  We think the most important thing right now, at least initially, is to get into the stores a higher quality of merchandise that better represents the great array of franchise product that the company now has, which we did not have when the stores left us some years ago. And when you look at the success of the shows that we\u2019ve talked about a lot during this call -- Jonas Brothers, Hannah Montana, High School Musical, plus the films, Cars and Narnia and Pirates, that\u2019s a far cry from where we were when we had the stores. And I think that the ability to basically tap those great franchises, combine with new management and more focus -- we had many more stores back then. We had well above 500. At one point we were well above 300 when we exited the business and now that we\u2019ve got roughly 220 or so and probably will end up going less, it will give us the ability to be more focused in general and basically take advantage of better locations in the marketplace. \nIngrid Chung - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thank you. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, Ingrid. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citigroup. Please proceed.\nJason Bazinet - Citigroup: I think it was a year or two ago you guys described an initiative to begin self-production of videogames as sort of slightly higher risk but potentially much greater return. I was just wondering if you could share with us any color and any early lessons thus far. \nThomas O. Staggs: Sure. It was a few years ago that we embarked on that initiative and as I mentioned, we will invest about $200 million this year in product development for self-published videogames. And we are finding what we expected to be true to be true -- very attractive returns on Disney branded titles, especially those titles that are based on some of the established and hit properties that we\u2019ve got being created throughout the rest of the company. And so we are very encouraged so far. We don\u2019t necessarily -- we\u2019re not announcing that we are all the way there. We think that we will continue to ramp up our spending, even as we try to build upon our creative capacity in this area. But as we look down the road a few years, we are quite hopeful that we will have created another vibrant creative center within the organization, still very heavily skewed towards Disney branded titles and skewed within the Disney brand towards properties that are established. And that I think is a very good formula for strong returns and attractive top of industry kind of margins if we continue to execute well. \nJason Bazinet - Citigroup: If you isolated that business today, would it generate cash today or it\u2019s still a few years out?\nThomas O. Staggs: Well, the reason today that it hovers around, for example, in 2008 it will not contribute meaningfully one way or the other in terms of the bottom line. We expense all product development as it is incurred and so here as we go forward, I am hopeful that we are at a bit of an inflection point and we will start to see both cash flow and profitability grow going forward. \nRobert A. Iger: Jason, I\u2019ll mention one more thing -- we\u2019ve seen in the last few years a demographic expansion among videogame consumers to basically include younger kids as well as more girls than we saw years back. And that\u2019s a great benefit to Disney and part of that is due to the success of the Nintendo platforms, both the DS and the Wii. So the Disney name, Disney brand and the products that we are essentially tapping into to make videogames are playing very well on these new platforms across demographics that we would have not seen three, four, five years ago. \nJason Bazinet - Citigroup: Very helpful. Thank you. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, Jason. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Rich Greenfield with Pali Capital, please proceed. \nRich Greenfield - Pali Capital: A couple of questions -- one, when you look at your theme park comments, Tom, it sounded like you were looking for tougher attendance trends in the third quarter. Just wondering, given the strength of your international parks, the strength of your in-park spending as well as the hotel gains year over year, is it still logical to expect revenues to actually be up in both the back half quarters? And then just on the Disney Channel, especially with the Jonas Brothers coming, it seems like you are monetizing this stuff through so many difference pieces of Disney -- what percentage of revenue actually comes from Disney Channel branded entities, just to get a feel for how important it is to the whole company? Thanks. \nThomas O. Staggs: With regard to your first question, I wanted to point out of course that we\u2019ve got that reversal of the Easter comparison in the third quarter and beyond that, we really don\u2019t want to make any predictions about what Q3 or Q4 are going to look like. I mentioned that on a combined basis, that bookings were slightly ahead of the prior year, although there is greater strength in Q4 than in Q3, as you might imaging, given that Easter shift.  But in terms of predicting revenues and that sort of thing, I don\u2019t -- that\u2019s further on guidance than we would typically go and I think we\u2019ll leave it at that. \nRobert A. Iger: We can say though that even though Easter shifted into the second quarter from the third, the first month of the new quarter was very strong at Disney World from an occupancy perspective -- over 95% and that\u2019s a good sign.  And I want to go back and elaborate a little bit more on some of the comments I made earlier, because clearly what -- there\u2019s a lot of attention on this segment for good reason and what I essentially said was we\u2019ve got great creativity, we\u2019ve invested in the right attractions, we put our capital in the right place. We are clearly leveraging other company franchises -- I mentioned the Disney Channel Games is a great example of that but High School Musical in Hong Kong is a perfect example of that.  We are definitely benefiting from the dollar weakness, as Tom mentioned, in two ways and then lastly these pricing strategies and marketing strategies have helped. We\u2019ve extended length of stay, which was a primary goal, we\u2019ve moved a lot more people off property on property. That\u2019s obviously a good thing.  When you look at the mix of our hotel rooms, we find this is also interesting and probably making us more resilient as well, and that is that we now have about 75% of our hotel rooms in Walt Disney World in the moderately priced or value-priced category. And when you look back at 1991 when there was a recession, over 55% of our rooms then were considered premium priced.  And so we have basically built out a portfolio of rooms that are more accessible to more people, to a broader section. Now, you are getting the same experience whether you are in a moderately priced or a value priced room or you are in a premium priced room -- you are still riding the same attractions and seeing the same shows and essentially the price/value relationship is probably considered a lot stronger than it was back then and we think all these factors are contributing nicely to the results that we\u2019ve seen.  And while Tom and I have both said a number of times we don\u2019t make predictions, we made a comment about the general bookings for the rest of the year, but I think what we are trying to say is while we don\u2019t know where the marketplace will take us, we believe we are much better positioned in a difficult economic cycle than we were in the past, certainly back in 1991. \nThomas O. Staggs: You asked about the revenues for Disney Channel properties around the company and while we don\u2019t break things out that way, clearly High School Musical and Hannah Montana in particular have been important drivers of our results, especially in the first and second quarters of this year. And we expect that they are going to continue to deliver for us. You mentioned the Jonas Brothers, that\u2019s coming on strong and I think as Bob mentioned in his remarks, the creative pipeline at the company and especially at Disney Channel feels very robust, so we think that those franchises can continue to deliver well into the future.  I mentioned at the beginning of the year that we expected that High School Musical, which had made about $100 million in operating profit contribution in its previous 18 months of life, that in fiscal 2008 it would exceed that and it\u2019s actually even exceeded our expectations from there. So it is a very strong contributor and along with the established properties, Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, Princess, Fairies is coming on -- we think we\u2019ve built a much broader base of business from these established Disney franchises and that base gives us a nice place to operate from in terms of driving continued good results and future results.\nRobert A. Iger: And it\u2019s also seen across a lot of our businesses, so it\u2019s obviously improved our studio, the Hannah Montana concert, the Jonas Brothers concert coming up, High School Musical 3 which comes out in October. I talked about it improving our parks, we\u2019ve talked about it improving licensing. We haven\u2019t mentioned today what it\u2019s done to our music business but we have grown a very healthy and robust music business that essentially continues to leverage itself in the sense that it\u2019s a more attractive place for new talent. And when you see Camp Rock, you\u2019ll see what we mean. We just have a collection of platforms that are basically feeding into one another to grow current talent, attract talent, and essentially impact all of the businesses. \nRich Greenfield - Pali Capital: Can you just give us a sense of that 95% you cited for April \u201908, what\u2019s the comparable to April \u201907 as just a way to think about up or down or flat?\nThomas O. Staggs: April last year had Easter in it. It was also a very high occupancy month and occupancy actually isn\u2019t the primary place that you see the effect of Easter. It\u2019s in actual attendance, and so I think that occupancy level, while comparable to last year, doesn\u2019t necessarily tell the whole store. \nRich Greenfield - Pali Capital: Thanks so much. \nLowell Singer: Okay, thanks, Rich. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: The next question is from Drew Borst with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.\nDrew Borst - Sanford C. Bernstein: Thanks. I have two questions on the parks. The first question, one of your competitors down in Orlando had mentioned that they had seen some weakness in March and despite Easter. I was wondering if you could just discuss some of the trends that you guys saw monthly during the quarter. That\u2019s the first question.  The second question, I was wondering, Tom, if you could share with us the impact of, you know, you mentioned the Disney Vacation Clubs were contributing nicely to revenue. I was wondering if you could just discuss how much that contributed to revenue growth and maybe also talk about the operating income impact. Thank you. \nThomas O. Staggs: With regard to trends in March, as you can see from the results, and given the timing of Spring Break, et cetera, it is impossible to have those results without having a strong March. I can\u2019t speak to what other people have experienced but we are obviously pleased with the pace of business that we saw in Q2 at our domestic parks, as well as our international parks.  With regard to Disney Vacation Club, this has become a very important business for us and one of the things that I think Bob has cited in talking about the resiliency of the business overall. And the -- so DVC did contribute to the revenue growth in the quarter. It wasn\u2019t the biggest driver of revenue growth but we did see an increase in DVC revenue. Similarly, it was a component of -- although not the biggest component on its own in terms of unit sales of operating income growth. We also had higher rentals of Disney Vacation Club units and that showed up in our results, although it doesn\u2019t come through as DVC. Obviously it\u2019s different than selling the units but we have units available for rent with the rest of our room inventory. That contributed.  I mentioned hat we had some term extensions at old Key West, which I think is a tribute to the product because this is really when we sell our vacation club memberships with defined terms and we\u2019ve had a nice response to offering to extend those terms for people that want to have that property for a longer period of time and perhaps pass that property down within the family, et cetera. And so this business continues to be a very nice driver for us and contributed nicely to our growth in the quarter. \nDrew Borst - Sanford C. Bernstein: Is there any way to -- I mean, your U.S. park revenue went up by $172 million when you strip out the royalties. I mean, is there any way to specifically quantify how much was from the vacation clubs?\nThomas O. Staggs: Yeah, I mean -- you should infer from my comments that it\u2019s well under a quarter of the revenue increase, or a under a quarter of the revenue increase in terms of revenues. We have nice profitability from our vacation club sales and so the profitability contribution was strong. But that\u2019s as much as we really break that business out.  By the way, one of the reasons is that what we do in the vacation club isn\u2019t on a quarter by quarter basis. It\u2019s going to have a fair amount to do with the inventory of units we have available for sale. So in other words, Saratoga Springs, which is now about 90% sold, we had less and less to sell there, whereas Animal Kingdom Lodge was ramping up in the quarter. So as we shift properties, quarter to quarter comparisons in the vacation club become a little bit tricky. When you look at it overall, this business has shown nice growth for us over the last several years and I suspect it will continue to contribute nicely going forward. \nDrew Borst - Sanford C. Bernstein: I\u2019m sorry, just one last point and I\u2019ll get off but in terms of the inventory that\u2019s coming online over the next couple of quarters, I mean, you\u2019ll continue to see a steady ramp?\nThomas O. Staggs: We\u2019ll continue to have inventory available. There isn\u2019t a substantial up-tick in inventory available necessarily in the next couple of quarters but we have new properties under development as you look forward over the coming years. \nDrew Borst - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, Drew. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nDavid Bank - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you. First off, I was wondering, kind of given where we are in the season, could you quantify where you think the primetime ratings actually are season to date? And could you help us get our arms around the core trends a little bit better? You know, there\u2019s a lot of moving parts here. You\u2019ve kind of got the C3 to live, plus seven, you\u2019ve got the WGA strike -- what do you think on a kind of live plus to live plus seven that the core trends are? And what do you think the strike took away? And then if I can, just a second question -- what percentage of the park or the hotel attendance and park business is attributable to business and convention visitors? And are those trends any different than the overall trends? Thanks very much. \nRobert A. Iger: I think there are too many apples to oranges comparisons ratings wise from this season to last, mostly because of the strike. And so citing a trend is difficult. We also have essentially a difference in terms of the way we are really measuring this.  The focus from a sales perspective is on commercial ratings plus three and that will largely be the focus going into the up-front, as it was last year. I think it\u2019s safe to say that the ratings were probably slightly down over where they were last year but then once the strike hit, that comparison was impossible. And they\u2019ve come back, although that\u2019s difficult as well because there are fewer people using television this time of the year because of daylight savings time and so it\u2019s difficult to compare the ratings post strike with pre strike for that reason.  As I said earlier, we think we are well-positioned in the marketplace and I think that\u2019s probably the best way to leave it.  In terms of the percentage of business and convention -- that business and convention business represents to the park, we don\u2019t break that out. We have a good business there. It\u2019s been a good business for quite a while and it continues to be. \nThomas O. Staggs: And in the quarter, there wasn\u2019t a meaningful change or shift in the amount of business and conventions attendance or resort activity that I would spike out as being a dramatic driver of the results in either direction. \nRobert A. Iger: It might have been slightly less only because Easter was there and there were fewer conventions going on because of the holiday season, but that would be the only change. \nThomas O. Staggs: Yeah, well we haven\u2019t seen a dramatic shift in that business \nLowell Singer: Thanks, David. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Alan Gould with Natixis, please proceed. \nAlan Gould - Natixis Bleichroeder: Thank you. You\u2019ve given us the scatter market. Could you give us some other ad trends -- what\u2019s happening at ESPN, what\u2019s happening at the local TV stations? And also, it seems to me there\u2019s a big difference between -- a big gap between local and national ad trends this year. Could you comment on that?\nThomas O. Staggs: We are up at ESPN quarter to date. It\u2019s been -- you know, a lot of this is supply driven but ESPN continues to see nice ad trends, sort of mid- to high-single-digits if you look over the last couple of weeks pacing over the prior year. The local TV stations I mentioned in the prepared remarks are down mid-single-digits or so versus the prior year -- again, that\u2019s been -- that\u2019s a little bit -- that\u2019s Q3 I\u2019m talking about. That\u2019s a little bit of a choppy market as well.  Q2 by the way, ESPN was more like up high-single-digits in ad sales. So we continue to see good strength there but we\u2019ve talked in the past about the fact that there is going to be a difference in the ad market between the network let\u2019s say and the strongest of the cable networks and perhaps others, so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s indicative of the cable market in general, although we\u2019ve seen reasonably good strength there.  On of the drivers of our growth last quarter, as an example, was Lifetime and A&E. They had nice advertising sales. So I think that the local versus national trend is one that we all keep our eyes on and our television station business though, there we\u2019ve managed to gain share pretty nicely over the last couple of years. We have an extraordinarily strong set of managers in our stations. They do a great job of capturing share but the -- we just have 10 stations. They are in the major markets and so I think they are a little bit better insulated from some of the trends in local that you might otherwise see. And in terms of the positioning of local stations, I think ours are in very, very good shape. \nAlan Gould - Natixis Bleichroeder: Tom, are you worried that some of the local industry trends are going to start affecting national advertising?\nThomas O. Staggs: Well I think that what you are seeing, for example, during the strike obviously supply was constrained in national advertising and the response was that rates went up dramatically. It didn\u2019t drive the advertising necessarily away from network television.  I think there is a unique context and a unique reach of network television that has yet to be matched by other media and I don\u2019t see it being matched any time soon. So I think that that is a unique buy. It\u2019s part of the reason that we think over time, although it\u2019s certainly not a growth business, the 10 major market stations that we have will also fair reasonably well because they again provide context and a reach in a strong, large local market that is hard to replicate.  So only time will tell but I think that we are reasonably well-positioned. \nAlan Gould - Natixis Bleichroeder: Okay. Thank you. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, Alan. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer, please proceed.\nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer: Thanks. Two questions -- first, just not to harp on the parks but is there anything you guys are thinking about doing to offer incentives for the summer months to help offset the high price of gas, as that seems it\u2019s going to get more focus in the press and politically? And then my second question, obviously this was a very strong studio growth quarter, particularly with margins and just the way it looks, it looks like you\u2019ll finish the year with record margins in the studio. How does that set you up for next year as far as creating more difficult comps, given the tight cost controls this year? Thanks. \nRobert A. Iger: We haven\u2019t seen any evidence that the increased price of gasoline is having an impact on our park attendance and so we don\u2019t believe there is any reason for us to consider any pricing strategies that are in any way tied to gasoline price increases. We still have a really strong business, as we\u2019ve said a few times, and it continues to grow nicely and we don\u2019t really -- we definitely have pricing strategies that reflect demand issues throughout the year but none that in any way reflect other things that are going on in the marketplace. \nThomas O. Staggs: With regard to the studio, I think it\u2019s important to remember that in the studio entertainment business, there\u2019s a piece of the business that get reinvented every year. That is fundamental to the strategy that we put in place to invest behind Disney branded films where we think there is a better chance of a return and a built-in sampling, if you will, because this brand means something. I think it also leads to greater consistency in returns, et cetera.  The business itself though will be determined on how successful the pipeline of films is. Bob mentioned our confidence in the strength of our film pipeline. We feel very good about it. Time will tell just how well it performs but we\u2019ve got WALL\u2022E coming out this summer. That\u2019s a video release for next year. We\u2019ve got Bolt, the first animated film out of the Disney Animation Studios since the deal with Pixar, we feel very good about that title for next year and that would likely have its home video release in 2009.  So at this point, we certainly wouldn\u2019t make any predictions about where the studio will be next year. The best thing you can have is a studio that is continually setting up tough comparisons and right now we\u2019ve got a studio that is doing that, so I feel pretty good about that. \nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer: Thank you. \nLowell Singer: Thanks. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Imran Khan with J.P. Morgan, please proceed. \nImran Khan - J.P. Morgan: Thank you for taking my questions; two questions, one for Bob and one for Tom. Tom, you know, your cable networks margins are improving for the last few years, so I was wondering how should we think about the cable networks margins for fiscal 2008 and over the next three to five years? And the second question, Bob, you talked about how videogames extending the demographics and that\u2019s an opportunity for Disney. Could you give us some color -- do you believe that the Disney characters driven videogame has a broader appeal in the international market? And are you satisfied with your studio? Do you see a need to acquire a larger studio for videogame makers, basically? Thank you. \nThomas O. Staggs: We have seen margin improvement in the cable nets and I think that one of the primary drivers of that, of course, is ESPN. Because ESPN has its affiliate agreements locked in for several years in the future and because the major sports rights for the most part are locked in for a period of time going forward, we\u2019ve mentioned that we think that we\u2019ve got a leverageable cost base.  We\u2019ve also been investing quite actively in Disney branded programming for our Disney Channels and our Disney programming blocks around the world. And we had said a few years ago that we expected to show less growth in the Disney Channels as we invested in that programming, and that the benefit of that would be seen across our other businesses and that\u2019s exactly what we are seeing.  We\u2019ll continue to make those investments but as our efforts to broaden distribution -- this is looking out over the next three to five years -- as our efforts to broaden distribution internationally, as those channels mature and as we start to anniversary some of our higher programming investment, I think there is an opportunity for the Disney Channels to start to contribute to margin growth as you get out towards the end of that time period.  So I think that we feel there is more we can do in terms of margins at the cable networks with continued creative success and given the strength and positioning of ESPN. So we are hopeful that we\u2019ll continue to deliver on margins the way we have been. \nRobert A. Iger: On the game side, we are comfortable with the developers that we\u2019ve bought. They\u2019ve enabled us to ramp up investment and production in a focused and deliberate way. We never intended to go from zero to 60 in four seconds because that business is both risky and is highly dependent upon not only quality titles but quality production. And so we\u2019ve taken what I\u2019ll call a combination of an aggressive and a patient approach, meaning aggressive in terms of our intent to go into the business at a significant level but patient in the sense that we didn\u2019t believe that it had to happen all at once. And we like that discipline.  We\u2019ll remain open to buying more development teams and more talent if we believe that that\u2019s how it can basically fuel our production of quality titles. But again at this point, we are pretty satisfied with where we are. And we do see the ability to leverage Disney games titles on a global basis not just on what I\u2019ll call console platforms or handheld devices but also online, which in some markets like Asia and notably South Korea and China, will become more and more important, and are more important today. \nImran Khan - J.P. Morgan: Great. Thank you. \nLowell Singer: Thanks. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Anthony DiClemente with Lehman Brothers, please proceed. \nAnthony DiClemente - Lehman Brothers: Thanks for taking my questions. One for Tom and one for Bob; Tom, at the parks, you talked about the strength in occupancy. Last quarter the number of room nights available were slightly down year over year in the 1Q. I was wondering if that trend continued in the 2Q. Is that a way that you can manage the efficiency of the park, both in terms of costs and in terms of occupancy level? And then Bob, following up on the comments on cable networks, just given the strength of ESPN and Disney Channel and given the strength of your balance sheet, I just wonder if you\u2019ve considered growing your exposure to the cable networks businesses via acquisition. There might be some properties out there that could fit well with the Disney brand. Thank you. \nThomas O. Staggs: Well, with regard to park occupancy, the available room nights wasn\u2019t dramatically different year over year at all in this Q2 and occupied rooms actually at Walt Disney World, for example, was within 1% year over year. So there\u2019s not a lot of shift as a result of that.  But you asked about efficiency -- yes, to the extent that we needed to, we would look at total rooms available and from a standpoint of managing costs across our properties. We\u2019ve done that in the past, to the extent that we saw an opportunity to both manage costs and also take advantage of an enhanced opportunity to do routine maintenance, et cetera. So that\u2019s a weapon at our disposal, should it be necessary. \nAnthony DiClemente - Lehman Brothers: And how does that actually work? Do you shut down portions of certain hotels or how does that mechanically work, if you were to go that route?\nThomas O. Staggs: Yes, in other words, what we\u2019ve done in the past in -- after 2001, we selectively shut down wings of certain hotels that were due for scheduled maintenance. We were able to do the maintenance during the day on a concerted basis. It saved us on the maintenance. It also saved us on the cost of operating the hotel, so that\u2019s something that we can look at if it becomes an issue. As you can tell from the occupancies that we are reporting, however, it\u2019s not an issue right now. \nRobert A. Iger: And on the cable net side, we look at any potential acquisitions with similar discipline in a way, whether they fit well strategically, whether we believe that they are right priced and have the ability to grow and deliver the kind of returns that we typically demand.  Specifically in the cable business, we are more bullish on channels or businesses that are branded, that are specific in terms of their program focus, and would be less interested in what I\u2019ll call general entertainment, more commoditized cable program plays. But again, the first criteria would be again right price and whether we would have the ability to grow the business within the Walt Disney Company. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, Anthony. Operator, we have time for one more question. \nOperator: David Miller with SMH Capital, please proceed. \nDavid Miller - SMH Capital: Bob, just sort of an offbeat question for you with regard to WALL\u2022E -- if you look at the last few Pixar films, besides just being huge box office winners, they\u2019ve enhanced your other businesses in different ways. Cars, for example, huge consumer products play. Finding Nemo as a big home video seller. Ratatouille, not really a consumer products play but a huge revenue generator overseas in terms of box office. Now here we go with WALL\u2022E -- can you just sort of talk about the overall tone of the film and how you see it enhancing the other businesses within your platform? Thank you. \nRobert A. Iger: Well, first of all we see WALL\u2022E as a great film by a great director from a great studio, and we\u2019ve seen a fair amount of creativity already in terms of consumer products. There\u2019s some great toys and we are working on a variety of potential applications for our parks, but -- and so we are poised to take advantage of broad and deep success when it comes. But right now, I can\u2019t say exactly how we\u2019ll be able to leverage the success of this until we really see it. But we are big believers in the film and the concept and in particular the lead character.  I can tell you that, since I know you have kids, Dave, you ought to get in line to buy the WALL\u2022E robot because it is going to be a pretty hot seller. Having played with it, I think it\u2019s going to be real in demand for Christmas season, about the time that the DVD comes out. \nDavid Miller - SMH Capital: Thank you. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, David. All right, everyone, thanks again for joining us today.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Shareholder Services. \nLowell Singer:  Thanks, Operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to The Walt Disney Company\u2019s first quarter fiscal \u201908 call. Today\u2019s call is being webcast and the webcast can be accessed on our Investor Relations website. The press release was issued a few minutes ago. It\u2019s also available on our website. Following today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll provide a replay, as well as an MP3 file and a written transcript on the website. Joining me in Burbank for today\u2019s call are Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tom Staggs, our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob is going to lead off, followed by Tom. We\u2019ll then open it up to Q&A. I hope you will stick around after the Q&A because besides reading our Safe Harbor provisions, I may just go ahead and endorse a candidate.  So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob and we\u2019ll get started. \nRobert A. Iger: Thank you very much, Lowell and good afternoon. I am pleased to report we\u2019ve started off our 2008 fiscal year with another outstanding quarter, marked by strong creative and financial performances. These results validate our strategic focus and I am extremely proud of our people, their talent, experience, and commitment to quality and integrity.  There are numerous specifics I could mention but I will leave that to Tom and summarize instead what we believe are our strategic priorities, as well as what we see is our competitive advantage.  Before I do that, two items to note -- we\u2019re extremely gratified by the $31 million opening weekend box office of The Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus 3D Concert Film, the highest ever domestic gross during a Super Bowl weekend. Its impressive performance highlights our mission perfectly -- that is to create high quality content and apply innovative technology to raise the level of the consumer experience in a way that differentiates Disney and reaches more people in new ways.  Regarding the Writers Guild Strike, it did not have a significant impact on the quarter that we are just announcing and we are hopeful an agreement will be reached soon and the writers will return to work.  Our first quarter performance illustrates a concept we have been articulating lately, which we call the Disney difference and I would like to elaborate on it because I believe it can deliver consistent value to shareholders and because it sets us apart from our competitors.  It begins with the fact that we now have multiple creative engines capable of developing and producing quality content in numerous ways, from the Disney Channel, the studio and Pixar to ESPN and ABC, including our music group, our video games groups, our Internet group, publishing and our parks and resorts and Walt Disney Imagineering.  High School Musical and Hannah Montana came from The Disney Channel; Pirates of the Caribbean began at our parks and resorts, Cars and Toy Story are from Pixar, and the Jonas Brothers were brought in by our music group, and all are examples of Disney branded creative content emanating from different parts of our company? Now this set of creative engines has recently given rise to many new franchises that provide us with a running start in any marketplace at any given time, so in essence we begin each year with a strong brand and franchise foundation and then build on it with great new stories and characters coming from multiple places. This now includes international markets where we are investing aggressively to create locally relevant, lasting Disney content.  Five years ago we could count upon only two major franchises and today we have 10 vibrant creative properties which are managed and promoted on an integrated basis across business lines. In 2007, two of these, Disney Princesses and Cars, were the most popular lines in their categories worldwide, outselling longtime favorites.  Another important aspect of the Disney Difference is our ability to leverage success across all businesses and territories. Miley Cyrus\u2019 incredible weekend box office results and the sale of 8 million CDs are examples. Her sold out summer concert tour, the Hannah Montana videogame, popular consumer products lines and hit special event appearances that have driven traffic on Disney.com also underline the point.  Another one of our major franchises, High School Musical, is not only a successful television franchise for and from The Disney Channel, but it will also be a feature film later this year and has already produced huge hits in music, publishing, and consumer products. So far, more than 15 million DVDs and more than 15 million soundtrack albums have been sold and it can be seen at our parks and resorts where a live High School Musical entertains guests numerous times a day, as an ice show in arenas across America, and in more than 2,500 school and amateur productions.  High School Musical is also a major international phenomenon, with a sold-out concert tour of Latin America and a new stage show heading to 10 international territories this year.  Let me mention one of our other franchises, which speaks to the enduring popularity of our content and our ability to leverage success. When Toy Story was first created by Pixar, it was an enormous hit, spawning the even more successful Toy Story 2, as well as a range of merchandise and attractions at our parks and resorts. Eight years after the last theatrical release, Toy Story licensed merchandise sales are over $400 million annually at retail.  Over the next few years, you will see a lot of creativity stemming from this wonderful franchise. This year, a fantastic new attraction, Toy Story Mania, is opening at Disneyland and Walt Disney World, as is a new stage show on our cruise lines. They join the popular Buzz Lightyear attraction already delighting guests at each of our global attractions.  In 2009, new 3D versions of the first two movies will arrive in theaters and in 2010, Toy Story 3 will arrive on the big screen, accompanied by Disney published videogame and a new merchandise line.  Two other aspects of the Disney Difference are worth mentioning -- the first is our ability to market far more effectively and efficiently than our competitors. Our internal estimates show that consumers last year spent around 13 billion hours immersed in the Disney brand, including 10 billion hours spent watching The Disney Channel around the globe, 800 million hours having fun at our parks and resorts, and nearly 1.2 billion hours watching Disney movies in the theater, on DVD, or on their computers.  Our mandate is to use these various platforms, as well as our radio networks, retail outlets, and a growing number of popular online destinations to fully support cross-business initiatives and grow value. This enables us to reach people effectively and to do so efficiently and economically.  Finally, the Disney name itself differentiates us as a brand that people seek out and trust. It opens doors to new platforms and markets and hence to new consumers. It also greatly lengthens the potential lifespan and the value of our creative output.  In sum, we believe this dynamic set of valuable business traits creates sustainable shareholder value. It makes us stand out in a cluttered media world and it can help us temper the impact of challenging economic conditions.  While I focused here on the Disney brand, I am also extremely proud of ESPN and ABC, and both are producing great content and are successfully leveraging it across multiple platforms and markets.  The Walt Disney Company is in great shape and we have enormous creative momentum that is inventing new hits and sustaining old favorites like never before. And we are using the latest technology to enhance our creativity and distribute our entertainment in all kinds of exciting and innovative ways.  And with that, here\u2019s Tom Staggs. \nThomas O. Staggs: Thanks, Bob and good afternoon. We\u2019re happy to report solid revenue growth and a double-digit increase in segment operating income in the first quarter. Excluding gains on asset sales in Q1 of last year, we have once again delivered double-digit bottom line growth as well.  Our media network set the pace again in Q1, delivering double-digit growth in revenue and operating income, driven in large measure by advertising and affiliate revenue growth at our cable networks. In addition, ABC Family benefited from lower programming costs as the prior year was the last in their legacy deal with Major League Baseball. Home video sales of High School Musical 2 contributed to our upside as well.  The Disney Channel is one of the most important drivers of the Disney brand and one of our most vibrant creative engines. We continue to invest in original programming and in the reach of our Disney channels around the world.  At ESPN, growth in affiliate revenues was dampened somewhat by revenue deferrals totaling roughly $50 million more than what was deferred in Q1 of last year. However, ESPN enjoyed double-digit growth in ad revenues in the quarter driven by NASCAR, higher ratings in key demos, and the strength of the ad market. These higher revenues were offset by increased sports rights and programming costs, primarily due to the addition of NASCAR.  At broadcasting, operating income improved by 30% versus last year. Although ratings were somewhat lower at ABC, the network ranked number one during the November sweeps for the third consecutive year in key demos and advertising revenue growth for the quarter was solid.  The strong ad market and tight supply helped us keep scatter CPMs significantly above up-front levels. The ad market strength has continued into our second quarter with CPMs again tracking double-digit percentages ahead of up-front pricing. Our TV station results reflected lower ad revenues due to significantly higher political spending in our major markets in the prior year. So far in Q2, ad sale [cessations] are pacing ahead of prior year by mid-single-digit percentages.  Our parks and resorts segment also delivered double-digit growth in revenues and operating income, driven in part by record Q1 attendance at our domestic parks. For the quarter, attendance at our combined domestic parks was 3% above the prior year, with Walt Disney World up 4%, driven by increased visitors from both the domestic and international guest segments. Disneyland attendance was slightly above prior year levels.  Per capita spending at Walt Disney World grew 3% and spending at Disneyland increased 2%.  Turning to our resorts, our Orlando hotel occupancy was up four percentage points to 89% while Disneyland occupancy of 91% was a little below last year. Per room spending for our combined domestic resorts was also strong, coming in just above the prior year at Walt Disney World and low double-digit percentages ahead of last year at Disneyland.  At our international parks, both Paris and Hong Kong parks enjoyed double-digit growth in attendance during Q1. At Disneyland Resort Paris, the 15th anniversary celebration campaign and recently opened Pixar-based attractions continue to resonate well with guests.  Attendance at Hong Kong Disneyland improved significantly versus the prior year as our entertainment offerings during Halloween and the holidays helped to boost attendance from both the local Hong Kong market and Mainland China.  While the momentum in Hong Kong continued during the first part of Q2, the recent severe weather and associated travel difficulties in China are affecting attendance from the mainland this week, which could impact the important Chinese New Year period.  Looking ahead at our domestic parks and resorts, room reservations on the books for Q2 through 4 of this fiscal year are modestly ahead of where they were at this time last year. Bear in mind that Easter falls in fiscal Q2 this year versus fiscal Q3 last year, which will skew individual quarter comparisons somewhat.  We aren\u2019t going to forecast the economy and at this point, the trends don\u2019t tell us enough to predict precisely how the remainder of the year will unfold. Having said that, we are pleased with the current pace of business at our parks, particularly given the record attendance we achieved last year. Of course, we\u2019ll respond quickly to changes in market conditions, if they occur, and more importantly we feel that the unique appeal of our theme park and resort properties and our experienced parks management team position us well to make the most of whatever economic conditions exist.  Turning to studio entertainment, our success at the box office has continued. Ratatouille was especially strong in international markets and it now stands as the third-highest grossing Disney Pixar movie in terms of worldwide box office. We are also pleased with the strong box office performances of our holiday releases Enchanted and National Treasure: Book of Secrets.  The studio faced tough comparisons in home entertainment versus last year\u2019s Q1, which featured Cars, the second Pirates film, and The Little Mermaid. This year, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World\u2019s End and Ratatouille performed well but DVD unit sales came in roughly 9% behind last year\u2019s remarkable results. Bear in mind that Q1 this year included just the domestic and limited international home video release of Ratatouille, whereas the prior year included the worldwide DVD release of Cars.  The tremendous growth in operating profit at consumer products this quarter is further evidence of how we can take successful branded content from one creative center and leverage it across our multiple lines of business to generate higher returns on these creative franchises. The biggest drivers of consumer products growth in Q1 were sales of merchandise and videogames based on our hit Disney Channel properties. We\u2019re especially pleased to see the strong results in videogames.  The Disney brand and our strong portfolio or franchises position us well to grow our videogame business and we intend to continue to ramp up our development investment in this business.  Bob referenced the expansion of our key character franchises. We believe this broad and growing stable of properties can enable us to continue to grow our licensing business across franchises and product categories.  As you think about Q2 though, it\u2019s worth knowing that we expect to recognize roughly $30 million less in minimum guarantees across our consumer products business in Q2 of this year versus Q2 of last year.  We\u2019ve continued to repurchase our stock this year and given our strong results and free cash flow, we expect further share repurchases going forward. For the fiscal year so far, we\u2019ve repurchased about 46 million shares for roughly $1.5 billion.  Our earnings this quarter once again provide evidence of the competitive advantage offered by the unique, broad-based power of our brands and entertainment franchises, and our ability to develop and leverage them across multiple creative engines and platforms. This focus and our integrated approach to managing our company have enabled us to build a strong portfolio of endearing franchises and a solid base of business from which to grow.  With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lowell for Q&A. \nLowell Singer:  Thanks, Tom. Operator, we are ready to begin the Q&A session. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Michael Nathanson, Sanford Berstein.\nMichael Nathanson - Sanford C. Berstein: Thanks. I have one for Tom. It\u2019s about the parks and the cost base. I wonder if you can talk a bit about what the split of the cost base is between fixed and variable now and has that changed over the years. And as you talked before about you\u2019re good at managing through different economic environments, what type of revenue slowdown can you absorb before perhaps it would be impact and what can you do on a cost base to absorb that slowdown if there was a slowdown?\nThomas O. Staggs: Well, as you know, our business at the parks has evolved over time and while we haven\u2019t given out a specific percentage, it would be difficult to do so as to what is fixed and what is variable. It\u2019s important to know that we do have considerable leeway to add costs based on demand or to take costs out based on a lack thereof, and so as you\u2019ve seen as recently as 2001, we\u2019ll adjust park hours. We\u2019ll adjust rooms that we make available. We\u2019ll adjust number of entertainment offerings, et cetera, so that the -- while there is clearly a fairly large fixed cost base in parks, we do have the ability to dial up and down our costs.  Having said that, back to your point about the evolution of the business, I think it is important to note that we\u2019ve added both size and scope in the business. Our vacation club business has turned out to be very resistant to downturns. Our cruise business frankly is significantly stronger right now than it was this time last year and has shown itself to be very resilient through any economic conditions, so that -- we\u2019re more excited than ever about having two new ships coming on.  We are building out our international base and seeing the improvement in Paris and the improvement in Hong Kong I think bodes well for further broadening this base of business at the parks.  And I think Bob had noted just on the last call that we find that people tend to cancel a planned vacation infrequently, very infrequently, and so as I said on the call in the prepared remarks, the pace of business to us looks pretty good. We feel like we\u2019ve got the ability to respond if necessary but right now, we\u2019re feeling pretty optimistic about where things go from here. \nLowell Singer:  Thanks, Michael. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.\nDoug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank: Thank you very much. I wanted to ask a question on the film margins, but just a clarification on the prepared remarks, Tom, regarding the bookings -- so you are saying that the bookings are up in the March quarter despite tough comparisons against Easter, is that question.  But for film, I understand why film revenues were flat for the quarter. I\u2019m more interested in why film costs were up 5% in the face of flat revenue. It was the only division that showed margin compression. \nThomas O. Staggs: Just to be clear, Easter last year fell in the third quarter and so more of the spring break was in the third quarter last year. That\u2019s moving to the second quarter this year, which actually would help the second quarter comparison year over year, which is why in the prepared remarks, I wanted to give you a sense of what rooms on the books look like for the remainder of the year to sort of help you look through that shift.  So yes, Q2 bookings are up nicely over the prior year but we think some of that is caused by the timing of Easter. So if you look at total rooms on the books Q2 through 4, we\u2019re up modestly versus the prior year and we feel good about that.  With regard to film costs, what\u2019s important to do is break down the nature of the revenues. We had strong theatrical performance this year and we had strong but not as strong performance in home video.  As you know, when you put films under the theatrical window, that the margin is dramatically lower. We\u2019re amortizing the P&A, we\u2019re amortizing a good piece of the film costs and so that\u2019s naturally going to be a lower margin activity.  So when home video is driving your results, your margins are going to come up. When theatrical is driving your revenues, you are going to see the margins come down. So it\u2019s a natural course of business and I don\u2019t think you should read into that there\u2019s an issue or something that\u2019s changed meaningfully in the nature and makeup of either our cost base or our revenue. \nDoug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank: Thank you. \nLowell Singer:  Thanks, Doug. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Spencer Wang with Bear Stearns.\nSpencer Wang - Bear Stearns: Thanks and good morning. Just going back to the parks, Tom, you referenced the vacation clubs. Can you just size for us how big that business is for you guys in terms of revenue and/or EBIT? And how do you book those vacation club sales? Are those just booked in the quarter where the units are sold?  And then my last question is just on international parks. I think the press release referenced some real estate sales. Can you just tell us how big that was in terms of EBIT or if it was material? Thank you. \nThomas O. Staggs: Sure. We don\u2019t break out the vacation club. Part of the reason that we don\u2019t break out the vacation club is that it can vary based on quarter, based on the units that we have available for sale when we are bringing inventory online, et cetera.  Generally speaking, we invest in vacation club, that investment actually shows up on the balance sheet in the form of inventory. When we make a sale, we book the lion\u2019s share of the sale, although some of the sale actually comes through over time, a smaller portion of it, because it\u2019s a commitment that\u2019s made.  And the vacation club business for us has been one that\u2019s been, as I mentioned, both stable and growing and we are actually really pleased to have new vacation club developments in the works as we\u2019ve talked about in previous calls and in press releases. \nSpencer Wang - Bear Stearns: And on the international real estate sales, Tom?\nThomas O. Staggs: International real estate, that really is driven by Disneyland Paris and so the detail of that you would get in the semi-annual results from Paris, but as you may know, there\u2019s considerable real estate surrounding our park at Disneyland Paris and part of the strategy there is to make sure that we are encouraging area development, which drives economic activity in the area and then obviously hotel and resort business for the park. And so that actually is part of the long-term strategy of that business. So from time to time, as some of that land is put into use, there will be gains on land sales there.  First of all, it wasn\u2019t a tremendous driver in the quarter but in terms of profitability, but second of all, if you look through that you still saw very nice increases in attendance at Disneyland Paris, and so we are exceptionally pleased with what we\u2019ve seen over the last four, five, six quarters at Paris. \nSpencer Wang - Bear Stearns: Thank you very much. \nLowell Singer:  Thanks, Spencer. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ingrid Chung with Goldman Sachs.\nIngrid Chung - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Good afternoon. First, Bob, you talked about building franchises earlier. How would you describe the lifecycle of these franchises? When do these franchises peak? And what are some of the new emerging franchises that you are excited about?\nRobert A. Iger: Well, first of all, about the lifecycle, one of the things that we\u2019ve observed over the years is that when we put the Disney name on a high quality character franchise, the lifecycle or the lifespan that such a franchise can deliver value is seemingly endless. And the fact of the matter is, we have Mickey and Pooh, still our two largest franchises that are decades old. But a number of the princesses that became a franchise were created out of movies that were also made decades ago.  What we\u2019ve been doing is as we create a high quality franchise and it emerges as a real success in a given business, we gauge whether we believe that success if leverageable across all of our businesses and in multiple territories, and then to what extent we really believe that by investing in that franchise, it can continue to create value over a long period of time. And with that, we\u2019ve given birth to a number of franchises over just the last three or four years, or we\u2019ve turned entities into franchises that were created in the recent past. Toy Story would be a good example.  The ones, of course, that we\u2019re most excited about recently are things like High School Musical and Hannah Montana clearly, but also Baby Einstein would be another example of that. Pirates of the Caribbean is another franchise.  Cars is probably the one that we believe has the biggest potential for the longest period of time and I think that\u2019s evidenced by the fact that we are selling more merchandise in the marketplace now than we did in the year that the film was released. So we\u2019ve clearly struck a nerve in terms of a play pattern and that has led us to invest in more creativity. So we\u2019ll be launching a virtual online world for cars and while I don\u2019t have a specific announcement to make, I think it would be a relatively good bet that ultimately there will be a sequel in the works for Cars, again because we believe in the franchise potential of that set of characters.  And then of course, lastly, when we really believe something has franchise value, we turn it into attractions at the parks and we are building Cars Land for California Adventure set to open in 2012 and we opened a Cars related attraction in Paris this past year, and I\u2019m fairly certain you\u2019ll see more creativity and investment in terms of physical attractions at our parks against that franchise. \nIngrid Chung - Goldman Sachs: And do you view Ratatouille as a franchise also?\nRobert A. Iger: Nothing against Ratatouille in terms of how great it was creatively -- five Academy Award nominations, but no, that wouldn\u2019t be one that we would consider a true franchise in terms of its leverageability across multiple businesses, or its ability to drive huge value over a long period of time. It is a classic and I am fairly certain that we\u2019ll be able to bring out the Ratatouille DVD or whatever the form might be years to come on a fairly regular basis and it will thrill generations of kids into the future, but I don\u2019t see us turning that into the kind of franchise that will rise to the level of Cars, Princesses, Pirates, Mickey, Pooh, Toy Story, et cetera. \nIngrid Chung - Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. Thank you. \nLowell Singer:  Ingrid, thanks. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif-Cohen with Merrill Lynch.\nJessica Reif-Cohen - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Tom or Bob, when you think about your businesses, where do you think you have the most room for revenue and margin improvement? I mean, it would seem to be, but I\u2019m not sure you\u2019d agree with this, cable networks and consumer products. And I guess the flipside of that is how much more can broadcast grow, because you seem to be at peak margins relative to some of the other companies, and theme parks also I think you are on targeted margins. \nRobert A. Iger: I think it\u2019s -- expecting that we are going to grow margins significantly in the broadcast business would probably be wrong. While I don\u2019t know that we are necessarily at peak, I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s significant room ahead. Where we could expand margins, of course, is with greater success with company produced and owned series, which gives us more leveragability on a global basis, particularly as the world builds out in terms of its ability to distribute and ultimately consumer intellectual property like that.  We definitely believe we have margin expansion in our parks and resorts in general, either in core business or by investing in adjunct businesses -- the cruise ships that we are building would be examples of that, the vacation club Tom talked about earlier. We demonstrated last quarter, the one that we just announced, that there clearly is improvement potential in our international theme parks and we believe that the results from Paris and Hong Kong certainly demonstrate that.  And then to the point you made, we think we\u2019ve got considerable margin expansion potential across a wide range of consumer products businesses, notably videogames, but also supporting these franchises on a worldwide basis and growing retail sales against these franchises worldwide.  And I\u2019d say certainly on the cable networks front, particularly with The Disney Channel as we grow distribution and worldwide Disney Channel operations. Now that may cost us a little bit initially with some investment to grow distribution but I think over the long run, we will not be increasing our cost to distribute or our programming costs as much as we will be getting back with increased distribution and the subsequent subscription fee and advertising that comes with it. \nLowell Singer:  Thanks, Jessica. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Imran Khan with J.P. Morgan.\nImran Khan - J.P. Morgan: Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions, one on parks; so Tom, you talked about the attendance but can you help us to understand if -- can you help us understand the growth of attendance, attendance growth international versus U.S., so to try to get a better sense of what percentage of your growth is coming from international attendance versus the U.S.  And secondly, looking at the broadcasting margins that improved on a year-over-year basis, how should we think about ABC margin expansion opportunity from here on? And NBC talked about reducing the number of pilots. What\u2019s your plan? Can you give us some color on that? Thank you. \nThomas O. Staggs: Sure. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the biggest increases at the parks in terms of attendance is really driven out of the domestic tourist segment and the international segment. Now, on a percentage gain basis, international was the strongest but the domestic portion is obviously a little bit larger to begin with. And so what\u2019s interesting to us is that in the first quarter, we continue to see strength in both of those places and moreover, even though international is strong and, as one might have expected with the dollar being weaker and as we get through a vacation booking cycle, we\u2019re seeing that strength. We are at the same time pleased to see the gains in attendance at, for example, Disneyland Paris.  So I hope that\u2019s helpful. \nRobert A. Iger: I think what we saw last quarter at our parks, not to throw in a Miley Cyrus pun, but it was the best of both worlds because I think the weakness of the dollar against foreign currencies has probably resulted in fewer Americans traveling overseas and has resulted in more people from international markets traveling to the U.S. and I think that\u2019s why we had record attendance at our domestic parks. It came from basically both sides, which is great.  But to the second part of your question about broadcasting margins, you mentioned the number of pilots. It\u2019s safe to assume that, given the fact that we\u2019ve had a work stoppage because of the writers\u2019 strike, and even if there is a settlement soon and the writers go back to work quickly, it is guaranteed that we will make far fewer pilots this year than we have made in the past and there will be some savings there. Unfortunately, that comes at a time when, because of the work stoppage, there will also be some revenue loss because of our decrease in the number of shows that we can sell on a worldwide basis that we have owned primarily.  So I don\u2019t think that you are necessarily going to see much margin improvement in that business in the very near term. I still think there is some margin improvement possible in that business. We\u2019ve been heartened by the incredible strength of the scatter marketplace and the strength of advertising in general for ABC and so there might be some -- there actually might be some revenue growth potential. And then we\u2019ve learned in part thanks to the work stoppage that business as usual just does not work and what that primarily means is an attack on costs.  And I think you will see a reduction in general of costs in that business over the next few years that while I don\u2019t know they will necessarily have a dramatic effect on margin improvement, it certainly has the potential to deliver some. \nImran Khan - J.P. Morgan: Great. Thank you. \nLowell Singer:  Thanks, Imran. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Lehman Brothers.\nAnthony DiClemente - Lehman Brothers: Thanks for taking the question. In thinking about the sensitivity of cable network advertising to a recessionary slowdown, have you seen any of that to date and do you think that there\u2019s a chance that the cable networks are a little more insulated from an economic slowdown because these are national advertisers as opposed to local and do you think that a potential recessionary slowdown would be mitigated by dollars coming out of broadcast and into cable networks? Thanks. \nRobert A. Iger: Well, we\u2019re fortunate in many ways that The Disney Channel in the U.S. does not take advertising and has healthy sub-fees and so they are immune completely to a recession, certainly in the United States.  On the ESPN side, we have an extremely strong dual revenue stream that comes from one of the healthiest subscription fee bases in the country, and that obviously helps. But on the ad side for ESPN, their pacings have generally been strong. They are still a very strong brand and live sports are still very attractive from an entertainment perspective and that obviously I think is what helps drive the advertising rates.  I also -- I don\u2019t really think you\u2019ll see us benefit significantly from a migration from advertising that moves from network to cable. We\u2019re not all that exposed, really, when it comes to advertising as a company. Only about 20% of our revenue comes from advertising, and so when you think of this company and you think about recession, the impact from an advertising perspective is not all that significant. \nLowell Singer:  Thanks, Anthony. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield with Pali Capital.\nRich Greenfield - Pali Capital: Hi, a couple of questions; one, when you look back to the last recession in the early 90s, you obviously had a lot fewer hotel rooms at value prices. I was wondering if you could give us some sense of how you think the mix of your overall hotel pool insulates you or at least lessens the impact from a potential recession in the U.S., and maybe give us some sense of what the actual price point mix now is versus what it might have been back then.  And then two, Ann Sweeney at the analyst meeting last year I think said that you had sold 6.5 million DVDs for High School Musical 1 by the time of the analyst meeting worldwide and I was wondering for High School Musical 2 standing in early February, where that number would stand on a relative basis.  And then just a housekeeping point -- the press release says that you had some non-recurring gains in the investment income line. I\u2019m just wondering if you could size those for us and what that might have impacted earnings by on an after-tax basis. Thanks. \nThomas O. Staggs: With regard to the value priced hotels at the parks, I think Rich, you raise a good point, that is a broader hotel room base. We do have more inventory of affordable rooms and as importantly, I think, two other things -- one, we have introduced this really value-based pricing where we\u2019ve got a family of four, ability to be at the park for I think right now it\u2019s around $1600 for a week at the park with hotel and meal plan, et cetera. And that\u2019s a very strong value and a great alternative for folks. And we\u2019ve had a really good response to that.  We also have a very sophisticated yield management system that handles all the inventory of our rooms at the parks and I think that really stands us in good stead to take advantage of what is there in terms of demand at the highest possible ADR and we are certainly pleased with where we sit as a business, both in terms of our consumer appeal and then also our ability to respond and to have a broad-based business and inventory of rooms to respond with. \nRobert A. Iger: On the second question, High School Musical 2 worldwide will sell roughly the same number of DVDs as High School Musical 1, and the third part of the question was about -- \nThomas O. Staggs: Investment income. This last quarter, we had -- we have a company that -- a separate company that does venture capital investing for us called Steamboat Ventures. They\u2019ve been active since about 2001 and they invest in strategically relevant companies and actually, one of their primary missions is to make sure that we are really understanding exactly what is going on in the entrepreneurial community around our businesses and it\u2019s been a nice strategic boon from that standpoint. But obviously we also seek to make money from it and the returns have been quite nice.  This last quarter, they have realized a return on investment on a company called Quigo, that was purchased. It\u2019s an ad serving and optimization firm that actually in the early going helped to stimulate our thinking about how we approach that business. And so it was a win from both sides, but that\u2019s really what was driving that gain. \nRich Greenfield - Pali Capital: How much actually was that gain, just so we can actually look at what was organic earnings?\nThomas O. Staggs: The gain on the Quigo piece was $37 million in the quarter. \nRich Greenfield - Pali Capital: And then the delta piece?\nThomas O. Staggs: It was about 18. \nRich Greenfield - Pali Capital: Thanks so much. \nLowell Singer:  Okay, Operator -- \nThomas O. Staggs: Those are both pretax, by the way, Rich, in terms of the gains. \nLowell Singer:  Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.\nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer: Thanks. Two questions, one; is there a way you could give us the growth rate of affiliate fees in the quarter, I guess adjusting for the higher deferrals? And then second, clearly it\u2019s impressive what you are doing with these franchises. As we all begin to think about how to try to model that, I guess, longer term, when you used to talk about the syndication opportunities, you were able to quantify it in the billions of the long-term opportunity. How do you think we should think about Hannah Montana, High School Musical, Cars -- kind of what that opportunity is longer term for the company? Thanks. \nRobert A. Iger: Well, Jason, we don\u2019t break out affiliate fee growth in the quarter, so I think we can\u2019t answer that question. Although I think it\u2019s important to point out that there were affiliate fees deferred at ESPN, a substantial amount, actually.  On the second part of your question, the whole concept of franchise management is pretty interesting because you have to think about it across so many businesses. To give you a for instance, we\u2019ve been investing significantly in self-published video games and our initial foray into it was pretty mixed in terms of how we branded games, Disney and non-Disney. And then we\u2019ve decided that we can drive much more value when we create Disney product than when we create non-Disney.  And while there were a lot of doubters in the videogame space, what we have discovered is the growth in videogames that we are seeing is in one demographic and that is that you have more younger people playing videogames, particularly on platforms like the Wii and the Nintendo DS, and you also have more girls playing. And that plays right into our strategy, and so when you think High School Musical and Hannah Montana, you suddenly can envision a franchise that is living in many more places than just say the syndicated world of the past.  The other thing that we have also found is that music has really found a home in the videogames business. That is certainly clear with some of the properties that are out there from other companies, Rock Band would certainly be one of those, Guitar Hero the other, but High School Musical, Hannah Montana, at some point The Jonas Brothers and in effect, our music strategy becomes leverageable across multiple businesses too.  So what we are trying to do is essentially identify something that has franchise potential and then immediately invest to mine that potential creatively and then to leverage it financially in many, many places. And we are finding that those many places are many more than we used to see. Online virtual worlds another example. Think Cars -- you have to think not just them parks and movies and videos, but you have to think an online virtual world, as well as the other typical businesses like videogames and other merchandise.  So there\u2019s just -- thanks to technology, when you have a successful franchise and you have the ability as a company to invest in basically self-created product, you can leverage that in many more ways than we ever envisioned in the past. And we are structured as a company to do just that. \nThomas O. Staggs: Jason, back to your first question, as Bob said, we don\u2019t quote affiliate growth rates. The increase in affiliate revenues in the quarter was $138 million and as we mentioned, we deferred $53 million more in this first quarter than we did in the prior quarter, so if that\u2019s helpful. But as Bob said, we don\u2019t quote rates and the rates vary by individual channel, so they are not necessarily that useful anyway. \nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer: Okay. Thank you. \nLowell Singer:  Thanks, Jason. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citigroup.\nJason Bazinet - Citigroup: Thanks so much for taking the question -- just a quick question factually in terms minority interest in ESPN and profitability. Is it generally correct that you can take the minority interest, subtract -- you know, the total minority interest, subtract JETIX to get a sense of ESPN\u2019s profitability? And then second, is it directionally correct that ESPN as a share of your total profits had dropped fairly dramatically over the last four or five years, given the growth of the other segments?\nThomas O. Staggs: There\u2019s more going on in minority interest than what you cited. There\u2019s JETIX, there\u2019s Disneyland Paris, there\u2019s Hong Kong Disneyland, and so there\u2019s a fair amount going on in that line. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily encourage you to try to use it that directly to estimate ESPN profitability.  ESPN\u2019s profitability, if I go back five years or so ago, actually I think that its profitability as a percent of the total company has increased appreciably over that period of time. \nJason Bazinet - Citigroup: So it\u2019s actually gone up?\nThomas O. Staggs: Yeah. \nJason Bazinet - Citigroup: Okay. Thank you. \nLowell Singer:  Thanks, Jason. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Morris with UBS.\nMichael Morris - UBS: Thank you. A couple of questions back to the broadcasting segment -- first of all, the television programming sales on DVD and into syndication have been more important to you in the last few years. Can you give us a little feel for the risk, given a lack of content in the pipeline at this point, are these items that are going to be pushed out for a complete year? Is there a way to recapture it? And in particular, I\u2019m thinking about your syndication sales in \u201909 for a couple of key programs. And then second of all, you talk about scatter pricing strength in the quarter, but also it seems that ratings have been down pretty significantly across all broadcast networks. Can you talk about the dynamic there? Do you have make goods that are kind of offsetting some of that strength? And how sustainable is this model going forward? Thank you. \nThomas O. Staggs: I would say with regard to the pipeline on television programming, we still have a very strong pipeline. We\u2019ve talked about it in previous calls. As to the exact timing of the availability of that pipeline, of course that can be impacted by the timing of when we make episodes. But the strongest of the shows that are fed into that pipeline, I still expect those shows to be strong in their appeal, in terms of both international syndication and domestic syndication I think is intact.  So we feel reasonably good about that individual timing of shows there -- it\u2019s a little bit hard to predict until we know exactly when the strike might end and how quickly people will get back to work and what the timing is around that. \nRobert A. Iger: We also haven\u2019t made decisions if it does end how many shows we will produce in effect of this season, because you start ultimately because there will be a lag time in terms of when these shows will be available, you start backing into next year or butting up against next year and we haven\u2019t made any of those decisions yet. \nThomas O. Staggs: As you would expect, and Bob alluded to it, the ratings, as there\u2019s been less original programming on air, have come down -- have come down for virtually all the networks. Right now, from a make good standpoint, actually as I sit here today I have fewer make goods than I had a quarter ago and we are in good shape and I don\u2019t think you are going to see an impact from make goods. And as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve got a very strong scatter market which bodes well. \nMichael Morris - UBS: Thank you. \nLowell Singer:  Thanks, Mike. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen & Company.\nDoug Creutz - Cowen & Company: Thanks. You have a movie coming out later this year called Bolt and I was wondering if you could say how involved John Lasseter and Ed Campbell have been involved in the product of that movie, and do you think that that\u2019s likely to in terms of performance, act more like a Pixar movie or more like some of the CG movies you\u2019ve had out the last couple of years? Thanks. \nRobert A. Iger: I\u2019m not going to predict performance but John and Ed have been extremely involved in Bolt, so this is the first movie from Disney Animation that will really have been produced under their leadership and we have a good team under them that are getting a fair amount of direction from John and company but Bolt will be the first one I guess that the world can use to gauge the impact of that leadership on Disney Animation and so far, so good.  We think the movie is in excellent shape and we are very excited about it. It comes out at the end of the calendar year. \nThomas O. Staggs: So fiscal \u201909. \nDoug Creutz - Cowen & Company: Great. Thank you. \nLowell Singer:  Thanks, Doug. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi with Standard & Poor\u2019s.\nTuna Amobi - Standard & Poor\u2019s: Thank you very much. The consumer products business was certainly a nice surprise to us. So my question is how much of that is a function of some of these new franchises that you put out and how much of that could be a permanent shift in the -- in that business model? And related to that, Tom, how much of the $175 million development spending was accrued in the first quarter as opposed to the latter part of the year? And separately, I think this is the first time in a while I have heard some good vibes coming out of Hong Kong park, so the question is what is it that -- what are the major changes that you\u2019ve made in that park and do you believe that the park has turned the corner for good? And separately also, the mainland park in China, if you could update us as well on that timing -- \nRobert A. Iger: Tuna, you just asked about six questions in one. \nTuna Amobi - Standard & Poor\u2019s: I\u2019m sorry, but I thought -- \nRobert A. Iger: -- to remember them all. Your first question on consumer products, a lot of the growth in the first quarter consumer products came from new franchises -- High School Musical, Hannah Montana, Cars. But we also had significant success with traditional franchises -- Mickey and Pooh and Princesses.  But I think it bodes very well. If you were to ask Andy Mooney about his business, he would immediately say that just a few years ago, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, he could rely on two to three franchises and now he can rely on multiple franchises across the globe. And that obviously I think bodes very well for the near future for consumer products.  Tom will answer some of the tougher questions but your question about Hong Kong, Hong Kong obviously showed significant improvement last quarter. We were very, very bullish about the Chinese New Year, which basically came this week, but there\u2019s been horrible winter weather conditions across China, particularly Southern China and it\u2019s possible that could put a big of a damper on our results around Chinese New Year.  What we are seeing in terms of success in that park, Tom mentioned this in some of his remarks, is that events seem to drive a lot of business to the park, and we discovered that with Halloween and we basically, learning from that lesson, have created a number of events at the park and that\u2019s had a dramatic impact on increases in attendance, both from local Hong Kong residents and from people from the mainland, notably Southern China.  We\u2019ve also done I think a lot of very, very good work working with the travel trade, particularly the trade that brings mainlanders over, to make sure that when people visit Hong Kong, part of the itinerary is visiting the Hong Kong park. And we have added nicely to the menu of attractions at the parks, so far in a small way but that\u2019s going to ramp up. We opened Small World this year, as a for instance, and we have plans in place to continue to invest more in our attractions menu.  And I think the combination of that, improved marketing, and an event strategy will put Hong Kong Disneyland on a very, very positive path.  We\u2019re not making any comments about the potential development of a park on the mainland. There\u2019s been some press about it out of the mainland but we don\u2019t have any news to report, nor do we have anything to say about it further. \nThomas O. Staggs: Tuna, on the question with regard to development spending and interactive games, last year as you probably know we spent about $130 million on development. We said we were going to ramp that up this year. One of the things that Bob and I have been chatting about with Andy Mooney is the pace of that ramp-up, given the success and whether or not there are opportunities to invest a little bit more. We do expect development spending as it\u2019s incurred and so if we do ramp up, it would be seen in this year.  I would say that you should expect development spending at videogames at this point in the neighborhood of about $180 million to $200 million for fiscal 2008. \nTuna Amobi - Standard & Poor\u2019s: How much of that was in Q1, Tom?\nThomas O. Staggs: A commensurate part of it was in Q1. Q1, it was up about -- development spending I believe was up about 70% versus the prior year, so that\u2019s nearly $20 million in additional development spending. \nTuna Amobi - Standard & Poor\u2019s: Okay, thanks. \nLowell Singer:  Thanks, Tuna. Operator, we have time for one more question. \nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of David Miller with SMH Capital. \nDavid Miller - SMH Capital: Congratulations on the stellar results. Just two quick ones; first of all, Tom, if you mentioned the advertising sales growth number at ESPN for the quarter, I didn\u2019t hear it, so if you could disclose that, that would be great.  And then also Bob, just more of a philosophical question for you; if the strike were to end today as many -- let\u2019s just switch gears. If the strike were to end this week, as many newswires have been reporting and speculating, what exactly in your opinion just theoretically would that do to the up-front process? Would it push negotiations back more towards the mid to late summer timeframe? And would we be looking at potentially a delay in the start of the \u201908, \u201909 broadcast season? Or if the strike were to end later this week and everything gets back to normal, do you see the up-front process pretty much occurring as normal, as what happened last year? Thanks. \nRobert A. Iger: I think in terms of the up-front, advertisers are probably going to demand some kind of process in the spring basically under normal time circumstances, and I see us participating fairly aggressively in that process. That\u2019s the process of selling a significant amount of up-front time.  How we present the schedule and what schedule is presented is still open for discussion. I noted some comments about that yesterday from another media company. I will say that personally I think the matter that the up-front or the schedule is presented with the bells and whistles on a big stage and a fair amount of hors d\u2019oeuvres feels like a bit of an anachronism to me. But those decisions will be ultimately made by the network and what they feel is right in terms of the best approach to marketing their schedule to advertisers and to the press. \nThomas O. Staggs: With regard to advertising growth at ESPN, bear in mind that we had NASCAR coming on this year versus not as much last year, or not in the year last year. But if you back that out, you are still looking at low double-digit percentage growth in advertising revenue at ESPN. It was a little bit better rate than that if you include NASCAR. \nDavid Miller - SMH Capital: Thank you. \nLowell Singer:  Thanks, Dave. Thanks, everyone for joining us today. I\u2019m Lowell Singer and I approve the following message -- I want everyone to note that a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that were referred to on this call to equivalent GAAP measures can be found on our investor relations website.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for the Walt Disney Company. Please proceed. \nLowell Singer: Thank, Brittany. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to the Walt Disney Company's fourth quarter 2009 earnings call. Our press release was issued a few minutes ago. It\u2019s now available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today\u2019s call is also being webcast and that webcast will be available on our website, as will a replay and transcript of today\u2019s remarks.  Joining me in Burbank for today\u2019s call are Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; and for his 46th and as it turns out final earnings call as Chief Financial Officer, Tom Staggs. As I am sure you saw, Bob made an important executive announcement this morning. He is going to begin with some comments about that announcement, and then Bob and Tom will speak about earnings and then we will of course be happy to take your questions.  So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob and we will get started. \nRobert A. Iger: Thank you, Lowell and good afternoon. As you know, we announced earlier today that on January 1st, Tom Staggs will assume the role of Chairman, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, while Jay Rizzulo, who currently holds that position, will become Senior Executive Vice President and Disney\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Jay and Tom are dynamic, experienced and versatile executives who have each been at Disney for around 20 years. They know and understand the company and its brands intimately and are very effective leaders whose background are for the new roles. Since I have been CEO, they have been a critical part of the team helping implement the strategy that has led to our success. They are also ready for some exciting new challenges that will benefit both them and our company.  Tom, I think you would all agree, is one of the best CFOs around and over the last decade, he has worked closely with me, guiding the company strategically and has played a big part in everything from the Pixar and Marvel acquisitions to reconfiguring our management incentive system to helping ensure our team does the best possible job for its shareholders.  Throughout, he has done a great job of making sure our capital is put to the wisest possible use for long-term growth, as well as managing costs across the company. He has also played a key role in managing the Disney brand and leading a very successful implementation of our company-wide healthy food and environmental policies.  Jay has had a great success, he has great business skills and instincts and substantial creative experience as well. Under his leadership, the Disney park experience is reaching more people than ever before while enhancing its well-deserved reputation for quality. Even while overseeing major expansions at Anaheim and Hong Kong, Jay has done a fantastic job over the last seven years of taking our parks and resorts business beyond the theme park gates, as we have built up our cruise line, vacation club, and family tour businesses.  He has also successfully position our parks during the economic downturn through some really innovative marketing and smart management. Jay has also led our Shanghai park development efforts and we are very proud of the work he and his team have done.  From my perspective, it\u2019s incredibly valuable to a corporation like Disney to have executives gain experience in various parts of the organization. It gives them a new set of challenges, new perspectives, and a great opportunity for continued growth. Over the longer term, the practice of motivating and developing executives by providing new or expanded opportunities will help us attract and retain talented people and will serve the company well.  Given that he has been CFO for over a decade, I know you will miss Tom, as many of you can attest, Tom has done a great job providing information and perspective that has served both investors and the company well and I know that Jay will continue in the tradition Tom has established, serving us all equally well. I am really excited about continuing to collaborate with Jay and Tom in their new roles and feel these steps strengthen a management team that is already the best in the business.  Now I would like to turn to our earnings -- over the last 18 months, I have spoken to you about how we have sought to maintain our strategic focus while reshaping the company to both withstand the weak economy and to tackle the many challenges facing our businesses.  We believe we have delivered on those objectives, putting Disney in a strong competitive position while enhancing the company\u2019s ability to deliver long-term value to shareholders.  For the quarter, our earnings improved over a year ago largely due to the performance of our media networks. While there are some signs of recovery, the environment remains challenging and we are managing accordingly. Tom will speak in detail about our financial performance but I wanted to highlight a few of the steps we have taken to advance our fundamental strategic goals of building on our position as a leader in the creation of high quality branded content, of using technology to make that content more compelling and to reach more consumers in more ways, and at making Disney an even more prominent provider of entertainment globally.  As you know, last week the Chinese Government gave its approval for a Disney theme park in Shanghai and we are absolutely delighted this significant milestone has been reached and look forward to finalizing a deal with our partners in Shanghai to build a world-class resort where the People of China will be able to enjoy first hand an amazing mix of characters, stories, and experiences. With 1.3 billion people, increasing affluence, and one of the world\u2019s most unique and dynamic cultures, China is an important and promising country for us and we will not only become more so in the years to come but we feel truly privileged to have this opportunity.  We are also working toward closing the Marvel deal. Since we announced the acquisition at the end of August, it\u2019s become even clearer to us just how well-know and appealing Marvel characters are around the world and we are looking forward to increasing the visibility and value of Marvel\u2019s characters and stories across our businesses, platforms, and global markets.  As our numbers indicate, our studio had an extremely disappointing year in 2009. This is primarily due to the performance of our live action slate, but we also see challenges to the motion picture industry business model and we are taking steps to address them.  Our choice of Rich Ross as the new head of the studio is designed to both redirect and improve its creative endeavors, as well as to immediately and properly address the secular changes we are seeing. This requires aggressive focus on the cost of producing, marketing, and distributing our films. It also requires challenging the status quo of a business that is already witnessing real change in how consumers use their time and spend their money as entertainment sources proliferate and access to them becomes significantly easier. The studio restructuring announced yesterday is in keeping with this approach.  Additionally, the spread of faster Internet connectivity will increase global piracy threats and it is imperative the industry address these threats with vigor, cohesiveness, and a real sense the peril is both real and immediate. By adding Marvel to our slate of Disney and Pixar films, we will in the coming year be making movies under three of the best known labels in family entertainment. These brands resonate with consumers globally and give us a competitive advantage in a world of nearly limitless choice.  We will also continue to focus our investment on franchise properties like Princess and the Frog, Cars 2, Toy Story 3, and Pirates 4. When our franchise films are successful, they create a wave across the company that can lift up all of our Disney branded businesses.  While it remains a challenging time, it\u2019s also a very exciting one -- our parks and resorts business is expanding with the addition of attractions that bring together great creativity and fantastic new technologies at Disney's California Adventure, at Hong Kong Disneyland, and at the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World. Work is well underway on our new family resort in Hawaii and on two magnificent new cruise ships whose design we unveiled a couple of weeks ago in New York.  At ABC, we are off to a solid start in the fall season with several of the most watched shows, including new hits like Modern Family, Flash Forward, and V, and favourites like Grey\u2019s Anatomy and Desperate Housewives. ABC Family is a real success story as well, attracting a growing audience through terrific original programming, while Disney Channel has been posting its highest ever domestic ratings. The launch of the boy focused Disney XD has been successful in the U.S. and several key global markets while overall Disney Channel continues to show impressive international subscriber growth.  Earlier this year, ESPN also made a major move internationally with its purchase of Premiere League Rights in the U.K. and has deepened its relationship with its most avid fans by setting up local sports portals in key cities, including Chicago, Dallas, and Boston, with New York and Los Angeles to come soon. In the fourth quarter, ESPN posted its biggest ever audience numbers, helped in particular by college and pro football. Now 30 years old, ESPN remains an incredible innovator, both technologically and in the quality and scope of its content, bringing more great sports to more fans around the world in more ways than ever before.  ABC, ESPN, and Disney Channel remain three of the most creative and valuable brands in entertainment and all three of them are finding ways to reach new audiences in new ways and new places.  While it\u2019s been a very challenging period, the focus of our strategy has remained consistent -- invest in great content and experiences, nurture an environment where creativity can flourish and innovate aggressively to maintain relevance and meet the needs of our consumers. By keeping this focus and executing skilfully, we believe Disney's value can only increase over the long-term and now I will turn things over to Tom. Tom. \nThomas O. Staggs: Thanks, Bob and good afternoon, everyone. Before we turn to your questions, I will take a few minutes to highlight the key drivers for Q4 and touch on some of the factors that are likely to influence our results in fiscal 2010.  At media, cable networks operating income was up in the quarter, driven by ESPN. ESPN benefited from the recognition of $128 million more in net deferred affiliate revenue in this fourth quarter compared to the prior Q4. ESPN\u2019s operating income was also boosted by an extra week of subscriber revenue and higher subscriber rates compared to the prior year, partially offset by higher programming costs associated with new deals with the SEC, U.S. Tennis Open, and the English Premiere League Football.  ESPN ad sales came in flat to the prior year for the quarter. However, adjusting for the effect of the 53rd week, as well as the relative timing of major sports events, we estimate that ad sales would have been down by almost 3%.  Despite the tough environment and the increased investment in programming, our combined cable networks delivered growth this fiscal year, which is evidence of their strong business models and position in the marketplace.  At broadcasting, results improved on a higher sales of ABC produced shows, including Grey\u2019s Anatomy. At ABC, favorable timing of pilot costs and the extra week in the quarter offset the impact of lower ratings.  Q4 ad revenue at our TV stations excluding the extra week of sales came in just over 15% below the prior year, although the local ad market has shown some signs of improvement.  We are seeing a number of encouraging signs elsewhere in the ad market as well. So far in Q1, network scatter pricing is running more than 20% above up-front pricing levels. More over, option pick-ups for our Q2 are the highest we have seen in the last 10 years. We have also seen some improvement in ad sales trends at ESPN.  Q1 comparisons at our TV stations are made tougher due to last year\u2019s political ad revenue.  Bob mentioned we are disappointed with results at the studio, where operating performance was lower driven by film cost write-downs. Music sales were also off somewhat compared to last year\u2019s Q4, which included strong releases from The Jonas Brothers and Miley Cyrus.  Looking forward, the studio has a strong slate of upcoming films for 2010 -- key releases include our animated film The Princess and the Frog, coming to theaters nationwide on December 11th; Alice in Wonderland on March 5th, and Prince of Persia, Toy Story 3, and Sorcerer\u2019s Apprentice, all three of which are slated for release this summer.  At our consumer product segment operating results reflected the difficult retail environment\u2019s impact on our licensing, stores, and publishing businesses, as well as the strength of Hannah Montana and High School Musical properties in Q4 of the prior year.  Lower sales of merchandise across most categories drove a 20% decline in earned revenues at licensing for the quarter, in part because the impact of the downturn was not fully evident in our licensing business until the beginning of calendar 2009.  Turning to parks and resorts, whose results have recently taken on even greater significance in my mind, attendance at our domestic parks was up 10% in Q4, driven by the extra week in this year\u2019s fourth quarter and continued solid response to our promotional offers. Excluding the impact of the extra week, combined attendance was up 3% with a 15% increase at Disneyland offsetting a 3% decline at Walt Disney World.  Walt Disney World\u2019s occupancy came in at 84%, 5 percentage points below the prior year, while Disneyland\u2019s occupancy was 4 percentage points lower than last year also at 84%.  Not surprisingly, our promotional packages led to greater room and admissions discounting, which contributed to softer guest spending. Per capita guest spending at our domestic parks decreased by 10% and per room spending at our domestic resorts was off by 7%.  Looking ahead, Q1 domestic bookings at our resorts are running roughly 5% behind this time last year. But as we saw in the last few quarters, bookings are tending to take place closer to actual travel dates. It\u2019s difficult to predict how long the downturn will impact consumer spending and travel. We will continue to gauge the market and respond with promotions we feel are appropriate, including our recently announced offers which extend through March at Walt Disney World and through April at Disneyland.  These promotions have been well-received and there has been a pick-up in the bookings pace since we announced them. Our parks management has done a fine job of managing costs throughout this past year and those efforts continue as we enter 2010. At the same time, we remain committed to delivering the premium guest experience people expect form our parks and resorts.  As we enter 2010, we are pleased with some of the trends we are seeing but we also expect that the economic environment is likely to continue to pose challenges. We expect our pension and post retirement medical expenses to increase by approximately $270 million this year, driven in part by lower discount rates. Approximately half of this amount will impact our parks and resorts segment.  The relative strength of our cash flow in 2009 provides evidence of our ongoing focus on closely managing our spending, especially during the current downturn. At the same time, we remain committed to allocating capital toward growth opportunities that maximize value for our shareholders. Our first priority is to invest in existing businesses or new growth opportunities that can generate attractive returns.  These include selectively increasing our investment in sports programming and in other television, film, and videogame content.  In addition, we will increase capital expenditures in 2010 for key initiatives at parks and resorts, including the expansion of California Adventure at Disneyland Resort, the construction of our new ships at Disney Cruise Lines, as well as new attractions at Walt Disney World and at our parks in Paris and Hong Kong.  We are also willing to pursue acquisitions to the extent we are convinced that they enable us to sustain or build competitive advantage and deliver strong returns. The pending acquisition of Marvel illustrates well the type of opportunity that we believe can utilize our existing strengths to drive future growth from high quality branded content.  Additionally, we expect to continue returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. We purchased only a modest number of our shares during Q4, given constraints imposed by the pending Marvel acquisition. However, we continue to believe our shares remain attractive at current levels and expect to continue our repurchase activity.  Our strong balance sheet and diversified revenue base position us well to successfully navigate through the current economic conditions. More than ever, we are focused on managing with financial discipline while we continue to invest in Disney's brands by creating high quality content and experiences that can be leveraged across our businesses to maximize shareholder value over time. I would also like to thank all of your for your time and interest, not just today but over the last 11 or so years. I will miss my current position but I am excited by the prospect of my new role.  Having worked with Jay for 20 years, I also know that he will do a fantastic job as CFO. As importantly, Jay and I both have the benefit of extraordinarily strong teams within our respective organizations and that gives us great confidence and comfort in our new assignments.  And with that, I will turn the call back to Lowell for Q&A. \nLowell Singer: Okay, thanks, Tom. Operator, we are ready for the first question. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.\nDoug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank : Thanks so much. Well, Tom, it looks like you should start your Chinese and Mandarin lessons right away. I guess -- sort of not a question but from the outside looking in, I would say this positions both you and Jay as potential CEO candidates down the road when Bob decides to hang it up in 10 or 20 years, so I am just curious what advice you gave or would give you Jay, and what advice he might have given to you as you guys trade jobs. \nThomas O. Staggs: Well, I am certainly going to speculate on what the future holds and I know that for the moment, Jay and I are both focused on the roles that we are assuming. As I mentioned in my comments, Jay and I have worked together for 20 years and know each other well and I think that gives us both great confidence in the future for both organizations. I would just also reiterate that because they are such strong organizations in place, that makes this transition that much easier. And so I think that we are both looking forward to it and I don\u2019t -- I think that neither one of us is going far. We\u2019ll both be there to give each other advice as we go and I think that will serve us both well. \nDoug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank : If I could just ask a follow-up, in the movie write-downs for the quarter, was this for only films already released or does this include Rich having a chance to review the prospects for the pipeline?\nThomas O. Staggs: The write-downs that you saw in Q4 are principally for films that have been released to date. There are some film costs for projects that were in the works that we had previously decided to not pursue. However, it does not reflect decisions that Rich has made since the time he took over. That was actually after the balance sheet date.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif-Cohen with Banc of America Merrill Lynch.\nJessica Reif-Cohen - Banc of America Merrill Lynch: Bob, when you think about fiscal year 2010, I was wondering if you could just give us some thoughts about where you think the bigger drivers will be? Will it be revenue and if so, where? And can you discuss the outlook for costs, is there any room for further improvement?  And secondly, how different will the Shanghai theme park be and can you tell us what your share of costs will be and what the expected structure will be? Thanks. \nRobert A. Iger: On the second part of the question, since we have announced that the approval that we got from Beijing will enable us to proceed to conclude a long form agreement or a formal agreement with Shanghai. We have decided with Shanghai not to release any more details about the nature of the park or the nature of the relationship until we conclude the final agreement.  We are in a design and development phase though and are giving considerable thought to what the park will look like and we will work closely with our partners in Shanghai in that regard, particularly once the agreement is finalized.  In terms of levers both on the cost side and on the revenue side for 2010, Tom cited some. Certainly on the movie side we are really excited about The Princess and the Frog and Alice in Wonderland, Toy Story 3, Prince of Persia, and so you can expect that the titles that we have coming into the marketplace for 2010 should outperform some of the title we have in 2009 but the DVD release of a number of those titles won't come until the next fiscal year, so we won't benefit full from that.  We are going to watch obviously very carefully results in our parks, although if you look back to prior economic downturns, we tended to lag recovery a big. That tends to do in part with just the way vacations are planned. We are hopeful that we will see a strengthening economy and therefore a strengthening business but as Tom also mentioned, we don\u2019t have great visibility there. I\u2019d say the biggest area in terms of revenue, potential revenue improvement for fiscal 2010 will come on the advertising front, where Tom mentioned that sales are generally good at our media networks for the quarter that we are currently in. Again, we are not making any predictions formally about the rest of the year. We are taking more of a cautious approach and with that in mind, because visibility is still somewhat limited, although signs are encouraging, we are continuing to proceed in terms of our vigilance on the cost perspective as though this is going to be a challenging economy and environment for basically the duration of the year.  I had the chance to speak with a few of our theme park executives this morning and they talked pretty aggressively about continuing to look at costs and I think that is a prudent thing to do. And as I said, we will see exactly how the year progresses.  I also want to remind you that there are some sports rights issues from the comparison perspective that we will deal with in fiscal 2010, the purchase of English Premiere League, for instance, will have an impact on ESPN and as you know, we are investing in a fair amount of initiatives that are designed to create long-term growth and the cost of some of those initiatives will also kick in in 2010. A lot of that comes on the parks and resorts front with our cruise ships and the expansions that we have mentioned and some of it is in some other businesses as well, although the dominant expense increase comes on the parks and resorts front, particularly in an area like cruise, for instance, where there will be increased spending as the year progresses but since the boat won't be launched until fiscal 2011, we won't see the benefit of that and the revenue coming in until fiscal 11.  So we are looking at a year that at least at the beginning is showing some potential signs of improvement but I want to emphasize that visibility is somewhat limited and we are going to continue to address the cost side, particularly with the economy being somewhat uncertain. \nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.\nSpencer Wang - Credit Suisse : I just wanted to ask one question on the park margins and cost structure -- it looks like costs were down about 4% or so for the full year and I recognize that some part of the cost structure is variable but just given the pension costs that, Tom, that you mentioned, if revenues at parks are kind of flat to maybe up a little bit in 2010, how should we think about the cost growth in that context? Thanks. \nThomas O. Staggs: We have discussed a little bit the nature of the actions on costs that the parks have taken in the year and really the bulk of it was designed to be the kind of thing, the kind of cost cuts that were structural and that could be sustained. And so I think that bodes well for us.  Now, getting something like half of this increase in the pension and post retirement medical costs, that clearly is going to have an impact on margins versus where they would otherwise be. I would also say that this is a group that consistently looks for efficiency and productivity measures but at the same time, some of the actions that we have taken over the last year are in the way of cost deferral and so as time goes on, some of those will find their back into the cost base, including to a certain extent, in 2010. A good part of the employee base did not take raises in 2009, et cetera. There were certain park hours that were trimmed back that we will have to take a look at in the context of the overall demand.  So there is a chunk of it that is variable and it will come back in. There is a portion of the cost savings that are permanent but there is also a portion that I expect will resume some upward pressure on growth just as time goes by in the natural course of things. \nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with J.P. Morgan.\nScott Davis - J.P. Morgan: My question is you mentioned that you expect further ad improvement at ESPN and I know you don\u2019t want to give guidance but maybe you could just give us some things to think about because I\u2019m looking at it and saying well, ratings look like they are just doing really well, scatter pricing is improving, auto is picking up and I think NASCAR has been a bit of a drag. So I am just trying to figure out the trajectory of how all those dynamics play themselves out -- I mean, recognizing there would be difficult comps in the last year with the loss of the extra week. Is there anything else I should be thinking about?\nRobert A. Iger: The numbers for ESPN from a ratings perspective, as you mentioned, Scott and as Tom and I both addressed, are fantastic. They had -- they\u2019ve just had a great quarter and the numbers continue to be strong. And that is obviously impacting them from a sales perspective, aided by a marketplace that is definitely showing some signs of recovery. But not only won't we give guidance, ESPN would be the first to admit that while they are experiencing a strong market now, there is still no guarantee that will continue and we would prefer not to predict that it will.  They are seeing strength across multiple sectors. You mentioned automotive, men\u2019s grooming is up, insurance is strong, there\u2019s good business from the movie studios, retail also very strong. Those are all good signs.  The other thing that is interesting is that ESPN's strength in ratings and the marketplace in general in terms of avails, particularly in primetime, is getting ESPN to compete for dollars beyond sports dollars and that\u2019s a pretty unique position for a sports cable network to be in, and a position that ESPN has not found itself in very often in the past. And so it is clear that the investment that ESPN has made in its programming and the strengthening of its brand is having an interesting impact not just on the ratings but on the way ESPN is perceived from a marketplace perspective.  The other thing I want to add that is also encouraging, and I realize I am going to caveat all of this by saying again no guidance and don\u2019t necessarily take this to the bank for the whole year, but ESPN is showing some really encouraging growth on the digital front. Both their dot.com performance, their mobile performance, also their ESPN 360 is all improving and they are turning that into advertising revenue as well.  A small example, but there are 4 million downloads of the score center app on the iPhone and of those 4 million downloads, 2 million of those users are using score center regularly and it is advertiser supported and so it started to generate some real revenues, small when you compare it to the total but some pretty encouraging signs in terms of digital advertising growth there as well. \nThomas O. Staggs: The only thing I would add is when you think about it, what ESPN has been doing is continuing to build out its position, so Bob mentioned ESPN 360 where subscribers have more than doubled in the past year. Similarly, ESPN new subscribers have more than doubled in the past year and so these other businesses that they have been quietly building I think bode well for ESPN's future and for their overall position. So we are encouraged by the near-term signs that we are seeing, as Bob said, but we are also feeling good about how they are positioning and investing for the long-term. \nScott Davis - J.P. Morgan: And the one thing I mentioned that you guys didn\u2019t comment on or take the bait on is NASCAR, so I\u2019m assuming that that\u2019s been a drag that is going to go away by the end of November -- is that a fair characterization?\nRobert A. Iger: Well, you are right -- they had some softness in their advertising and in their ratings for NASCAR and I guess when the season ends, they will obviously turn to doing what they can working with NASCAR to strengthen both the ratings and advertising for next season. \nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of Michael Morris with UBS.\nMichael Morris - UBS: So retransmission consent and getting paid for the broadcast networks and stations is a topic that has been around for a while but it is certainly heating up lately. I\u2019m wondering if you can give us an update on your thoughts -- you have fewer stations, of course, but still a pretty sizable footprint. Is seeking compensation for your network content through retransmission something that you are looking to explore and is it something you would rather do at the network level or at the station level? And then just one other thing -- Bob, you talked about with a little more emphasis I feel like on this call the need for vigilance around protecting IP as broadband penetration increases. Is that something that you are kind of stepping up and can you speak to any significance to comments on this call versus prior calls? Thanks. \nRobert A. Iger: Well, on the piracy front, it\u2019s definitely something that we are more interested in and more worried about and as we watch with great interest growth and penetration of high speed broadband connectivity not just in the United States but in markets across the globe, it\u2019s clear that while that creates some real opportunity for us in terms of robust means of distributing our content to consumers on new platforms, it also I believe raises the threat in terms of piracy and in certain markets, South Korea is a great example, where broadband connectivity at really high speed is ubiquitous, the piracy issue is far greater. And I think that while this industry has talked a lot about piracy as an issue and has done certain things, needs very much to galvanize around this issue as probably not only its biggest threat but one of its most critical and important strategies going into the future. And we are at the table with others in the industry looking for solutions, attempting to create a cohesive approach and really trying to attack this on a multiple or multi-layer -- in a multi-layer way.  And I think it\u2019s -- the most important thing usually in dealing with a threat is to recognize its existence and so our articulation of this issue is in part designed to do just that.  On the retransmission front, look, we have 10 great stations and a very successful network and have long believed that the value that those stations and network creates not only for consumers but for multi-channel providers is significant, and we are intent on getting paid marketplace prices or fair market value, I should say, for those stations and that network. We\u2019ve had a good relationship with multi-channel providers over the years that have created great value for us and paid us well, just as while they have been paying us well, we\u2019ve been continuing to increase value for them by investing in our programming and our brands -- ESPN is probably the best example of that but Disney Channel, ABC Family, we could name a bunch.  We obviously are watching very carefully the dynamic in the marketplace about retransmission consent and fully expect to participate in the trend, however it goes, and continue to work as closely as we possibly can with multi-channel providers to not only derive value and preserve and protect shareholder value for us but to make sure that the business, the business model of multi-channel service continues to create real value -- very, very important for us. \nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citigroup.\nJason Bazinet - Citigroup: I just have a question on the ESPN deferral for Mr. Staggs -- maybe I have this wrong, I always thought the number is sort of chewed up between what you deferred and what you recognize for the year, and I had a deferral last year of -- or a recognition in Q4 of last year of 396 and was sort of expecting something less than that in this quarter that you reported. Can you just elaborate on that a bit?\nThomas O. Staggs: Sure, the number that we said, the 128, is the net differential in the deferred revenues that were recognized in this quarter versus the number or the amount of deferred revenues in the prior year quarter. So as I recall, we were -- as you mentioned, 396 or something like that in the fourth quarter last year, so we recognized net deferred revenues of $128 million more than that in this year. And that is driven by primarily the normal increase in subscriber rates.  Now, it was also driven this year by a difference in the timing of the recognition -- in other words, there was a key threshold that we met in Q3 of last year that we met in Q4 of this year, so that made the differentials in Q4 that much larger. But the differential for the year by and large is only going to reflect the change in rates. There\u2019s a very small anomaly this year that has to do with the 53rd week because the calendars for accounting for us don\u2019t sync up exactly what the calendars for the contracts, and so there is a small amount of revenues that were in the 53rd week that were deferred that will in fact be recognized in 2010. But that is less than $10 million. \nJason Bazinet - Citigroup: Okay, and do you mind if I just ask one follow-up? Can you just elaborate a bit just on the operating income losses at the interactive segment? In other words, I would sort of think that that -- that most of the revenues that were generated there were sort of paid for in some other part of the ecosystem and therefore it sort of generate smaller losses or gains. \nThomas O. Staggs: Well, there\u2019s -- \nJason Bazinet - Citigroup: -- of the [graphic display] market that we are in?\nThomas O. Staggs: Well, no, there\u2019s two things to think about in this regard in the interactive media group. Right now we are making an investment in videogames and that takes place there, and we\u2019ve talked about the fact that we are investing there, we are currently in a loss situation. It\u2019s something that we would like to see over the next few years reverse itself as we build out to scale in that business, so that\u2019s going on there.  On the other side, you\u2019ve got the online business and the multiplayer games business and in that, I think that arguably there is some of that activity which is marketing other parts of the business in Disney in general, so surely that -- a portion of the loss there is in the efforts to better market our properties broadly.  But if you look at the online business, we have continued to see growth in advertising revenue there, especially in the video side of the equation, and we\u2019ve also seen nice growth in the MMOG business driven by Club Penguin, where the subscribers have grown quite nicely. So that\u2019s really how you break down the business and what is driving that. \nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with Sanford Bernstein.\nMichael Nathanson - Sanford C. Bernstein: I have a couple -- let me start with Tom first, and congratulations to you, too. Tom, in the past few calls, you have talked about weakness in the licensing business and I just wonder how that market is looking right now and is perhaps your content cycle helping that market? And then what has been the reaction of your licensing partners to the Marvel deal and how are those conversations going?\nThomas O. Staggs: The licensing business, I would say this -- I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we didn\u2019t really see the full effect of the downturn until we got to the beginning of calendar 2009. And so that is still going on in the backdrop, so on a relative basis we still see some year-over-year softness there. Also, even though I think we\u2019ve seen some encouraging news on the advertising that Bob cited, et cetera, this holiday period of course, much of it was determined by the extent to which people were ready to place orders over the last few months and so that is going to impact us to a certain extent.  Now, the question is what will come in terms of re-orders or the pace of that, et cetera. And so that remains to be seen. But the content cycle I would say we discussed a little bit of softness due to tough comparisons to Hannah Montana and High School Musical. Now as we look forward, I like the trend in the content cycle, I like the refresh that is going on there, Toy Story being first and foremost but also some of these other properties that we have high hopes for and it would be interesting to see whether we continue to grow Fairies, which we like to do. We have The Princess and the Frog, which is another Princess to add to that lineup, which as I think you know is an important set of franchises for us.  Cars coming a little bit later on, another year down the road and Cars of course has been one of our most important franchises and the prospect of a sequel to that film really bodes well, so we like the way the content cycle is going from here.  Marvel clearly is an augmentation of that overall and I don\u2019t know that we have any specific reaction from licensees at this point but I think that as Bob said earlier, as we\u2019ve gotten closer to it we think the prospects for Marvel are at least as good as we thought at the time that we entered into the transaction. \nRobert A. Iger: You\u2019re right -- we haven\u2019t gotten much direct reaction other than to hear from certain licensees just how much interest there is out there both in the U.S. and in international markets about Marvel properties and there is real excitement about the films that they have coming up, or that are being made by others, including Iron Man 2 and another sequel to Spider-man and some of the other properties that they have in the marketplace.  We think it is going to be a great opportunity for us down the road and we are excited about it. \nMichael Nathanson - Sanford C. Bernstein: Bob, can I just ask a question -- let me follow-up on something different -- in the past week you are starting to see some real discounting at retail for new Blu-Ray and DVD discs and as someone and as your company who invests in premium content and premium brands, I wonder how do you respond, how do you view the heavy discounting going on at retail for DVDs? And does Disney have anything in their deals that precludes that kind of discounting that could possibly hurt some of the franchises that you have invested in?\nRobert A. Iger: Well first of all, no, the pricing is determined by retailers, not by us. We sell them our goods and they determine how to price. And as we have seen in the past, typically when they discount, they discount -- on new titles, anyway, they create traffic and there are some good titles in the marketplace to use to do that. However, there is discounting beyond new releases, particularly on library product and I think that is a sign of what we have been talking about, which is both downturn in the economy and also a real secular change in the business.  One of the interesting things, by the way, is in talking with our home video guys, in prior economic downturns, library typically held up better than new release products and this time around they are finding that library is down as well, which suggests to us that some of the secular change that we are seeing might be evidencing itself in how library is being sold.  It\u2019s pretty interesting -- it\u2019s a pretty interesting trend and we continue to believe that there is just greater competition from people\u2019s time and money in the marketplace, just more things for people to do. We don\u2019t see people building libraries as much as they did when DVD came along after VHS. A lot of those libraries have already been built and it causes us to really reconsider not only what we are investing in our films but how we market and how we distribute them. All the changes we made in the studio are indicative of concerns we have about the marketplace that go beyond just the economy. They are not temporary. \nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Two questions -- one on cable margins, which came in better than expected, or at least on my end, this quarter. I think there was a [Jetex] rebrand and also the U.K. launch -- can you just help us -- I don\u2019t know, Tom, if you can quantify how much those two buckets were in the quarter and whether those two continue on into 1Q.  And then on the film side, I wanted to ask about Christmas Carol and then Pirates 4 -- what is your reaction to Christmas Carol box office numbers so far? How do you think about 3D in that movie and future holiday periods, and what is the timing on Pirates 4?\nRobert A. Iger: I\u2019ll take the question about Pirates 4 and Christmas Carol. First of all, on Pirates 4, we are close to naming a director. Johnny Depp is very much on board and we expect to be commencing shooting with Pirates 4 sometime in the Spring, and so that is all good news.  On Christmas Carol, we believe we have a good film. We would be remiss if we said we were elated with the results this past weekend. We actually would have liked it to have done better but it is early in the season. We were very encouraged by the numbers yesterday. It did $5.3 million in the United States. It was Veteran\u2019s Day but it\u2019s an interesting sign. There are many examples of Christmas films coming out in the early November period that have played extremely well for longer periods of time as you near the Christmas holiday and we hope that this film follows that pattern. Also, the cinema score or the result from people who saw this film in 3D was quite positive and in fact much more positive than people who saw it in 2D -- not that the people who saw it in 2D didn\u2019t like it, but the people who saw it in 3D liked it even more. And we are fortunate that even though there is some competition come in the marketplace, we think we will have a pretty good hold on 3D screens, at least until Avatar comes out in I guess mid-December.  So this was a costly film and obviously that has to be taken into account and it got off to a slightly slower start the first weekend than we would have liked, but we are continuing to spend in the marketplace to support this and as I mentioned, we are pretty encouraged by what we saw yesterday. \nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: If I can just quickly follow-up, are there any plans with Christmas Carol on the home video front that you might go to market differently? I mean, some questions around sort of 2D -- obviously you don\u2019t have 3D in the homes. I don\u2019t know if you think about the marketing there or how you go to market or what your retail position is or using digital downloads -- is there anything different with this film, given the unique nature of it?\nRobert A. Iger: The only thing that is different about this is that we are going to go to the market much later and wait until Christmas next year instead of putting it out for President\u2019s Weekend or Easter. I was going to say Passover but that would have been a bad joke.  We like 3D in the home, by the way, but I think it is going to take a while for that technology to penetrate but the demonstrations we have seen are pretty compelling but it is way too early to predict or indicate just how far that will go and how valuable it will be. We do believe that when made right and for the right film, 3D offers the moviegoer a better experience which is reflected in the pricing and reflected in the reaction we are getting from moviegoers. And when you see a film like this in 3D, it is a very good way to appreciate the technology because I think it is quite compelling. \nThomas O. Staggs: With regard to cable margins, if you look at -- let\u2019s look at the year as a whole, for a second, and then we can talk about the quarter. The year as a whole, we saw a nice growth at ABC Family. ESPN, despite the difficult ad environment, was able to maintain margins roughly and in fact they did maintain margins, but we did have this crossover from [Jetex] to XD and in some instances, Disney Channel and there were some costs associated with that. And so what you are left with is really the key driver of growth here was ESPN.  But in the quarter itself, the lion\u2019s share of the costs for the changeover had been earlier in the year, so we had some of that left and we are pretty much through that part of the equation and so that helped the quarter. I thought ESPN had an impressive performance and now clearly the deferral from -- of revenues, affiliate revenues helped us in that regard but given the fact that they also absorbed some start-up losses in England from the new service, ESPN over there, I thought that they turned in a strong performance and that overall is probably one of the biggest things that might have lead to a beat versus what you had expected, although having not looked at your model, I can't tell you for sure.  And here again, the Disney Channel worldwide in the quarter also saw some margin expansion, in part because of the 53rd week but overall, good performance. \nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of David Miller with Caris & Company.\nDavid Miller - Caris & Company: Tom, two questions for you -- first of all, what was attendance at Disneyland and Disney World including the extra week? I apologize if you said it and I missed it. And then also, obviously over the last 20 years or so, lateral movement of senior executives at Disney is nothing new. I am wondering why you chose to go the way of the Parks and what opportunity you see to sort of make your mark at the parks that maybe Jay Rizzulo has not made. Thanks. \nThomas O. Staggs: Well, I\u2019ll tell you, I am getting the chance to go over to the Parks at time when they have a very exciting period in front of them, in large measure because of the leadership Jay has shown over the last seven years there, and so my goal is to go in there, get down the learning curve as quickly as I can and hopefully continue a lot of the great work that Jay has put in place. So that is what I am focused on right now.  By the way, to your first question, Disneyland was up 23% including the 53rd week and Walt Disney World was up 5% including the 53rd week.\nRobert A. Iger: I want to make sure you understand -- I didn\u2019t give Tom a multiple choice in terms of where he was going to go, and I made both Tom and Jay offers that I felt they couldn\u2019t refuse. I also had the benefit with Tom and Jay of two executives that I thought would thrive in their new changed positions and they were also both very right from a timing perspective to market his move, having been in their current positions for quite a long period of time. And so I have great confidence in both of them obviously and their ability to accept and thrive in their new roles. But again, they weren\u2019t multiple choices -- these were kind of perfect for both of them and having benefited myself from being given new opportunities over the years, in some cases going to places and businesses I had not been in, I think I can particularly appreciate what a real opportunity this is for both of them and long-term what a great opportunity it is for the company not only to provide these two executives with new and different challenges and responsibilities, but to continue to do that for other executives, as we just did with Rich Ross, who had spent a career in television and as we did with -- 20 years back when we gave someone who had been in cable broadcasting responsibility and we recently moved an executive around Latin America to run Europe, et cetera and so on. And this is a unique move in many respects because of its significance, given the importance of these jobs but it\u2019s not necessarily the first time we\u2019ve done this, as you cited, and it won't be the last time that we do it. \nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi with Standard Import Group. \nTuna Amobi - Standard Import Group:   I\u2019ve got a few questions as well -- I guess the first one, it seems like you got a pretty good bump, attendance bump from the promotions and with regard to your decision to extend it, I think you said March and April next year for the two domestic parks, can you talk about a thought process with that and why you kind of decided to -- it seems like the Easter holiday weekend falls in between those two dates for the -- extension dates for those two parks so I was kind of -- I wanted to get a sense about the thought process there and why you decided to end them on different dates.  And secondly, I think Bob, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the sports right and I don\u2019t recall -- I didn\u2019t hear you mention the Olympics South American rights, which it seemed like you just picked up for 2010 Vancouver and 2012 London Olympics. Can you talk about that in terms of the costs that you might expect to incur in 2010 and beyond associated with those rights? And does that kind of [inaudible] kind of a wider Olympic bid? And lastly, just a quick question on your [key chest] initiative and how that kind of dovetails into your studio marketing changes that you just announced. Any color there would be helpful. Thank you very much. \nRobert A. Iger: Wow, Tuna -- I\u2019m sorry. I have to go to school to learn all that. \nTuna Amobi - Standard Import Group:   Hopefully they are quick.\nRobert A. Iger: First of all, Olympics -- ESPN has continued to look opportunistically at picking up rights for sporting events that they could distribute to markets outside the United States. They have done a good job of that. They distribute a lot of U.S. based sports to international markets -- recently the World Series is a good example of that. They had an opportunity to buy the rights to these upcoming Olympic Games in London to distribute on their Latin American channel. It\u2019s a very, very modest investment and I won't get into specifics but it\u2019s not material by any stretch of the imagination.  The discounting at the parks in terms of process, first of all I believe that the Easter holiday falls outside of the window to extend the discounting. The parks spent a fair amount of time watching the marketplace very carefully and waiting before they essentially implemented or extended a discount and also spent a fair amount of time figuring out exactly what the discount should be. And they ultimately concluded that the marketplace warranted maintaining the promotional offer because obviously the marketplace wasn\u2019t responding as much as it would have liked when we didn\u2019t have a discount in place. The point Tom made about bookings trends, booking trends have actually picked up significantly since we announced the discount and they had been somewhat sluggish before we did. This has been the case in the past as well. We look at this very carefully. I would like to emphasize that in the past, when we have had discounts we have not had a problem weaning consumers of the discount and as economic conditions improved in the past, we\u2019ve managed to maintain volume while reducing or removing the discount. I also want to point out that the discount that we have in the marketplace today is slightly less of a discount than the discount we had in the marketplace the last few quarters by a little bit, both on the room and ticket side but also on the dining side, where it\u2019s been changed somewhat. And by the way, the marketplace has reacted very well to it.  There is also a strategic value to discounting and maintaining volume as we see it, in that the park experience that we provide is unique and special. Guest experience and the research that we do suggests that people who come, love it. That improves return visitation, as well as extends word of mouth and that is a very valuable part of our marketing process. And so when the marketplace basically warrants discounting, we believe that it is a good thing for us to do, even though it results in slightly less revenue. Maintaining volume is very important.  On key chest, I won't get into too much detail there but what we are really trying to do here is serve the consumer with technology that we are helping to develop by basically giving consumer an ability to buy something once and then watch it on multiple platforms and devices and not face a lack of interoperability, not face barriers of basically managing IP that they have bought in a way that makes it much less attractive to buy. It\u2019s really -- it\u2019s a complicated technology but the premise is as simple as that.  It\u2019s really taking a look at the big picture from a consumer perspective and the consumer faces a somewhat daunting task when they make a decision to buy something digitally because often what they buy is not portable to other platforms. \nTuna Amobi - Standard Import Group:   Would that be your answer to the TV everywhere, would you say?\nRobert A. Iger: Well, there\u2019s a yes and no to that. Look, TV everywhere is maybe an example of what we have talked about often, and that is digital technology providing us with more opportunities to reach consumers and consumers more opportunities to consume our product. And to the extent that TV everywhere serves consumers better, we are in favor of it. However, when you serve consumers better, when you provide more convenience or more utility, you should be able to charge for that and charge an appropriate amount. And some of what we have heard about TV everywhere suggests that interest in charging the consumer for greater access is not necessarily a priority and we believe it should be.  We also believe that we should still have the ability if we go to a world where there is authentication and TV everywhere for the multi-channel subscriber, we should not be precluded from offering our product directly to consumers who may not be subscribers to multi-channel services, because we believe that would -- and even though there aren\u2019t many of them, that wouldn\u2019t necessarily be good for consumers and while we realize we are trying to serve many masters, the master that is most important to serve for us is the consumer. \nLowell Singer: Tuna, thanks. Operator, we have time for one more question. \nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen & Company.\nDoug Creutz - Cowen & Company: I was wondering if you could talk about your distribution deal with DreamWorks and what we could see from them in the coming fiscal year. Thanks. \nRobert A. Iger: Probably very little in the coming fiscal year because they are really just gearing up in terms of not only their development but their production. \nThomas O. Staggs: Vis-\u00e0-vis our deal. \nRobert A. Iger: Exactly, so I think it is possible we will have one film in 2010, although that is not a guarantee, and they will start to hit in 2011. We still feel really good about this relationship. We are certainly encouraged by what we see in their development pipeline and certainly have great faith in their executives and we thought this was a great way to use our distribution infrastructure to increase our revenue and to grow our company without a significant capital investment. \nLowell Singer: Thank you, Doug.

Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to the Walt Disney Company's third quarter 2009 earnings call. Our press release was issued a few minutes ago. It\u2019s now available on our website. Today\u2019s call is also being also be webcast and the webcast will also be available on our website, which is www.disney.com/investors. After the call, a replay and a transcript of today\u2019s remarks will be available on our website.  Joining me in Burbank today are Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Staggs, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob and Tom are going to lead off with some brief comments and then we will happily take all of your questions.  So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob and we will get started. \nRobert A. Iger: Thank you, Lowell and good afternoon. While the challenging global economy impacted our performance in the quarter, we remain encouraged by the relative strength of our businesses. The Disney brand continues to differentiate us in the global marketplace. Our business strategy with its emphasis on creativity, technology, and international expansion to grow shareholder value is working. And we have proven our commitment to making our operations more efficient while preserving quality. We do see signs of economic stabilization but the pace and strength of recovery remain uncertain and we are managing accordingly.  At our movie studio, UP is an artistic triumph and a big commercial success around the world with many important international markets yet to open, and we are very enthusiastic about our upcoming animated films, The Princess and the Frog and Toy Story 3. Like UP, these films embody the strengths of classic Disney movies -- solid storytelling, memorable characters, wonderful artistry, and heartfelt emotion. And on the live action front, Disney's A Christmas Carol, Alice in Wonderland, and Prince of Persia to be amazing movies by visionary filmmakers that display great creativity with cutting edge technology.  Our media networks also performed well during the quarter, despite the tough economic environment. ESPN maintains its strong appeal across multiple platforms, solidifying its status as the number one media destination for sports fans. And Disney Channel delivered impressive ratings growth during the quarter and continues to find and develop new talent and creative franchises that benefit many of our businesses.  We are also very excited by ABC\u2019s fall schedule with drama Flash Forward and comedy Modern Family already winning critical acclaim and potentially adding to our slate of proven hits like Dancing with the Stars, Desperate Housewives, Grey\u2019s Anatomy, and Lost, which enters its sixth and final cliff-hanger of a season. Although its yet to conclude, we are comfortable with how this year\u2019s advertising up-front is playing out and I\u2019ll let Tom fill in the details.  Our parks and resorts have clearly been impacted by the weak economy. We\u2019ve sought to sustain attendance through a number of promotions that offer great value to families and we\u2019ve sought to reduce costs while continuing to offer an exceptional guest experience. And over 3 million people signed up to enjoy our birthday at our parks through the what will you celebrate? campaign. I am proud of what we have been able to do, the strong levels of attendance and great guest satisfaction in our parks during this period underscore the tremendous affinity customers and consumers have for Disney.  Throughout this period, we\u2019ve been mindful of the need to invest in our future while sticking to the strategic priorities we\u2019ve followed over the last three years. I am pleased to say we\u2019ve concluded an agreement to expand Hong Kong Disneyland, adding unique and compelling attractions that we believe will draw more visitors and keep them staying longer.  Work is also well underway on the expansion of Disney's California Adventure, on our two new cruise ships, and on our Hawaiian resort. We are also pursuing new opportunities. After a successful test in Chicago, ESPN is aggressively expanding local coverage to serve sports fans in several major cities, including New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas.  In Europe, ESPN has substantially enhanced its profile by purchasing rights to English and Scottish Premiere League Football matches.  Our opportunity to grow obviously extends to online platforms. We have ample evidence from both traditional and new media that people are willing to pay for quality, to pay for choice, and to pay for convenience and they are willing to pay for what they perceive as value. And we are developing services that meet these criteria using the amazing range of entertainment content we\u2019ve created over the years.  We will continue to look for ways to substantially grow our businesses and to build long-term shareholder value, even as we manage through this downturn. And any investment we make must promote our brand strategy, add to our offerings of high quality content and experiences, and be relevant across technological platforms as well as geographical and cultural boundaries.  It\u2019s a challenging time marked by rapid technological change and economic dislocation but I like the way we are positioned and I like the opportunities it presents to companies like Disney that have a clear strategic focus, that embrace innovation, and aren\u2019t afraid of change.  And with that, I will turn things over to Tom. \nThomas O. Staggs:   Thanks, Bob and good afternoon, everyone. Before we turn to your questions, I will discuss the key factors that drove last quarter\u2019s results and some of the trends in our businesses.  Operating results for the studio were off considerably this quarter. Home video sales were down as this year\u2019s new releases did not match those in last year\u2019s Q3, which included National Treasure 2 and Enchanted.  We also recognized lower net revenue per unit in home video this quarter, driven largely by shifts in our product line-up and distribution channel mix.  Across the home video industry this year, transactions appear to be down modestly due to lower sell-through volume, partially offset by an increase in rental and VOD transactions.  Our TV distribution revenue for Q3 declined in the face of a relatively stronger slate of titles last year. At the same time, we are extremely pleased with the theatrical performance of UP and The Proposal.  At our consumer products segment, the economy continues to impact our licensing and Disney Store results. The difficult environment, coupled with very tough comparisons in our tween properties, High School Musical and Hannah Montana, resulted in Q3 earned licensing royalties being down by approximately 14% versus the prior year. Our results at Disney Stores North America reflected a full quarter of operations compared to the prior Q3, which only included two months of ownership.  At interactive media, revenues were somewhat lower due to the difficult comparison to the Narnia videogame last year but lower marketing and product development costs helped lead to better results for the quarter.  We noted last quarter that we were seeing signs of stabilization in the ad market and that continues to be the case as reflected in our Q3 results at media networks. The local ad market remains soft, resulting in a 26% decline at our TV stations in Q3, which is consistent with the trends we saw last quarter.  Ad sales at the ABC Network were down by mid-single-digit percentage points compared to prior year, driven in part by lower ratings. As anticipated, programming production costs at ABC were up versus last year\u2019s Q3 due to the timing of pilot development write-offs and more scripted programming in the current year, given last year\u2019s writers\u2019 strike. These higher costs were partially offset by increased international sales of our shows.  The timing of affiliate revenue recognition at ESPN was a key driver of our results at cable networks. Revenue recognition for a portion of our affiliate fees is dependent on when we fulfill covenants related to the quantity of live sports programming.  Last year, we achieved certain programming commitment levels during our third fiscal quarter. This year, we reached those levels early in the fourth quarter. As a result, we had an effective year-over-year increase in net affiliate revenue deferrals for Q3 of $116 million.  We will recognize all previously deferred revenues for the fiscal year by the end of Q4.  Excluding this deferral, our cable networks continued to perform relatively well this quarter as higher affiliate rates and subscriber growth at ESPN, the Disney Channel, and ABC Family would more than offset lower advertising revenue. ESPN\u2019s ad sales trends were generally consistent with what we saw in the first half of our year, due to continued softness in several categories, particularly automotive and financial services.  Ad revenue was impacted somewhat by our airing four fewer NBA playoff games in Q3 this year compared to last year. On a comparable basis, ESPN\u2019s Q3 ad revenues were just under 10% below last year.  As Bob noted, we continue to invest in ESPN on a local, national, and international level. We have new rights deals starting in Q4 for college football and for the United States Tennis Open. Additionally, our new deals for Premiere League rights in both England and Scotland will commence in Q4, which betters our position in this important market but also will impact our costs as we build that business.  While advertising trends appear to have stabilized across our media networks, ad buyers continue to make decisions and place orders closer to the date their ads run. As Bob mentioned, we are still in the midst of the up-front process and we are comfortable with the rates ABC has been achieving. At the same time, we anticipate selling less of our inventory in this year\u2019s up-front than in recent years. Given the strength of our programming and the fact that some major advertisers remain on the sidelines in this up-front, we expect to be well-positioned for the scatter market.  At parks and resorts, our promotional activities helped drive strong attendance at our domestic parks despite they challenging environment. The promotions also resulted in higher room and admissions discounting which, together with softer guest spending, impacted our operating income in Q3.  Attendance at our domestic parks was up 3%, helped by the favourable timing of the Easter break. Walt Disney World attendance was flat to prior year while Disneyland was up 10%. We estimate that the Easter shift added approximately 3 percentage points to our combined domestic parks attendance.  Overall, per capita guest spending at our domestic parks came in 6% lower than Q3 last year.  Hotel occupancy in Orlando was 91%, which is actually within about a half a percentage point of last year\u2019s Q3, driven partly by the buy four, get three free promotion.  In Anaheim, occupancy came in at 83%, down by 8 percentage points. Per room spending at our domestic resorts decreased by 9%.  At our international parks, lower guest spending and hotel occupancy at Disneyland Paris drove a decrease in operating income.  Our parks operating team has continued to do a good job of offsetting a portion of our revenue declines by reducing costs. There\u2019s a limit to those opportunities, given the relatively high volume of business we\u2019ve been achieving but we will continue to carefully evaluate and act on opportunities for efficiency while ensuring that our guests get the great experience they have come to expect from Disney's parks and resorts.  Looking ahead, room reservations at our domestic resorts for Q4 are up slightly compared to last year. As you know, our fiscal Q4 includes an extra week this year due to our accounting calendar. If we exclude the impact of the extra week, Q4 bookings are running about 7% behind last year.  As we stated in the past, the economic downturn does not change our fundamental strategy. We are striving to closely manage our costs and will continue to do so. At the same time, we are focused on executing against our long-term strategy and identifying opportunities to invest in high quality branded content and initiatives with strong potential to grow our diverse set of businesses around the world.  And with that, I\u2019ll turn back to Lowell for your questions. \nLowell Singer: Okay, thanks. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the first question. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jessica Reif-Cohen of Banc of America Merrill Lynch.\nJessica Reif-Cohen - Banc of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. You guys have really impressive margins at the theme parks and I know, Tom, you said there\u2019s a limit to how much you can cut but I was wondering -- I mean, you do have another promotion coming up and I was wondering if you could at least discuss the difference in economics between the dining promotion and the buy four, get three free? And then just talk about where we can expect margins to go over the foreseeable future. \nThomas O. Staggs: Sure. The fact is that the parks folks are obviously in an ongoing effort to make sure that they are managing costs as closely as possible. Now, a number of the efforts that they have made and they have focused really on what we call back-of-house that should be sustainable cost increases but some of them have to do with what the park hours are, the hotel rooms that are open, et cetera.  So they will continue to go through that process but that did mitigate the potential margin decline in the quarter to a decent extent.  I wouldn\u2019t highlight a dramatic difference between the dine free promotion versus the buy four get three free, either in terms of percentage discount or sort of bottom line impact. The fact is both have been successful for us and they both work well and we will use them and any potential future promotions sort of as we see the market unfold, so those decisions we\u2019ll continue to make based on what we see in the environment. \nJessica Reif-Cohen - Banc of America Merrill Lynch: Just one question to Bob -- it seems like you are investing heavily in your brands in your different businesses. Can we take that to mean that as a company, right now you are more focused on builds versus a buy strategy?\nRobert A. Iger: Well, we are definitely focused on a build strategy and the buy strategy remains the same. We look opportunistically for the right assets at the right price at the right time and I will just leave it at that. I don\u2019t preclude the possibility, of course, but it has to be the right fit at the right time and the right price. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, Jessica. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Spencer Wang of Credit Suisse.\nSpencer Wang - Credit Suisse: Good afternoon. Just a question on ESPN and the advertising performance there -- I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit about if the advertising performance got better or worse over the course of the quarter, remained the same? And then can you also maybe speak to how ESPN is pacing for the September quarter?  And then one quick housekeeping question, maybe for Tom -- can you just size the film write-downs in the quarter at the studio? Thank you. \nThomas O. Staggs: ESPN ad performance, the market has been pretty much as we described -- relatively stable. I haven\u2019t noted -- we haven\u2019t noted a dramatic change either in terms of what categories are weak or strong or what the overall market looks like. I would say that as it regards Q3 versus Q2, I think Q4 looks right now a lot like Q3, so we don\u2019t see dramatic shifts. Bob noted at the outset that we continue to see the signs of stabilization overall in the businesses but that it\u2019s a little early for us to call signs of a recovery, or to make any predictions about the pace of that. \nRobert A. Iger: And buying patterns continue to be late, meaning advertisers are buying closer to the time that their money is going to be expressed and that has certainly been the case in the quarter that we are in, where it solidified as the quarter has progressed. Now part of that is a function of the fact that a lot of what ESPN is out selling is football and that commences in a relatively short period of time. \nThomas O. Staggs: You asked about studio costs in the quarter, the -- other than what we said, the one thing I would note is that we had a very strong opening of G-FORCE last weekend, which is obviously something that came shortly after the end of last quarter, and in fact it\u2019s been doing very, very well in the mid-week, so we are actually gratified. It\u2019s a quality film and it\u2019s been very well-received.  It\u2019s also a very expensive film and some of the costs of G-FORCE do show up in Q3 results because of that, and it\u2019s nothing we broke out and quantified but the fact is that if you are seeing extra costs, some of those would be associated with G-FORCE versus what you might have expected. \nSpencer Wang - Credit Suisse: And you took those in the June quarter, Tom, just to be clear?\nThomas O. Staggs: Yeah, Q3 has costs in it associated with G-FORCE, yes. \nSpencer Wang - Credit Suisse: Great. Thank you. \nLowell Singer: All right, Spencer, thank you. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citigroup.\nJason Bazinet - Citigroup: I just have one question for Mr. Iger -- I guess you guys have obviously made a lot of traction focusing on the tween market for girls. And you\u2019ve also spoken in the past about focusing on brands. When you think about building brands or buying brands, do you focus on particular demographics where it\u2019s sort of independent, you don\u2019t really start with a certain customer segment and work backwards, you just try and find or build good brands, sort of independent of where they fit in the overall mapping of the demographics? Thanks. \nRobert A. Iger: Well, we tend to look for businesses that fit under the Disney brand umbrella and therefore being basically family friendly. We certainly know of our strength among girls and the fact that we\u2019ve been strengthening among boys and tweens and we would to some extent look to continue to strengthen both categories, or all categories -- family, boys, and girls.  I don\u2019t think we -- if it fits, it doesn\u2019t necessarily matter to us whether it is attractive to one gender or the other. The question first is does it fit. \nJason Bazinet - Citigroup: Understood. Okay, thank you very much. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, Jason. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson of Deutsche Bank.\nDoug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank: Tom, just a clarification -- those G-FORCE costs, were those P&A or production write-downs? And then my question is for Bob -- and my question is how do you intend to manage the ratings seasonality of the broadcast TV business? I think in the past you\u2019ve commented, you still feel there\u2019s a business model for quality broadcast programming. I think the level of investment at ABC follows that philosophy but we\u2019ve sort of been here early this decade before and if ABC doesn\u2019t have substantial success this fall, you could argue next season could be pretty tough for profit.  So do you manage the business for margin in that situation or you take your lumps and run the network at losses until it finds some hits? Thanks. \nThomas O. Staggs: So I\u2019ll start with your question on G-FORCE -- as I alluded to, G-FORCE looks like it\u2019s a big hit with audiences. It\u2019s going to be less of a financial success and as a result, we have costs that go above P&A in Q3. \nRobert A. Iger: I think the answer on the second part of the question is yes. We are managing the network obviously to create successful programs because we know, as you suggested, that that\u2019s what drives the revenue. We actually feel very good about the schedule that\u2019s coming up, particularly the new shows that we are adding to it and the fact that we are owners as well as renters of programs, and we like both but we certainly love owning, particularly when they are successful. And in fact, Flash Forward, which is a drama that is getting a fair amount of buzz is a show that is produced by ABC Studios. If we find ourselves in a year where success is allusive to us, we obviously will have to address our cost side pretty quickly but you also have to understand that typically what happens when you experience failure in that business is you have made your significant program commitments already and while there might be some continued infrastructure efficiencies to be gleaned, those are things that we typically look at anyway, success or failure. So you pretty much get stuck having to live with the failure from a cost perspective without much flexibility.  Does that answer your question?\nDoug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank: It does. Thank you. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, Doug. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson of Sanford Bernstein.\nMichael Nathanson - Sanford C. Bernstein: Thanks. I have a couple for Tom on the cable networks -- Tom, we\u2019re trying to figure out just the affiliate fee growth, maybe on an apples-to-apples basis without the deferrals and I was going to ask you a question -- if you look at the first two quarters of this year in terms of what you disclosed in the Q, your current run-rate for affiliate fee growth was running at about 90% of last year\u2019s run-rate. I know this quarter you had some deferrals but if you look when the year is all done, the fiscal year is all done, do you think a range consistent with the first half is an appropriate estimate for the full year growth rates in affiliate fees?\nThomas O. Staggs: Well you know, we don\u2019t give out specific growth rates on our affiliate fees. I will say that in terms of the contracts in place in the first two quarters, there were not differences driven by the timing of programming in terms of what we deferred in the first two quarters, so therefore the first two quarters, affiliate is apples-to-apples with each other between the years, so that gives you a decent indication of the change in affiliate fees at that point in time. \nMichael Nathanson - Sanford C. Bernstein: That\u2019s a good way to answer the question. \nThomas O. Staggs: As we sit here today, I\u2019ve deferred $138 million more in affiliate fees than I had sitting here at this time for the first nine months in total than where I was sitting here at this time last year. \nMichael Nathanson - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay, and the second one would be when you look at the equity income from your cable networks, joint ventures, it declined this year, this quarter by about $20 million but it had been growing quarter over quarter, so I wondered what happened to Lifetime and A&E maybe this quarter that you didn\u2019t see the first half of the fiscal year?\nThomas O. Staggs: Well, there\u2019s a decent -- equity income of investees in total has a number of things going on in it. There was some one-time items last year, as I recall, and the -- but all in all though, some of what you saw in the other businesses, a difficult ad environment, et cetera, does show up in those numbers, so we\u2019ve got that going on too but there\u2019s a little bit of noise in the system that probably is why it looks odd to you. \nMichael Nathanson - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay, thanks. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Thank you. Good afternoon. If I could ask two -- one, what are your thoughts on the strategy in the U.K.? Obviously this is a big move into that market but in many ways, you could argue Sky Sports is sort of the ESPN of the U.K., so you\u2019ve got a pretty powerful incumbent there. How do you think about building this business over time? You\u2019ve got some soccer rights over the next three years but maybe looking past that -- how big does this become? What are your thoughts moving into Continental Europe? And then second, Bob, you\u2019ve been more cautious on the idea of authentication or TV everywhere, however you want to describe it. There has been a lot of momentum on that front this quarter. Maybe you could just update us on how you are thinking about that, those initiatives in general. \nRobert A. Iger: The opportunity for ESPN in the U.K. was pretty unique and while we are looking at a number of opportunities in markets beyond just Continental Europe but across the world, I would have to say that there aren\u2019t others as obvious or attractive as the one that we just took advantage of. We ended up, as you know, buying the rights to Premiere League at a number that we had put in, submitted a while ago and got passed over or beat out by [Cetanta], and then in their struggles we ended up with a package that we bid a certain amount for and ended up getting it for that amount, which was great.  We are working very closely with Sky in the U.K. as a distribution partner because we respect their market position both in terms of their brand but also in terms of their distribution leverage and the relationship that they have with consumers.  So we think we actually have a situation where we can co-exist in that market with Sky, both as a brand and as an entity that gets distributed by the. You know, there\u2019s -- my guess is -- the bottom line is that we think there\u2019s room for both of us in the market and we think this is a really unique opportunity for ESPN and we are encouraged by it. We\u2019ve wanted to enter that market for a while but we knew that it would be a very difficult thing without having access to the Premiere League and it was available and we ended up with it, so we are pleased.  On the authentication front, I know so much has been said about this -- I\u2019ll start by saying that we don\u2019t want to do anything strategically in that business that puts at risk or in jeopardy the value that is created in our multi-channel business, which we know is pretty obvious, particularly when you look at the media network\u2019s performance, even in a difficult economy.  That said, we have certain questions about the viability of what\u2019s being contemplated and we do worry that it could create issues for the consumer that could end up doing more harm than good. We don\u2019t know whether it works, we don\u2019t know how consumer friendly it\u2019s going to be, et cetera and so on. So while we are open-minded about the notion of delivering our product more broadly to consumers, including through third-party distributors, we want to make sure that when it\u2019s distributed, it\u2019s distributed in such a way that it\u2019s very consumer friendly.  The last element that I think is really important is that our product is extremely valuable. It\u2019s valuable as a service to the multi-channel distributors, it\u2019s valuable to the consumer and if we are offering it on another platform or another location for the consumer to access it, then I believe that that\u2019s more value that we are delivering either to a distributor or to a consumer and we should get paid appropriately for that.  There\u2019s been a fair amount of talk about simply adding it on to or building -- rather building it into the current offering and for entities that are worried about giving things away for free and that have criticized us for doing similar things with our product online, we find it pretty interesting that they are willing to give this away for free as simply another part of the service that they are getting paid for.  So I would say we\u2019ve got a healthy amount of skepticism about it but we are also open-minded about it. \nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Thanks for your help. \nLowell Singer: Okay, Ben, thank you. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente of Barclays Capital.\nAnthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital: Thanks. Good afternoon. One question for Tom and one for Bob -- Tom, I was wondering if you could help us in modeling CapEx over the next few years, given your investments in the parks?  And then Bob, the question is longer term, for longer term investors in Disney, I think people are trying to figure out can your growth outpace the earnings growth of the S&P 500, so I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us your longer term view of which of your business segments are more likely to enhance excess growth over and above the S&P and which of those business segments in the next few years might detract from that growth? Thanks. \nThomas O. Staggs: Sure. So with regard to capital, I think the best way to think about it is in terms of the projects that we have in the pipeline that will impact sort of what we are spending and the biggest user of capital in the company is clearly parks and resorts and that\u2019s where the biggest ongoing projects are. We\u2019ve got two new cruise ships that get delivered starting at the end of calendar 2010. The expansion of Disney California Adventure, the expansion of Hong Kong that we talked about, just signed and has been detailed in the Q this quarter. Of course, our resort in Hawaii and those are the biggest pieces that sort of are over and above the normal pattern of our capital expenditures for the parks.  You know -- \nAnthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital: So would it be more than double-digit growth or is it growing as a percentage of revenues? Is there a way you can help us quantify the growth in CapEx?\nThomas O. Staggs: Well to be honest with you, I\u2019m not sure I would encourage you to look at it that way because first of all, it\u2019s kind of lumpy. We\u2019ve got, for instance, the cruise ships coming on. Those are not percent of revenue kind of things. They\u2019ll come through, we\u2019ll make the payment, and then they will go into service and start to earn what we think will be very attractive returns.  And really overall what drives us in this is that these are projects that we all think can deliver attractive returns for the company over time and so -- if you look at the way we are managing -- and this is not just for the parks but obviously some of the digital initiatives that we\u2019ve taken on, the media networks, especially ESPN, they tend to be the kind of projects that are somewhat more one-time oriented. There\u2019s an ongoing level of capital at the parks that you all have become relatively familiar with. And to varying degrees, we\u2019ve talked about the size of these things but it\u2019s a little bit lumpy and it\u2019s sort of hard to talk about in terms of the percentage and that sort of thing.  But look, we\u2019ve been obviously really closely managing our costs but we are also closely managing our capital. We are looking at the timing of initiatives and to the extent that we believe that we can without sacrificing value put off capital, we\u2019re doing so and we will continue to manage that. We are managing our balance sheet closely.  As you all know, we haven\u2019t been returning capital to shareholders during the downturn through share repurchase. I would note, by the way, that given the relative stability that we are seeing in the environment, and the capital markets, we are likely to be back in the market for our shares in the relatively near future, so in terms of our capital needs and our cash flow, we feel very good about our ability to maintain the strength of our balance sheet, fulfill those capital requirements, and be in the business of returning some capital to shareholders. \nRobert A. Iger: And the second part of your question, first of all, I don\u2019t know what growth trajectory the S&P 500 is going to be on, so it\u2019s a little bit tough to speculate except I can say that we\u2019ve got some of our own compensation specifically linked to how we perform versus the S&P, so we are certainly motivated to outperform the S&P as a senior management team and focus on that a fair amount.  You know, we\u2019ve articulated our growth strategy a fair amount and so I never mind -- but I never mind continuing to do it. I just fear of being repetitive. But we could just talk about some of the things that we\u2019ve done even in the last quarter during a pretty difficult economic environment and it suggests that we believe we have opportunities to grow. The ESPN front, what we talked about and what we\u2019ve done at local, which is stunning in terms of the result, an experiment in Chicago that had ended up so successful that it serves as a model to do it in other markets. We haven\u2019t taken ESPN in a local direction. We know it\u2019s a phenomenal brand.  That\u2019s one example of basically taking a brand that many people feel has maturity and whose growth trajectory is going to slow down and investing modestly to find an opportunity that can create some interesting growth. Obviously what we talked about in the U.K., another example of that, so international growth.  What we are doing at ESPN in the digital space -- we have commitments now to roll ESPN 360 out to 42 million homes and we just launched 17 million homes in Comcast markets, another example of a space that one of our brands had not been in with a very, very interesting opportunity. On the Disney front, I really believe that there\u2019s a lot of room to grow our Disney branded businesses, starting with the strength of our IP, continuing to invest in it but then looking for all kinds of opportunities. We relaunched Toon Disney into Disney XD, aimed at going at a more boy oriented audience. The ratings have been pretty substantial in terms of improvement, albeit off a low base. We had a lot of room to grow but we think there\u2019s great opportunity there. The various things that we are doing under the Disney Brand umbrella in parks and resorts that Tom just talked about, from cruise ships to Hong Kong to California Adventure to the potential of other site-based entertainment opportunities outside of the United States, we\u2019ve all talked about.  I think there are digital opportunities and I know a lot has been talked about in terms of monetization we actually believe in. Just some of the work that we are doing out of the ad lab that was written about the other day in Texas that suggests that what\u2019s ahead in terms of behavioral targeting online and the ability for us to really create value for advertisers gets really interesting.  So I see a world where there\u2019s going to be more importance on brands, more opportunity for our brands, an ability to monetize, greater consumption of media, and international growth and if we hit it right, not only in terms of being opportunistic but really keeping the pipeline really rich from an IP perspective, I think that the growth perspective of this company is pretty robust. \nLowell Singer: Thanks, Anthony. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Bank of RBC Capital Markets.\nDavid Bank - RBC Capital Markets : Thanks very much. I guess I have two questions I\u2019m going to try and slip in -- the first is can you clarify when the new ships actually go into service, when they start generating revenue and can we expect kind of an unusual ramp-up of costs surrounding that?  And the second question is UP has been a real success theatrically. How would you compare the UP opportunity versus the Toy Story opportunity with the ancillary markets, things besides the theatrical -- the licensing side, the videogame side? How do you compare what you expect from the big 2010 event versus UP?\nRobert A. Iger: I\u2019ll start with the second question, UP -- obviously a tremendous success, already roughly 285 in U.S. box office, the markets that it\u2019s opened up in internationally, albeit limited, have been very successful and we\u2019ve got big markets yet to come from now through actually this weekend is a big weekend but all the way through October when we launch in the U.K. and December when we launch in Japan. So we definitely have a hit on our hands but UP is not the kind of movie that is going to generate the kind of multi-platform franchise success of movies like Cars or Toy Story or other movies that we have in the pipeline, like the Princess movies, starting with Princess and the Frog.  Very proud of the film on both a -- from a commercial perspective and artistic perspective, but we don\u2019t put it in the franchise category just because of the nature of the film, and that\u2019s fine with us. We can\u2019t set about to make every film, whether it\u2019s Pixar or otherwise, as a franchise. We\u2019ll take a great film though and a film that could end up being the second highest grossing Pixar film of all time.  Toy Story 3, by the way, which will be out in fiscal 10, you mentioned it, that\u2019s a real franchise. You see Toy Story attractions at every one of our parks worldwide, a big consumer products platform, real opportunities I believe for Toy Story and other forms, from videogames to online, and also the possibility of sequels beyond Toy Story 3, so just a completely different category.  The first question, the first of the two cruise ships that we are building will come online around the second quarter of fiscal 2011, so the very end of calendar 2010, beginning of calendar 2011. \nThomas O. Staggs: Yeah, it will be in service in the early part of the 2011 calendar year. \nRobert A. Iger: So we won't really get revenue from it until 2011 calendar year but early in the year and you will see a ramp-up of costs in that business associated with both building but also associated with operating that will actually come before we launch what will be our third ship. \nThomas O. Staggs: Yeah, to Bob\u2019s point -- and the second ship is fiscal 2012, so the cost builds up, it doesn\u2019t take long to get the ships up and running, in service and producing revenue, obviously, but there is some ramp-up in costs. And the bulk of the capital hits in the year of delivery, so -- \nRobert A. Iger: Right, and our target that we\u2019ve had, this double-digit returns on capital in the two ships and we believe that we will be able to sustain that in the two ships that we are building.  They are gorgeous and we will reveal their design sometime in the fall. Substantially larger, as we\u2019ve talked about, and real state-of-the-art on a number of different fronts and we are very excited about them. They will be very, very unique. \nDavid Bank - RBC Capital Markets : I think you should host a party for the analysts on the ships. That would be a good idea. \nRobert A. Iger: Well, if you\u2019d like, the first crossing will be a mid-winter crossing in the North Atlantic. One thing we know is you will be able to save on sunscreen. \nLowell Singer: Thank you, David. Okay, Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Miller of Caris & Company.\nDavid Miller - Caris & Company: Good afternoon, a couple of questions -- Tom, just outstanding attendance numbers at Disneyland. I mean, the demand curve there just continues to sort of move to the right here. We know that there is a five-for-three promotion. We were hearing that the promotion was going to end sometime in mid-September. Just given these kinds of numbers, do you see it ending beforehand or do you see sort of continuing that five-for-three promotion until the end of the year? And then I have a follow-up for Bob. Thanks. \nRobert A. Iger: Actually, I\u2019m going to take that, Dave. You know, we\u2019ve announced the free dining but we haven\u2019t made any announcements to what extent we\u2019ll continue the other promotions. We are obviously dealing with a marketplace where there\u2019s not all that much visibility but it\u2019s a challenging marketplace and we do expect the challenge to continue and so we are going to be really strategic in terms of the discounting that we are doing. And we feel strongly that to date, the discounting that we\u2019ve done has actually been quite good for our business. Our business would not be as strong without it. And we have some interesting research that really validates what we are doing.  First of all, there\u2019s a real spike in perception and price to value ratio of people who go to our parks. They really believe they are getting a better value for the price and that\u2019s a good thing because we know that we are providing a great experience and we also know the value of word of mouth of the people who go, and the ability for us to bring people back who have come for the first time.  So I think that it\u2019s been a good thing for us and I also know from some of the research that we\u2019ve done is that we are attracting people today that would never have come before, and that\u2019s really interesting. So we are obviously making product available under affordable circumstances for people who, even in tough times, are willing to go because they either couldn\u2019t afford it before or they believe it might not be affordable later on.  This is great product. We know that, no matter what park you visit. It\u2019s a great experience. I\u2019m pretty confident that we\u2019ll be able to wean ourselves into distribution as the marketplace solidifies but we haven\u2019t made any specific announcements yet, just in terms of how much the discount, whether and what discounting will continue. \nDavid Miller - Caris & Company: Okay, great and then just a quick follow-up -- that\u2019s three hits in a row if G-FORCE carries over from an outstanding opening weekend, so you\u2019ve got UP, Proposal, and then G-FORCE -- again, three hits in a row. You know, what would you say to your critics out there who continue to claim that Disney is in creative stagnation?\nRobert A. Iger: Well, I don\u2019t get to talk to our critics all that much, so I just -- Disney is not in creative stagnation. The pipeline is pretty rich at the studio right now. 2010 I am really excited about, both live action and animation. I talked about the titles earlier, from Christmas Carol to Toy Story to Princess and the Frog and Prince of Persia and Johnny Depp and Tim Burton\u2019s Alice and Wonderland. The trailer was a real sensation when it was released last week, as was the presentation at ComicCon. And we are really pleased with UP and The Proposal, particularly since The Proposal was really good value for the money. And Tom already talked about the economics as it relates to G-FORCE. We like being number one for the weekend in the U.S. and we like the performance to date but it\u2019s got some challenges from an economic perspective.  So the studio we think is in good shape creatively. \nDavid Miller - Caris & Company: Thank you. \nLowell Singer: Thank you, David. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield of Pali Capital.\nRich Greenfield - Pali Capital: Thanks for taking the question. Just in terms of Red Box, Sony signed a deal last week and there seems to be quite a bit of interest among the industry in terms of some very interested in working with Red Box and some seemingly very against Red Box, without putting rules around working with Red Box. And I\u2019m curious, Bob, how you think about it and the potential impact on your important home video business.  And then two, just to clarify on cable networks, forgetting about the full year revenue deferral, just looking at the revenue deferral in the quarter, which I think went from like $79 million of deferral last year to $37 million in the quarter this year. It looked like revenues were actually still down in cable networks and I thought Tom said that revenues were actually up in cable nets if you backed out this quarter\u2019s revenue deferral and I just was hoping you could clarify that for us. Thanks. \nRobert A. Iger: You obviously are extremely interested in Red Box, Rich. We actually did a deal through third-party distributors a couple of years ago to supply product to -- I\u2019ll call it kiosk type rentailers, Red Box and others. This is still relatively small, by the way, small part of the business and sell-through, as you know, still dominates but the deal that we did well before all the noise that\u2019s in the marketplace today essentially made available to the rentailers our product at a reduced price in exchange for an agreement to limit the number of copies that are put into the marketplace on a resale basis of basically previously viewed DVDs, which we had some concern about.  I know because you asked the question that you are also interested in the impact of this type of rental business on the overall business, and so I might as well take a moment to address that as well. As you know, I mentioned in a previous call that we saw trends in the home video business that went beyond just the impact of the economy, although I think the economy is definitely having an impact. And this is one area that we were focused on. There has been growth in the industry, at least over the last three quarters in rental, both on a digital side and on the rental of physical goods. And there\u2019s been a slight decline over that period, same period of time in sell-through. This is industry.  And again, I think that some of that is economically driven but I also think that you have a marketplace where people are not looking to build library as much as they once did and as the convenience factor changes, meaning as product gets more convenient on a rental basis, I think you are likely to see that affecting rental, meaning in a positive way.  Certainly digital is convenient and if people can, while they are going to shop on a weekly basis at a big box retailer, leave and rent a DVD for relatively low price, then that\u2019s I think viewed as very convenient and with a high price-to-value relationship. And if they are not looking to build library anymore and they are more value oriented from a shopping perspective, then I think you are going to see growth in that area. And we are contending with it in two ways -- first of all, it underscores our strategy to make films that people are not only more likely to own than to rent but are better off owning versus renting because of the value they deliver.  If you want to watch a Pixar film, or you want your kids to watch it 50 times or a Disney film, then owning it is a lot more convenient and more valuable than renting it. \nRich Greenfield - Pali Capital: So do you start making fewer films like The Proposal, which might fall into the other category versus an UP movie?\nRobert A. Iger: Our strategy is obvious in that regard. We are focused on more family, Disney branded films and fewer non-Disney branded and basically because as we\u2019ve said, the returns on investment in those films, whether you look at recent returns or longer term, are better than non-Disney branded films and that\u2019s our focus and it\u2019s going to continue to be.  Additionally, because you are seeing some pressure in the marketplace, whether it\u2019s for the economy or for the secular trends that we cite, it\u2019s an industry that has to continue to look at the expense side of the equation and our studio is very, very focused on this and committed to it and I think doing a good job in this regard. It\u2019s in the production side, it\u2019s in the distribution side, and it\u2019s in the marketing side of the business basically at every level. It\u2019s not as forgiving as it used to be and what\u2019s really interesting is the old notion that there was a market for everything isn\u2019t necessarily the case anymore. It has to be good and the price value relationship has to be really high. It has to be something people really want. It\u2019s not just enough to make a movie and expect there\u2019s a real business out there for it. \nThomas O. Staggs: Rich, on the cable revenues, if you look at the press release, you see a $29 million decline in the reported revenues for cable in the quarter. Now, this quarter we had a net deferral of $37 million of affiliate revenue. Last year\u2019s Q3 had net recognition of previously deferred revenue of 79, so it was a net recognition of 79 last year, a net deferral of 37 this year for a difference of 116, which is obviously much more than the $29 million decline, and so therefore if you backed it out, you\u2019d obviously be in a situation where revenues would grow. \nRich Greenfield - Pali Capital: Got it. Thanks for clarifying. \nLowell Singer: Rich, thank you. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Morris of UBS.\nMichael Morris - UBS: Thank you very much. I want to go back to the question about attendance and promotion at the parks, maybe get a little more detail there. Can you help us understand what percentage of your attendance right now is taking the promotions and maybe back to the point you made, Bob, about incremental attendance as a function of the promotions -- can you quantify that for us in any way? Can you also -- you mentioned one of the promotions and the timing there but can you remind us when the current major promotions will roll off? And then I guess maybe more importantly, can you see any -- do you have any visibility into attendance trends beyond the promotions as they stand right now, and are you guys -- can you give us any feedback on maybe what you are seeing in bookings beyond the current promotional period? And then in terms of -- sorry, just to go over to ESPN, the deferral, can you share with us the profit impact of the deferral and just I guess affirm that all of that would come through the profit line in the fourth quarter? Thanks. \nThomas O. Staggs: I\u2019ll start with the ESPN question -- it\u2019s only deferral of revenue, no costs are deferred with that revenue, so it\u2019s -- they flow straight through.  So let me see if I can try to help you on your question with regard to the parks. The promotions, as you know when you look at them, are principally aimed at resort guests, not all of our attendance comes from our own resorts, so that\u2019s sort of the first factor.  As you would expect, the promotions, whether it\u2019s the four-for-three or the free dining for the people who are having extended stay, those are going to appeal to I guess first and foremost of our domestic attendance base, to a certain extent to the international attendees, less so for the resident attendants, which tend to be shorter stays.  If you look at attendance in the third quarter across our domestic parks, there was pretty good, relative strength in domestic attendance. International attendance was a little softer, in part due to frankly some tough comparisons last year.  If you look at our attendance base right now, we are running roughly a percentage point lower in terms of international mix of attendees versus where we were last year, in that order of magnitude.  So the question of how many people are taking the promotion is a pretty complicated one. If you look at our resort base and look at the net effective rates that we are getting across our categories of hotel rooms, the net effective rates discounts are pretty consistent across those various categories of rooms, and so that tells me that it\u2019s a pretty broad-based take-up of our promotions. It also tells me that the parks group is doing a pretty darn good job of managing the inventory of rooms as they think about how to book.  And so we feel good both about the response of those promotions and the way that the promotions are being managed to sort of maximize attendance.  In terms of the major promotions, buy four, get three free at Walt Disney World went until about the middle of our fourth quarter -- it goes until about the middle of our fourth quarter. The free dining extends until October 3rd of this calendar year. The five-plus-three at Disneyland goes until October 1st, for travel dates. We\u2019ve got some summer promotions and that sort of thing that have run their course, or will run their course.  And then we are going to, as Bob mentioned, we are going to take our cue from the economy in terms of what promotions we put in place and how long they run and what the extent of the promotions are, and so those will be forthcoming from the parks group as we go along. \nRobert A. Iger: And we\u2019ve done a fair amount of research of the consumer, both the consumer that\u2019s already come to our parks and the general consumer in the marketplace and we\u2019ll know what is of interest to them from a discount perspective and react accordingly, and take into account obviously the cost to us.  What\u2019s clear, and this is a quote from the CFO of that business whom I spoke with the other day, is that the consumer is still shopping late and shopping hard. They are shopping late, they are making decisions late, and they are shopping hard. They are still out there looking for value and that\u2019s a factor that we obviously can\u2019t ignore.  I also want to say one more thing -- I want to go back to the question about the rental DVD business. \nThomas O. Staggs: Before you do, I just want to clarify one thing -- we just did announce that we extended the free dine at Walt Disney World for travel dates that go to the middle of December, so we do have one that we\u2019ve already extended as we look at the lay of the land. \nRobert A. Iger: The one thing I just wanted to mention on the DVD front that I forgot to mention as it related to our business and our strategy, and that is that our conversion rate of DVD sales to U.S. box office is still running nicely ahead of the rest of the industry, which suggests that the strategy to focus on the kind of movies that we are making, the bulk of the movies that we are making, is the right strategy. \nLowell Singer: Okay, Operator, we have time for one more question. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wienkes of Goldman Sachs.\nMark Wienkes - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Just back to the film business quickly here, there\u2019s a lot of changes going on in the Pay TV window for feature films. I guess can you talk to how you think about Disney can best monetize your film product, not just Pay TV I guess but through the life of a film, which distribution channels you might want to own more directly, like the new stake in [inaudible] versus just third-party?\nRobert A. Iger: We are obviously deriving a fair amount of value from third-party distributors in our TV business and in our motion picture business and I don\u2019t really see that strategy changing all that much in the sense that I think that value will continue to be mined. It\u2019s possible that there will be more distributors in the marketplace to distribute our product and I see that as a good thing, and it\u2019s also possible over time that there will be more windows to sell, there will be more slicing and dicing of the spectrum, so to speak, both on the TV and the movie side. And while I think it\u2019s a little early to tell when it\u2019s going to deliver more value, certainly competition among distributors should deliver more value.  In terms of owning, we thought Hulu was a good opportunity to own a platform that had far exceeded our expectations in terms of the aggregation play and we thought it was a good opportunity for us.  On the movie side, the only thing that we are looking at right now that would be even slightly analogous to that is the creation of the subscription service online for Disney branded content starting with movies. It\u2019s in a development stage and we\u2019ve talked about it publicly as something that\u2019s coming but we haven\u2019t suggested when, nor have we been overly descriptive but we think there\u2019s an opportunity given the strength of the brand and the advantage that we have as stewards of the Disney brand to create an online destination for Disney branded product only, starting with movies. And we are excited about that. \nMark Wienkes - Goldman Sachs: Have you talked about the timing of where that window would land on -- relative to the other windows?\nRobert A. Iger: No, we haven\u2019t gotten specific about it but we -- just the fact that we believe we will continue to see value from some of the existing windows, including the pay window, suggests that we won't do something that we think, you know, necessarily destroys that value, although there were definitely opportunities from a windowing perspective and there are also what I\u2019ll call definitional opportunities, where you sell the one entity the ability to exploit or to leverage our product in one way and you can either on your own or to another third party give them the ability to distribute in a different way, either from a timing perspective or streaming online or subscription versus video-on-demand, et cetera and so on, or aggregated play as part of a pay TV service, for instance. But we don\u2019t want to get more descriptive than that. \nMark Wienkes - Goldman Sachs: Right. Thank you very much. \nLowell Singer: Okay, Mark, thanks and thanks to everyone for joining us today.

Iger: Thank you, Lowell and good afternoon. Our second quarter performance reflected the weak global economy as well as disappointing results at our movie studio. While we are now seeing some signs the economic downturn is stabilized, it is too early to make predictions about the timing and pace of the recovery.  On our last earnings call, I spoke about how the cyclical economic downturn and the secular changes facing certain of our businesses were causing us to take a hard look at what we do and how we do it. Since then, we\u2019ve taken significant steps to pare costs and to organize our businesses to be better positioned in an environment where people are consuming a growing amount of content online even as they continue to enjoy traditional media.  What hasn\u2019t changed, however, is our overall business strategy with its emphasis on creativity, technology, and international growth, as a means of driving shareholder returns. We remain committed to making great creative content and to making sure that content is delivered to consumers the world over in the best ways possible. This approach is exemplified by the recent announcement that we are joining Hulu as an equity partner and programming provider. Like ABC.com, Hulu is proving to be a great experience for the consumer and we believe that broader distribution of our content makes sense given the ongoing growth in online viewing.  Joining Hulu also allows us to expand the relevance and popularity of our brands and content. It helps combat piracy by offering a better alternative to consumers and we believe it will allow us to expand and diversify revenues over time without fundamentally undermining traditional business relationships, models, and windows.  As we look ahead, we see a blend of new and traditional media and business models utilizing both established and new distribution and marketing platforms. The movie theater isn\u2019t going away, neither is broadcast television, but the same can also be said of new media. It isn\u2019t going away and we expect it to grow in size and significance to people\u2019s lives.  For that reason, we absolutely must be where our consumers are going. We believe that by providing consumers tangible value in new ways, we will ultimately be fairly compensated for it and thus create greater value for our company.  Turning back to the quarter, our media networks posted a notable performance, led by ESPN and the Disney Channel, which continued to build their brand strength through differentiated and engaging programming. The segment held up remarkably well given the challenging economic environment. ABC is in the process of consolidating its network and studio operations and we are pleased by the strong mix of programs which form the core of its primetime schedule. We do, however, recognize the importance of adding successful new shows to ABC\u2019s lineup. After posting strong results last year, studio performance was disappointing, something they\u2019d be the first to admit. But we are enthusiastic about several upcoming films, including UP, which in a great validation of Pixar\u2019s artistry, has been chosen as the first animated film to open the Cannes Film Festival. Princess and the Frog, an innovative take on the classic Disney Fairy Tale musical, and next year\u2019s Toy Story 3, which brings back characters beloved by an entire generation.  On the live action front, we\u2019ve got an exciting slate of movies coming up, including The Proposal, G-Force, A Christmas Carol, Prince of Persia, Sorcerer\u2019s Apprentice, and Alice in Wonderland.  At our parks and resorts, we made a conscious decision to put in place promotions that would drive attendance. This strategy has had a predictable impact on margins but its also had the intended effect of bringing people to our parks, underscoring the tremendous affinity consumers have for the Disney brand. Throughout, we have maintained our focus on quality, believing that we can derive long-term value by offering our guests an exceptional experience at affordable prices in this difficult economic environment. We expect these visits will keep guests coming back for more and telling others about the great time they had.  While the environment remains a challenging one, we are optimistic about Disney\u2019s future. We remain intensely focused on creating the best in entertainment and managing our people, capital, and brands to maximize their potential. As the economy recovers, we believe we are well-positioned to prosper and to take continued advantage of the tremendous opportunities created by the growth of digital platforms and globalization. And with that, I will turn things over to Tom. \nThomas O. Staggs: Thanks, Bob and good afternoon. Before we take your questions, I would like to make a few comments on our performance last quarter and give you a sense of some of the trends we are seeing that could factor into our future results.  Studio entertainment was the largest driver of our year-over-year declines in Q2. Home video sales were off considerably, primarily because this year\u2019s new releases did not match the strength of Enchanted, Game Plan, and No Country for Old Men in last year\u2019s second quarter.  At the box office, some of our key theatrical releases, including Bedtime Stories, Race to Witch Mountain, and Confessions of a Shopaholic, performed below our expectations and well short of last year\u2019s slate, further dampening results.  Our TV distribution contribution was lower, also due to the relative strength and timing of our products in the marketplace. I expect difficult comparisons for the studio again in Q3 due to less favorable release slates in home video and television distribution.  At our domestic parks, strong consumer response to our promotional offers helped deliver attendance in the quarter that was virtually on par with last year, despite the fact that Easter is in Q3 this year. We had higher complementary attendance this year, driven in part by our Free on your Birthday promotion.  In total, Walt Disney World attendance was down about 1%, while Disneyland was up roughly 2%. However, as Bob noted, our promotions also resulted in greater room and admissions discounting, which together with softer guest spending, impacted our margins in the quarter.  Overall, per capita guest spending at our domestic parks came in 6% lower than Q2 last year.  The buy four, get three free offer in Orlando helped to lift room occupancy to 89% versus 88% in the prior year, but also contributed to a 17% decrease in per room spending. In Anaheim, we did not have a resort promotion comparable to Walt Disney World and occupancy came in at 69%, down by 14 percentage points. Per room spending at Disneyland Resort decreased by 6%.  At our international parks, softness in guest spending and somewhat lower attendance at Disneyland Resort Paris drover lower operating income despite some improvement in results at both Tokyo and Hong Kong.  We were pleased with the pace of sales for Disney Vacation Club in Q2, however results were impacted by unfavorable securitization impacts, the sale of higher cost units in this quarter, and tough comparisons against the member term extensions for our old Key West property sold in the prior year.  Our parks management did a good job in offsetting a portion of our revenue declines by reducing costs. At the same time, we are careful to maintain the quality of our guest experience, so our cost reduction opportunities are somewhat limited, especially given the relatively modest declines in volume that we are experiencing. Looking ahead, room reservations at our domestic resorts for the balance of the fiscal year are nearly on par with the prior year, with Q3 slightly ahead of last year due in part to our buy four, get three free offering at Walt Disney World, which runs through the middle of Q4.  At our consumer products segment, our ownership of Disney Stores North America drove an increase in the amount of revenue we recognized in the quarter but negatively impacted our profits and margins. The difficult retail environment has persisted, affecting our Disney Stores results worldwide, as well as our licensing business. Q2 earned licensing royalties were down by a little over 10% on a comparable basis versus the prior year.  As Bob indicated, our media network segment, led by our cable businesses, performed relatively well given the tough advertising market. At ESPN, increased affiliate revenue more than offset lower advertising revenue and higher programming costs. ESPN\u2019s ad sales were down by a high single-digit percentage in the quarter, consistent with what we saw in Q1, due in part to continued softness in several ad categories, including consumer electronics, automotive, and financial services.  The quarter also benefited from higher affiliate revenue across our other cable networks and increased advertising revenue at ABC Family.  At broadcasting, continued weakness in the local ad market and lower political ad spending compared to the prior Q2, drove a 30% revenue decline at our TV stations. This decline is larger than what we reported in our first quarter this year, but if you exclude political ad spending from both quarters, the trend in ad sales at our TV stations was slightly better than what we saw in Q1.  Ad sales at the ABC network were down modestly versus the prior year. Programming and production costs at ABC were up versus last year\u2019s Q2 when production was affected by the writers\u2019 strike. These higher costs were partially offset by higher international sales of shows, including Ugly Betty, Desperate Housewives, and Criminal Minds.  We will also see increased programming costs in Q3, again due to the changes in the timing of production spending as a result of the strike. Softness in the ad market continues this quarter, drive by the same categories as in the last couple of quarters. I would also note that we are seeing ad buyers making decisions and placing orders closer to the dates their ads run. We have seen a similar trend in the booking window at our resorts. So while we believe that the pace of decline is generally stabilized, we believe that ad buyers and consumers remain cautious.  Given the challenging operating environment, we are managing our costs closely, as evidenced by the charges we took during the quarter. These actions are having a significant impact on our costs. A number of them represent temporary measures in response to the downturn but many of them are structural and therefore more permanent changes to our cost base.  We will continue to take steps to become more efficient in coming quarters. But as Bob mentioned, the economic downturn does not change our fundamental strategy, so the decisions we are making now are focused on executing against that strategy and putting our company in position to thrive as the economy rebounds.  With that, I will turn it back to Lowell for Q&A.\nLowell Singer:  Okay, thanks, Tom. Operator, we will be happy to take the first question.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Spencer Wang of Credit Suisse. Please proceed. \nSpencer Wang - Credit Suisse: Thanks and good afternoon. One question regarding costs, maybe in two parts though -- Bob, last quarter you talked about reducing the cost structure, particularly at the studio in light of the new environment. This quarter revenues were down about 20% but costs were basically flat call it year-on-year, so can you just talk a little bit about how we should expect the cost structure to change going forward?  And then for Tom, at theme parks last cycle, your margins peak to trough went down by about 800 basis points. Should we expect that similar kind of dynamic this cycle or will something be different? Thank you. \nRobert A. Iger: The plan in the studio, Spencer, is to address costs virtually every level, starting with the number of films released where we had reduced a few years ago to down to the level that we are currently at and while we don\u2019t have specific plans, it\u2019s possible we\u2019ll continue to look at reducing the total output of the studio.  We\u2019re also looking obviously at the cost of production, although as we reduced our number of films, the percentage of tent pole movies as part of the slate has gone up, so the average cost per film has gone up slightly, but we are going to look at that carefully and of course, we are going to look at marketing, where I think we have some real opportunities in terms of reducing expenses.  And then lastly we\u2019ll continue to look at our infrastructure. We\u2019re just restructuring the company in Europe, an announcement that we made in the last few months, and we think we\u2019ve got opportunities there, and we\u2019ll look across the globe as the studio did a few years ago, at opportunities not just in the studio business but in all of our businesses to restructure with an eye toward not only creating more accountability but more efficiency. \nThomas O. Staggs: Spencer, with regard to the parks, I want to avoid giving you guidance on where margins will be, not to obfuscate but because frankly no two economic environments are the same and no two downturns are the same, likewise. I would say this -- if all things were equal, I believe the parks group is, first of all, as adept as they have ever been, and perhaps more so at managing their cost base. I also believe they have some greater amount of arrows in their quiver with that regard and a somewhat more diversified base of business.  So if all things were exactly equal, I think that we could come out better in terms of total margin decline than we did in the past. But again, I would hasten to add that we haven\u2019t seen the whole picture yet and therefore it\u2019s difficult to make a prediction on exactly where things will come out. \nSpencer Wang - Credit Suisse: Great, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. \nLowell Singer:   Okay, Spencer, thanks. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nDoug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank: Thanks very much. A question for both Bob and Tom -- it wasn\u2019t that long ago investors thought Disney was capable of producing $2.50 a share in earnings, and now that investors have moved on from trying to figure out 2009 earnings downside due to the recession to try to figure out earnings power in a recovery, I am wondering if you believe the earnings power for Disney has been hampered by any structural changes brought about by the recession or any secular challenges, whether you think your businesses are still capable of rebounding to their prior profitability and grow from there. Any color by segment would be welcomed, so -- thanks. \nRobert A. Iger: Well, we are not going to make predictions about how fast or how far we will rebound, or whether we will come close to or surpass the number that you mentioned. We have been pretty consistent about how we look at our businesses, both with a fair amount of optimism, believing that we have the brands and the asset mix, and that they are managed in an integrated fashion to deliver the kind of growth we think is demanded of us by shareholders.  While at the same time, we\u2019re wary that there are secular changes going on in a number of our businesses, created by mostly digital technology and changes in consumer behavior, that if we don\u2019t manage carefully will make it harder for us to grow the company at a pace that we would feel appropriate. And those that I\u2019ve noted most recently, including in my comments today, have to do with the studio and how people are consuming media in general, digital media in particular, and the impact that has on the traditional platforms. \nDoug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank: Great. Thank you. \nLowell Singer:  Thanks, Doug. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed. \nMichael Nathanson - Sanford C. Bernstein: Thanks. I have one for Bob and one for Tom; Bob, on Hulu, you clearly would not do this if you didn\u2019t think it was not cannibalistic to TV consumption, so I wonder -- what kind of research have you done to see if a move to web distribution is not a negative to overall consumption of your content? You mentioned piracy trends -- have you seen a downturn in trends in piracy as you move to the web?\nRobert A. Iger: Well first of all on the piracy front, we found that as we move product to the web, at least that where piracy that we are aware of, because there\u2019s still a lot of piracy that we are unaware of, that there\u2019s been some stabilization. And we feel pretty confidently that if we don\u2019t put our product out online in a well-timed and well-priced basis, it will be demanded by consumers and they will find -- many of them will find ways, and very quickly, and we think it\u2019s really important that we are there.  We\u2019ve looked at a lot of research as it relates to media consumption, traditional versus new platforms and frankly, Michael, it is not only inconclusive but some of the research that we\u2019ve seen actually conflicts with other research that we\u2019ve seen.  Our feeling is that, and some of this is instinct, by the way -- it\u2019s not all based on research, is that media consumption online is growing and will continue to grow, and that if our product was not available on that platform, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily retard media consumption growth. So we feel that we are better off for more than just the piracy reason -- we\u2019re better off being in that space than not being in that space. We realize that monetizing at a rate that is as robust as the traditional platforms doesn\u2019t exist yet but we believe, as my remarks indicated earlier, that eventually it will.  The other thing that is pretty interesting to us about Hulu and about the ABC.com experience, is that a lot of the consumption that we are seeing is incremental because it\u2019s a different demographic, so the average age of the consumer of stream video on ABC.com is younger than the average age of the ABC television network. That, by the way, was true in our iTunes experience as well. And what we have seen so far of the Hulu demographic suggests that the Hulu demographic is generally younger than primetime network demographics.  So we don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s necessarily cannibalization and again, our feeling about new media platforms, but the Internet in particular, is that it\u2019s only going go to grow in size from a consumption perspective and we just feel that it is really important for us to establish ourselves there as a brand or brands -- ESPN, Disney, ABC -- as sub-brands, the name of our shows, to engage consumers more with our products and our brands, to help fight piracy, and ultimately I think the monetization is going to come in a variety of ways. We\u2019ll see advertiser supported product. We are developing subscription product. We are already in the electronic sell-through product. And so I think that that blend over time is likely to become pretty interesting for us as a company and for many other companies that are creating high quality content that is capable of occupying space online. \nThomas O. Staggs: Michael, I would just add that one interesting fact is that we find in our research that online, people that consume media online, as Bob alluded to, actually consume more media overall than folks that don\u2019t and in fact, especially the folks that are early adopters, and the early adopters not only are consuming more media, they are consuming more traditional media and more of the online media, obviously.  And so I think that to Bob\u2019s point, there are real market expanding opportunities here. So it\u2019s important that we are there if our product is going to thrive, and it\u2019s important that we take part in this potential expansion of the marketplace. And we are confident in the long run that there is real ability to create value this way. \nMichael Nathanson - Sanford C. Bernstein: Tom, can I just ask you a financial question? I appreciate the answers. ABC network revenues this quarter was down modestly. Last quarter was down single digits, I think high-single-digits. So can you give us some insight into the quarter over quarter trend? What happened in the Christmas quarter versus the first quarter? How did the business get better?\nThomas O. Staggs: Well, Michael, there\u2019s a number of currents going on here. So in the first quarter, we did reasonably well, as you noted. The revenues were relatively strong, even though we had ratings down somewhat. The price in the market held up well. In the second quarter, again we are only down modestly in terms of our revenues. We had pricing in the scatter market that was modestly ahead of the up-front, but again in the second quarter, I think it\u2019s important to remember that we had a strike impacted quarter, and so that impacted the ratings year over year and the ratings comparisons and therefore the revenue comparisons. And so there\u2019s a number of things going on there.  So as we try to elevate from that and see what\u2019s going on to both my comments and Bob\u2019s, we see some stabilization in the marketplace. The ad market is there. It\u2019s perhaps not as robust -- certainly not as robust as it was a year ago at this time but at the same time, for the right shows, for the right lineup, for the right demographics, there\u2019s an ad market there to be had. \nMichael Nathanson - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay, thanks. \nLowell Singer:  Thanks, Michael. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Imran Khan of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed. \nImran Khan - J.P. Morgan: Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions -- first, in terms of the park, you know, I think the stunt that you did, promotionally did that will go through this mid fourth quarter, so I was trying to get a better sense like how is the average room night trending intra quarter and how should we think about the margins of Q3 and Q4? And second question is I believe that you benefited by the political spending on ABC on broadcasting during the second half of 2008. could you give us some sense how much was the political benefit? Because I think you talked about that without the political benefit, the business improved in the last quarter. Thank you.\nThomas O. Staggs: Let\u2019s see -- so on the television station, I mentioned that the revenue was down about 30%. In the first quarter, revenues had been down around, as I recall, 28%, and it was only -- it was slightly better in the second quarter if we neutralized for political. So it improved the second quarter by a few percentage points and had a more modest effect on the first quarter.  With regard to intra-quarter trends in room rates -- well, it\u2019s a little difficult to read, only because remember we\u2019ve got at the beginning of the third quarter, we had the Easter holiday, we had less discounting in the Easter holiday but then the promotions that we\u2019ve had in place will continue. We\u2019ve got some new promotions going on at Disneyland in the third quarter this year versus what we had in the second quarter.  So I don\u2019t expect dramatic changes in the trends in average room rate but the discounting that we had been partaking in continues. I mentioned that on the last conference call that Easter tends to shift -- last year was roughly $40 million in profit year over year. It\u2019s probably in that ballpark again this year. So I think that\u2019s the biggest difference quarter over quarter that we might see in terms of what\u2019s going on.  But in terms of the discounting that we are doing at the hotels, with the exception of some new promotions at Disneyland, which is obviously the smallest part of the room population for domestic parks, we haven\u2019t dramatically changed the trends and won\u2019t until mid-way through the fourth quarter when the promotion there at Walt Disney World ends. \nImran Khan - J.P. Morgan: Thank you. \nLowell Singer:  Thanks, Imran. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente of Barclays Capital. Please proceed. \nAnthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital: I was surprised at how well advertising at ESPN held up, just given what\u2019s happened in the auto category. And I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on advertising at ESPN and what auto represents perhaps as a percentage of the total advertising, or maybe what some of the other categories did in terms of the out-performance.  And maybe that\u2019s for Tom, and then second question for Bob -- if you could just elaborate longer term on your international growth opportunities and talk a little bit about trends that you are seeing abroad, and then talk a little bit about your park strategy abroad. That would be great. Thank you. \nThomas O. Staggs: Anthony, as we\u2019ve discussed in the past, we\u2019re obviously pleased with the audience that ESPN delivers and I think that they\u2019ve managed to turn a relatively good performance on the ad front, although given all that\u2019s going on and give the fact that some of their most important categories have been the most impacted, the ones that I mentioned on the calls, auto to your point being chief among them.  We don\u2019t break out the specific percentage of advertisers across that business. Auto is one of the biggest categories but isn\u2019t as predominant as say it is at television stations. But we have seen Ed Airheart and his team out there and they have managed to fill in with some categories that helped to make up some of the deficit -- men\u2019s grooming, insurance, those have come along well and have shown steady sign of improvement.  And so I think that they\u2019ve got a good product, they are out there doing a good job in the market place, and as I mentioned, we think that we will continue to see softness in auto, in financial services, consumer electronics, but again we\u2019ll make sure we are doing everything we can to fill in the rest of the marketplace and I think that that -- the demographic they deliver, that\u2019s going to be appealing to advertisers.  We won\u2019t make it all up but they will continue to do what they have been doing, we hope. \nRobert A. Iger: A little more on that point -- this quarter, ESPN is finding the ad market for its NBA product to be quite strong and baseball has been strengthening nicely. The movie studios have been quite helpful and the quick service restaurant segment is also doing well.  And as to your other question on the international side, you asked overall and then specifically the parks, we have been working to expand our presence in Asia, as you know, one by expanding Hong Kong Disneyland, and there was a recent report that meetings with the Hong Kong government have been productive and we are optimistic that at some point soon, we\u2019ll be able to reach an agreement that will enable us to expand that park, which has actually been doing quite well from an attendance perspective, particularly from both Southern China and other markets in China -- and so the goal, which was to use it as a means of attracting people from Mainland China, seems to be working nicely and we are going to continue to work to turn Hong Kong Disneyland into a major destination in that part of Asia, one that not only is good for its bottom line but also helps us to build the company\u2019s portfolio in that region.  We also have been in discussions, as you know, with the Shanghai government and a few months back reached a framework agreement for a park in Shanghai. That is an ongoing process that right now is awaiting approval from the Central Government and we can\u2019t really make any predictions, except that we believe the opportunity to build a Disneyland in Hong Kong is a great one for this company -- in Shanghai, rather -- and one that we would -- we are obviously working very hard to try to fulfill.  Each market across the world represents different opportunities for the company. We\u2019ve been looking hard at emerging markets but we are also continuing to look at opportunities in the developed world, where not only are we looking to reduce expenses but we are actually looking to grow top line. And it really is across the board. We continued to develop local Disney branded films -- that\u2019s still relatively small but we hope to grow that over the long-term. Our media networks are growing nicely. We now have 93 Disney channels around the world and we are working hard to look at opportunities for ESPN as well.  We\u2019ve seen some interesting opportunities on the digital front by extending our reach for Disney.com, particularly in the markets where we don\u2019t have media network presence, and there are many of them. And we are also now rolling out our virtual world business, led by Club Penguin, which is now available in multiple markets outside the United States and we are pleased with what we see.  So there\u2019s a lot of activity. The size of our international business is still not where we believe it can be but we are building foundations in a lot of parts of the world to enable it ultimately to grow at a pace and to a level that we think is possible. \nAnthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital: Thanks very much. \nLowell Singer:  Thank you, Anthony. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif-Cohen of Merrill Lynch.\nJessica Reif-Cohen - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Bob, I was wondering if we could go back to one of your earlier comments when [inaudible] -- [when you said] that you are seeing some indication the business is stabilizing, were you referring to the advertising only or are there other things you can cite across your businesses? And then secondly, it would be great if you could comment on how strong you feel like the upcoming content cycle is at the Disney Channel. You\u2019ve had such a great run, particularly in summer with High School Musical and Cheetah Girls -- how do you feel like you are positioned now for the next, for the upcoming year?\nRobert A. Iger: Well, on the Disney Channel front, we feel good about their content pipeline, both for that channel and then for the new channel, Disney XD, which is aimed at boys. The Demi Lovato show, for instance, Sunny With a Chance, is off to a great start and we just launched the Jonas Brothers series this past weekend. That also got off to a solid start. We are pleased with their upcoming movie slate and we are in development or actually in early stage production for High School Musical 4.  The team that is in place at the Disney Channel that manages its content globally is an extremely talented team and the pipeline we think is pretty rich.  To your first question, Jessica, about what has stabilized, we were referring to businesses in general, not specifically to the advertising business, although we believe that is one that we could say we see stabilization or stability. I\u2019d say on the park side, we haven\u2019t seen a trend downward for a few months. The trends that we\u2019ve seen this year were obviously reflected in our earnings, seem to be continuing and not worsening but we are not suggesting that we are seeing signs of improvement yet in that business.  Licensing would be maybe one business where we\u2019ve seen some modest stability but I think the retail segment in general could be facing some more difficult times and we are not predicting necessarily a further downturn in licensing. That\u2019s one, particularly on the international front, where I think it would be premature to say that we see stability right now.  But I would say advertising, travel and tourism for us -- video sales, although that\u2019s title specific, or slate specific, and what other business did I just -- I guess those would be the three primary ones. Generally stable. \nJessica Reif-Cohen - Merrill Lynch: Okay, thanks. Would it be safe to say there will be no more park promotions then after this one is over?\nThomas O. Staggs: We\u2019ll have to read the marketplace as we get there and take a look and make those decisions as we go. \nJessica Reif-Cohen - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you. \nLowell Singer:  Thanks, Jessica. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi of Standard & Poor\u2019s.\nTuna Amobi - Standard & Poor\u2019s: Great, thank you very much. I\u2019ve got a couple of questions as well -- so on the parks, for example, I wanted to kind of confirm what you said on the last call that given the Easter falling outside of Q2, based on the trends that you saw for the Easter, are you still confident that Q2, Q3 combined is going to be up modestly compared to last year? That\u2019s number one.  And separately on the film studio, so I think that it kind of seems ironic that the box office is having a record year and yet the -- your studio, which has been clearly one of the top performers up until of late, is not participating in that. So I wanted to get a sense of when you think -- what you need to do in the studio side to kind of balance out your top line growth. I know you did the Spielberg deal and you\u2019ve taken out a lot of costs. What do you think needs to be done to kind of balance out the top line growth strategy in the film studio on the box office side?\nRobert A. Iger: Well, I\u2019ll take the second part of the question -- you know, it\u2019s about choice of films and the execution of the films that have been chosen for production. And we\u2019ve had a rough year in terms of the performance of the slate, so in that case, it\u2019s not the marketplace -- it\u2019s our slate. And I mentioned a number of films coming up that we feel really good about, UP in particular this summer; Princess and the Frog later on in the calendar year; Toy Story 3 next year; a number of live action titles, some that will appear in 2010, A Christmas Carol being one of them, Alice in Wonderland another one, Prince of Persia another.  But then we\u2019ve got Tron and Pirates 4 and a number of other live action films that we feel, at least on this stage, quite good about. But looking back at the year, I said it in my remarks, it\u2019s been disappointing for the studio and they would be the first to admit that. \nThomas O. Staggs: Tuna, back when we did our last earnings announcement, we talked about a Q2/Q3 combined to sort of get a sense of where things were going, and we mentioned it had been about on par with the prior year. You\u2019ve seen now the attendance for the parks domestically came in very close to the prior year -- as I mentioned, down about 1% at Walt Disney World, up about 2% at Disneyland. As we look at -- I mentioned Q3 bookings now, which are an indicator. They are obviously not definitive but the bookings for Q3 are currently modestly above the prior year and it\u2019s too early to say exactly where that will come out but it looks like the trends we talked about at that point in time are generally holding -- and again, that\u2019s part of the reason we\u2019ve talked about stabilization in our point of view as to what we are seeing in the marketplace. \nTuna Amobi - Standard & Poor\u2019s: Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Just kind of -- if I can clarify one of Bob\u2019s earlier comments, actually a separate clarification here on the media consumption research that you referenced -- I think trying to reconcile that to the comment that you made I think in Washington, D.C. last month about your -- it seemed like you were kind of opposed to this whole idea of online paying subscribers and yet you seemed to be trying to get your content to as many viewers as possible. Are you just opposed to the subscriber paid model and prefer the advertising kind of Hulu type deals, or can you kind of reconcile that comment?\nRobert A. Iger: Well, I think you misunderstood me. I believe that our online revenue will come from a variety of forms, as I mentioned just a few minutes ago. I\u2019m not against subscription at all; in fact, we are developing a subscription service ourselves for Disney branded content.  I think maybe what you might be referring to is my comments about authentication which is pretty complicated subject. We wouldn\u2019t be necessarily opposed to authentication, particularly if it enabled people who are already paying subscribers to multi-channel services to watch the programs and those channels online, possibly even for an additional fee. That actually might generate new revenue for the business, not just content providers but for distributors.  Where I start to have problems is that if authentication is being developed as a means of blocking people who are not multi-channel subscribers from watching anything online, that tends -- that we believe is not only anti-consumer but anti-technology and we have some issues with that.  So you might have interpreted those comments which were made in Washington at the NCTA convention to mean something else. \nTuna Amobi - Standard & Poor\u2019s: All right. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you for the clarification. \nLowell Singer:  Okay, Tuna, thank you. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I actually wanted to dive a little deeper on the Hulu front, Bob, and ask you about your various TV assets. If you look at ABC, the Disney Channel, maybe ABC Family as three somewhat distinct business models, how do you think about putting that content on Hulu and also how do you think about using the iTunes or the pay to own, pay to rent model? It would seem like the more you put on Hulu, the less you are going to get on an electronic sell-through or electronic rental basis. Do you think you will window the content? Do you look at these three assets very differently when you look at these emerging platforms? Any color there? I realize it\u2019s early days but I would love to hear your thoughts and then I have one quick follow-up. \nRobert A. Iger: Okay, well, first of all, it\u2019s sort of a different response to your question -- we look at the brands differently, to begin with, so ABC, ESPN, and Disney were all taking a slightly different approach -- and ABC Family -- to how we are moving content to new media platforms. Disney and ESPN, we\u2019re working really hard to develop their dot.com sites as primary portals to access almost all things that fit under those brand umbrellas. And so they will get preferential treatment. ESPN is not part of the Hulu deal but the goal there is to offer not only video but information in all other forms of sort of sports consumption on ESPN.com, primarily, to build that brand out as a destination.  Disney.com, the same thing, although the Hulu deal does provide for some Disney Channel programming on Hulu, it\u2019s windowed differently than the ABC programming, and it will be put online in a window that is -- the first window will be Disney.com.  On the ABC and the ABC Family front, we concluded, particularly with ABC, that while the ABC.com experience has been a really good one and has delivered a fair amount of consumption, we thought in order to really take advantage of that medium and that platform, we had to have ABC content in more places -- I\u2019m talking about advertiser supported streams -- than just ABC.com. And over time, we became very impressed with what Hulu had accomplished in terms of its consumption, in terms of its user interface, in terms of the overall quality of the experience, and its ability long-term to monetize. And as I said a few minutes ago, we also thought we could potentially expand the audience because we believe that while there might be some overlap, it\u2019s not completely overlapped.  On the EST or electronic sell-through front versus the stream, we believe that there are people who will want to buy a program through say the iTunes platform, download it onto a hard drive commercial free, and take it with them wherever they want to go. And there will be people who are online who don\u2019t really need to put it on a hard drive, who just want to watch the show, don\u2019t want to pay for it and don\u2019t mind watching some limited commercial interruptions. So there are kind of different consumer experiences and we are looking to create a real blend in terms of how we monetize and how we reach consumers and what kind of product we make available. We basically believe that there\u2019s still a lot of value, by the way, to cable and satellite providers at the same time, that what we are offering them is the great programming, part of really strong networks and brands -- ABC, ABC Family, Disney Channel, et cetera -- and they get that in the primary window. They get that first and we are not encroaching on that window in this deal. So we\u2019ve been actually spending a couple of years completely redefining our network business, not just ABC but in general. So networks for us are primary windows that deliver a fair amount of revenue that help support the development and the production and the marketing, because that\u2019s important too, of all this great content. We monetize it obviously in a couple of ways -- subscription and advertising, which is great for us and for the reseller of this content, the multi-channel providers. And the advantage they have is that their customers see it first before it\u2019s available anywhere else. Except they wouldn\u2019t be very happy if we did nothing online, I believe, and the pirates got a hold of it and they were paying nothing to anyone. But that\u2019s a whole other story.  So again, we\u2019re looking at this in different ways. When I talk about redefining our networks, our networks are really one distribution opportunity or one distribution platform. The businesses that we are in are largely IP creation or the creation of high quality content -- ESPN, ABC, ABC Family, Disney Channel -- and the networks are just a primary platform for distribution. \nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: That\u2019s very helpful. If I could just quickly follow-up separately on the broadcast segment -- I think revenue for the segment was down about 15% in the December quarter and it was down I think 2% this quarter. You talked about ABC network and the stations I think overall were fairly similar, probably together when you look at December versus March. So what drove the big sequential improvement? Was this a big syndication quarter and maybe if you could help quantify that for us, that would be helpful.\nThomas O. Staggs: The quarter over quarter comparisons for the first quarter in broadcasting were more difficult if you line up the ad sales, and that was really the primary driver. It wasn\u2019t just ad market but that was the biggest driver there. \nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: The year-over-year comps were tougher in the December quarter?\nThomas O. Staggs: Yes. \nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Okay, thanks. \nLowell Singer:  Thank you, Ben. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet of Citigroup.\nJason Bazinet - Citigroup: One quick question -- I think in your opening remarks, you said it was too soon to talk about the timing or magnitude or recovery, and I just had one question regarding restructuring costs -- I think in the quarter it was about $102 million. Assuming that we just sort of bounce along the bottom like this, should we expect more restructuring costs or do you think most of the cost-cutting that you\u2019ve done is sort of baked into the system at this juncture?\nThomas O. Staggs: Well, I would say that there is a possibility, not definitively, but there is a possibility that you will see more. Certainly both Bob and I alluded to the fact that we are trying to make -- take steps right now to make sure that we are right-sizing the organization to thrive as the recovery comes. What we are not going to do is cut a bunch of headcount that we just have to add back as soon as there is a recovery.  Having said that, we think there are more opportunities to become efficient. We are going to look for those opportunities and the extent that we find them and that they lead to restructuring charges, you would see those later in the year. \nJason Bazinet - Citigroup: Okay. Thank you very much. \nLowell Singer:  Thanks, Jason. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Bank of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.   \nDavid Bank - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you. A couple of questions -- the first one is I\u2019m curious, the thinking in going to the Hulu deal, you guys were -- you know, really took your time coming up with a strategy and a lot of times observed the marketplace and YouTube probably has an audience, depending on whether or not you are looking at streams or users, something like 15 times the size of Hulu. So you could sort of argue that your ability to monetize the content, and you will certainly drive more audience to Hulu, we know, but you could potentially have monetized the content more at YouTube and I\u2019m guessing you probably could\u2019ve gotten a pretty nice guarantee from Google. So I\u2019m curious about how the thought process went there.  The second question is sometimes historically you\u2019ve had a little bit of a lumpiness in terms of deferred revenue at ESPN and kind of recognizing that revenue -- is there anything that we should be looking out for in the quarter that just passed or in the next quarter? Thanks very much. \nRobert A. Iger: We had a really healthy debate at the company about whether to make our content available to another aggregator. I should begin actually by saying in a way, this is new because we had already made a number of deals with third parties -- iTunes being one, that\u2019s an aggregator, but others as well. And when it came to Hulu versus YouTube, and I don\u2019t want to get into all the specifics, there were I guess there were things about both that were attractive to us. Obviously both have a fair amount of traffic, you\u2019re right to point out that in YouTube\u2019s case, substantially more than Hulu, although the traffic is all built on the consumption, distribution and consumption of short-form video, whereas Hulu\u2019s was largely long form, although they have clips from shows like Saturday Night Live that also did quite well. And it wasn\u2019t an easy call to make in terms of what direction to go but because we thought that both platforms were impressive.  On the other hand, what we had in Hulu was the opportunity to become an equity partner, which is something we think will derive value for the company over time, and to be part of a play that\u2019s primarily a long form play that doesn\u2019t have to sell itself as something new anymore. It\u2019s already out there and already has sold itself, whereas YouTube had to be converted to a long-term play.  Again, both interesting opportunities for us and I think both opportunities that can grow and the possibility of our long for content ending up on the YouTube platform still exists, by the way. So it was a good discussion. As I said earlier, we were impressed with the progress that Hulu made from a consumer perspective, both consumption and user interface, and ultimately decided that we would go where we could own a piece of it and really participate at what could be real growth of an aggregator. \nDavid Bank - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks. \nThomas O. Staggs: David, I think you asked about ESPN deferrals -- if you look, if we put on exactly the same number of hours of programming in the first three quarters of this year versus the first three quarters of last year, we would defer slightly more in revenue just through the natural growth in our affiliate stream. However, there are, as we get to the end of the third quarter, just the way the tests work versus the hours of live program that we put on, we are sort of close to some of the thresholds there. And so if, for example, the key threshold that we went by in the third quarter last year, we were 10, 15, 20 hours less in programming this year, you have the potential to take as much as $150 million of revenue from Q3 and push it to Q4. To the extent that becomes the case, we\u2019ll be transparent for you about it so you can figure out what it is, but assuming that the hours of programming stack up the same way that they did last year, and I suspect that they still could, or likely would, the only difference in the deferral would be through the natural growth really of the -- \nDavid Bank - RBC Capital Markets: And in Q2 there was no odd comp or anything like that?\nThomas O. Staggs: No, the deferrals -- there was no great difference in the thresholds and therefore the revenue recognition. \nDavid Bank - RBC Capital Markets: Terrific. Thank you, guys.\nLowell Singer:  Thanks, David. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Morris of UBS. Please proceed. \nMichael Morris - UBS:  Thank you. To go back to an earlier question on broadcasting, the revenue was down 2% in the quarter. You mentioned the stations were down 30 and the network was down slightly. That would imply a pretty meaningful increase of production and distribution. You cited the international market distribution of a few shows. Can you expand on that a bit in terms of I guess -- anymore detail on which markets and give us some feel for the sustainability of that increase as we look forward? And then second, at the parks, it looks like about $150 million in costs came out this quarter. How much of that is -- was fixed versus variable, given some of the per cap declines? Where are you in the cycle in terms of some of the cost-cutting measures that you have announced or put in place and how should we be thinking of that going forward, regardless of what happens on the top line? Thanks. \nThomas O. Staggs: Okay, so on the television side, yes, one of the key drivers on the revenue turned out to be international sales of shows. I mentioned some of the shows in the prepared remarks. Europe was a strong market for us. In terms of quarter-to-quarter sustainability, it really comes down to the availability of shows, et cetera, and that\u2019s not really key in terms of where the trends are going. We\u2019ve been able to keep the pipeline relatively full, so we\u2019ve got strong shows to continue to sell over the next several years. Bob mentioned filling in new shows to put in that pipeline is obviously important for us to sort of continue to sustain that over time. But the key is having the shows there and to the extent that we have had and we did this quarter, the markets, especially in Europe, have been there for us to sell into and you know, our shows have ended up being particularly appealing in that regard.  With the cost base, I\u2019m not going to try to give an exact percentage on what\u2019s fixed and what\u2019s variable, et cetera. We\u2019ll make as much of the cost savings as we can be permanent, but some of it clearly has to do with adapting to the marketplace that we are in. We had very modest changes in park hours but again, they were very modest and that wasn\u2019t a big impact overall, but that obviously would change depending on where we were in the cycle, et cetera.  A number of the actions that the parks have been taking they took in the second quarter, which means of course the savings from those haven\u2019t fully factored in as yet, and they will continue to feather into the year as we go and as we take further steps in that regard, so we hope to see the impact from the cost savings increase as we move to subsequent quarters. But again, the degree and the duration of that impact will depend largely on sort of how much more we do and what type of steps we take. \nLowell Singer:  Thanks, Mike. Michelle, we have time for one more question. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer.\nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer: Thanks -- one strategic question and one accounting question -- so obviously you\u2019ve talked a lot about Hulu on the call and I think we\u2019ve all thought a lot about it but thinking about film, are you considering a similar type of strategic decision with respect to film, particularly as you anticipate the Starz deal ending in 2012? And just any ideas on ultimately how to get better control over the distribution of film into new platforms? And then on the accounting side, when you think about weaker DVD sales, how does that impact your ultimate accounting as you model revenues and other distribution channels, such as pay TV and free TV? Thanks. \nRobert A. Iger: The pay TV deals, or the pay deals for us for our movies have been a very good source of revenue and deals that we will continue to pursue. At the same time, we realize that there are opportunities to monetize beyond those and we will continue to look at those as well. I mentioned that the possibility exists that we will have one day an online Disney branded subscription service that would be windowed in a way to make it compatible with any deals that we did in the pay window, and also enable us to build our brand and create an affinity with our customers. So we think that Disney\u2019s brand is unique when it comes to films and we would like to take advantage of that unique quality and create an online destination for Disney branded movies, but we also fully intend to pursue the pay window because it obviously has real value from a monetary perspective. \nThomas O. Staggs: On your accounting question, to the extent that for a given film we concluded that the DVD sales would be lower proportionally versus the other windows for that film, that would move amortization for that particular film relatively out of the DVD window in favor of the other windows, because we of course match revenues.  I would say that generically speaking, the changes in those estimates have not been dramatic to date but we have to do each one on a title specific basis. So when we have a title, we do our best to estimate what it will generate in revenues across the various windows and then match our amortization to go along with that. To the extent that we see changes in the relative revenue generation potential of the various windows, we\u2019ll adjust accordingly. \nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer: Thank you. \nLowell Singer:  Okay, thank you, Jason.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations of Walt Disney.\nLowell Singer: Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to the Walt Disney Company\u2019s first quarter 2009 earnings call. Our press release was issued a few minutes ago. It\u2019s now available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today\u2019s call is also being webcast and the webcast can be accessed via our website. After the call a replay and the transcript of today\u2019s remarks will also be available on our website. Joining me in Burbank today for the call are Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tom Staggs, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob and Tom are going to lead off with some comments. We will of course turn it over to you for your questions.  So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob and we will get started.\nRobert A. Iger: Disney had a challenging first quarter with all of our lines of business to various degrees by what is likely to be the weakest economy in our lifetime. Consumers and companies both are scaling back expenditure, emphasizing savings over spending, and it is unclear when this will change. At the same time, certain of our businesses are experiencing signs of secular change as competition for people\u2019s time is increasing and the abundance of choices allowing consumers to be more selective. This clearly has had an impact on broadcast television and may have a long-term potential impact on the DVD business. In essence, we don\u2019t believe the changes we are seeing in consumer behavior can all be attributed to a weak economy and we feel it is important for us to address them as more than just cyclical issues. The combination of these changes with the severe economic downturn has caused us to examine much of what we do, guided by privatism and an appreciation of the advantages afforded to us by the strength of our creativity, our brands, our assets, and the integrated way we manage our businesses. Fundamentally, we remain in a great competitive position but circumstances require us to be even smarter in day-to-day management. We believe we have a real opportunity to strengthen our brands and to make our businesses even more efficient. With respect to the downturn we are taking numerous steps to mitigate its impact. These efforts are company-wide but each business segment is adjusting according to its own conditions and needs.  We continue to look for ways to adjust our cost base to changes in demand, provided that these actions do not compromise the quality of our products or the guest experience we offer. Cost savings are only part of what we are aiming to accomplish. We are also addressing the challenges created by the secular changes I mentioned earlier. On the broadcast side, we are more focused than ever on creating great entertainment that we own and can distribute across multiple platforms in multiple territories. The consolidation of ABC Entertainment and ABC Studios creates a more sustainable cost structure, increases accountability, and underscores our commitment to this content-creation strategy. On the local broadcasting front, audience fragmentation and a weakened advertising environment is making the business much tougher. Our local television businesses have been extremely disciplined on the cost front and while it might be tempting to reduce expenses even more, we will not do so at the expense of our local news brands, which we have concluded are the single most valuable assets of these stations and where we believe additional reductions would have a long-term negative impact. Our position as a market leader in local news provides us an opportunity to increase the value of these assets, even as competitors cut back. In our film business we started taking measures three years ago to focus primarily on Disney-branded movies, allowing us to trim our output and expenses, to leverage the Disney name, and to create opportunities for other Disney businesses, thus aiming to improve returns. Today our focus is only intensifying as we address the changes affecting the DVD market. To that end we plan to reduce production, marketing, and distribution expenses at our home video business and to implement strategies that enhance the price-to-value relationship of our products. We believe the unique nature of our brand and the quality of our movies helps us to stand out in this environment but we must also innovate in order to generate attractive returns. Consumer affinity for the Disney parks remains extraordinary in this tough economy. The strength of the best experience we offer combined with new marketing and pricing strategies has enabled us to do reasonably well in terms of attendance and advance bookings. Although we can cut some costs to compensate for somewhat lower revenue levels, we are determined to protect quality.  Our goal is to offer the consumer a great experience at prices that are affordable in today\u2019s climate. We believe this is the right thing to do in order to deliver long-term value. This quarter, for the first time, we are separately reporting the results of our Interactive Media Group, composed of our console, mobile, and online gaming operations as well as Disney.com and the technology backbone that serves all of Disney. Products developed by this newly formed group play a critical role in building our brands and in deepening our relationship with the consumer. Investment in this unit is substantial but so is the opportunity to both grow its own businesses and to buttress the dismay, ABC, and ESPN brands. Disney.com remains an important destination for entertainment and information, as well as a growing online commerce business and will be the anchor of our company-wide CRM efforts. Finally, as we address these challenges, I don\u2019t want you to lose sight of the strength and commitment we have brought to launching new and growing existing creative franchises that resonate with consumers around the world, create value across the company, and are the core of our competitive advantage. Last quarter Disney Fairies got an enormous boost with an original direct-to-home DVD that has so far sold over 6.0 million copies worldwide. This year we will have a new Disney channel series and a new feature film from the Jonas Brothers, a new Hannah Montana feature film, a new 3-D version of Toy Story and the introduction of our latest Disney princess in the Princess and the Frog. Production or development is underway on sequels to Toy Story, Cars, Pirates, and High School Musical as well.  As we work through this downturn our aim is to bolster our creative capabilities, to protect our assets and cash flow and to look for additional opportunities to expand our businesses. It is an incredibly challenging time but we are clear in our objectives and disciplined in our execution. Our strengths remain the creativity of our people, our embracive innovation, and our great belief that nothing substitute for quality when it comes to setting yourself consistently apart in the eyes of consumers. By staying focused we believe we are positioning Disney for sustained long-term success. And with that, I will turn it over to Tom.\nThomas O. Staggs: I am going to take a few minutes to discuss the key drivers of our Q1 performance and I will then touch on the trends we are seeing thus far in Q2.  Let me start with Parks and Resorts. Last year we had record-high first quarter attendance at our domestic parks. In this year\u2019s Q1 our domestic parks attendance came in 5% below those levels, with roughly equal percentage declines at Walt Disney World and Disney Land. Desk spending at our domestic parks came in flat compared to the prior Q1, as slightly higher average ticket prices helped to offset lower merchandise spending. Occupancy levels in both Orlando and Anaheim were 85%, down mid-single percentage points versus last year and average spending at our hotels was up modestly.  At our international parks attendance increased, both at Disney Land Resort Paris and Hong Kong Disney Land. Operating income, however, was lower as the prior Q1 results benefited from higher real estate sales at Disney Land Resort Paris. As Bob mentioned, while our parks team manages costs based on demand, they are committed to maintaining the premium guest experience that sets us apart. That commitment helps drive the long-term value of this business. In the shorter term, it can impact margins as it did Q1. Margins in the quarter were also affected by mark-to-market adjustments for fuel hedges of approximately $40.0 million. In fact, this fuel hedge impact alone accounted for 40% of our margin decline for parks in the quarter. At Media Networks, cable operating income was down 12%. At ESPN, increased affiliate revenue more than offset lower advertising revenue but operating income was impacted by higher rights cost, administrative expenses, and receivables reserves. ESPN\u2019s current ad sales declined by high-single digit percentage points in the quarter, consistent with what we saw in Q4. The decrease was due in part to softness in several categories, including consumer electronics and automotive. Results in our domestic Disney channel were also down as a result of the great success of High School Musical 2 on DVD last year. At broadcasting, lower profits reflected ratings declines at ABC and a soft ad market, although lower programming costs at the networks helped to partially offset these factors. Q1\u2019s results were also reflected by bad debt expense associated with the Tribune bankruptcy filing. Scattered CPNs came in above up-front pricing levels by roughly 10% but were significantly lower than Q1\u2019s scatter pricing in the prior year. Our TV stations are exceptionally well positioned in their markets and have gained ad revenue share but weakness in the local ad market drove a revenue decline at the stations of approximately 15% despite higher political ad spending in the quarter. As I mentioned last December, student entertainment faced very difficult Q1 home video comparisons as the prior-year quarter because of the DVD release of Pirates of the Caribbean 3 and High School Musical 2. In addition, we in the industry as a whole realized lower conversion rates on new releases and softer demand for catalogue titles, which contributed to a decrease in DVD unit sales. These lower sales were easily the biggest factor in reduced results at the studio in the quarter. In Consumer Products Q1 earned license royalties were roughly flat versus prior year despite the difficult retail environment. The presence of Disney Stores North America revenue this year as opposed to royalty payments on the stores last year drove the segments revenue increase in the quarter but also hurt margins. We are now reporting the financials for Disney Bright Interactive business under a separate segment called Interactive Media. As Bob detailed, this new segment contains a collection of digital businesses that we believe offer attractive long-term opportunities. We expect to continue to invest further in these businesses and particularly in Disney-branded video games, websites, and virtual worlds for the next few years. In Q1, for this new segment, our increased losses were due to lower results in video games. Our unit sales for video games were up somewhat but competition and the difficult market put pressure on pricing. We also saw higher unit cost of sales and marketing expenses on video games in the quarter. As Bob and I have indicated, we expect the difficult economic environment to continue. Having said that, room reservations at our domestic resorts for fiscal Q2 and Q3 are currently running slightly ahead of prior year, with strength in Q3 more than offsetting a slight decrease in Q2. The Easter holiday falls in Q3 this year, versus fiscal Q2 last year, which helps explain this disparity between the quarters. The strength in these bookings is coming from Walt Disney World on the success of our Buy Four Get Three Free promotion. Of course this promotion is resulting in greater discounting for these reservations. Given the success of the promotion, we have extended the booking window to March 29, and as of this coming Monday we will increase the travel window from June 27 to August 15. There is no question that the tough environment has an impact on our parks business. At the same time, the relatively modest attendance declines in the first quarter and the success of this promotion, also help demonstrate the differentiated appeal of our theme parks and resorts and the content they feature. We continue to see weakness in the ad market. Ad pacings at our TV stations are significantly behind last year, in part due to the lack of political spending in this year\u2019s fiscal Q2. At the network scatter pricing is running slightly above up-front pricing but the pace of sales for Q2 is still below this time last year. At ESPN pacing thus far in Q2 versus the prior year are slightly behind the comparison we saw in Q1. Pacings at ABC Family are up so far in Q2. In our Consumer Products businesses we are well positioned with strong license character properties. However, a persistent slowdown in the retail environment does impact our results of retail and over time, our earned royalties. Like others, we are faced with a tough environment. In responding, our focus is on managing with financial discipline, including reducing costs where prudent. At the same time we are also pursuing investments in additional high-quality products, increased innovation, and future growth. Disney\u2019s brand strength and unmatched assets provide tremendous competitive advantages that will help us weather this economic cycle and we believe they position us well to deliver long-term growth and value to investors. With that, I will turn back to Lowell for Q&A.\nLowell Singer: We are ready for the first question.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jessica Reif-Cohen - BAS-ML.\nJessica Reif-Cohen - BAS-ML: Bob, you said you plan to spend less on films, do you mean you are spending less per film or overall in the film business?  And Tom, can you discuss the free cash flow outlook for the year?\nRobert A. Iger: Our goal is to openly spend less in total on films but because we are making fewer films and there is a greater percentage of those films that are what we call [ten fold] the average price for a film isn\u2019t necessarily going down significantly. We do believe, though, that the cost of both producing the DVDs, distributing and marketing the DVDs, needs to be addressed and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing with an eye toward not only reducing the cost and what I will call the investment in extras for the DVD, but also focused on improving the price to value in relationships. For instance, we are finding that when we sell a blue-ray DVD with a standard DEP file and also a downloadable file, we can actually offer a price to the consumer that is viewed by the consumer as delivering greater value, which is enabling us to drive revenue at a level that is slightly better than we might have if we had not added those basically valuable extras to the DVD.  But definitely cost of basically the system needs to come down.\nThomas O. Staggs: On free cash flow I won\u2019t guidance per se, the biggest determinate, of course, will be the operating results as we go through the year. I would say a couple of things about investment. There are a couple of places where we are making investments, first of all in the programming side. I expect to invest a little more in programming at ABC given the strike last year, on a year-over-year basis. We continue to invest in programming at the Disney channels around the world. On the capital side we are investing in increased capacity up at Pixar and we\u2019re putting some money into that this year. And on the park side, the major drivers, I would expect capital expenditures to be up somewhat, because we are investing in California venture, which we talked about last year. we continue to invest in the new ships that are due for the cruise business, in a couple of year. and we also continue to invest in vacation club facilities. So as both Bob and I mentioned, we continue to try to make sure that we are being disciplined about our investments, that we are putting investment towards quality product that we think cuts through the clutter and on assets that we think will drive long-term growth for the company. And so that you should expect to continue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: On the parks front, Tom, I think you said that hotel spending was up modestly in the quarter and we obviously saw the impact of the promotions, the Buy Four Get Three Free, which you have extended. Is that how you think you will see hotel spending pace for the rest of the year, obviously within some kind of a range. I guess what I\u2019m trying to understand is do you think this offer in the market sort of keeps us in that range going forward. And then secondly, on the DVD side, I think we are all struggling with figuring how much of this cyclical versus secular. To some extent the DVD business really fell off last year, as retail overall fell off. I was wondering if you have any view on how Walmart\u2019s activity or overall shelf space at retail for the DVD business might have been responsible for some of the numbers we have seen and whether that changes or can be changed as we head in through 2009.\nThomas O. Staggs: I will give you one note on the spending. I did mention that per-room spending was roughly on par with the prior year in Q1. Bear in mind that the Buy Four Get Three Free promotion did not have travel periods in the first quarter, so that promotion did not impact guest spending or ADRs in the first quarter and that remains to be seen. I talked about you have got Q2, Q3 we are up in room reservations on the books. Those room reservations have more discount in them than you would have seen at this point last year and I think that will show up in the ADR as we report Q2 and Q3 later in the year.\nRobert A. Iger: So regarding DVDs and whether we are cyclical or secular change, I think it is clear that the economy has an impact on DVD sales. And if you look at sales for the year, they worsened in the fourth calendar quarter, or our first fiscal quarter, significantly, suggesting that maybe there was a direct correlation between the cataclysmic events that occurred around the beginning of that quarter and DVD sales. However, we have been taking a hard look at this business for awhile with the belief that as consumer choice grows, and we all know this to be true, if you look at the availability of games online as a for instance, or videos in multiple places, or multi-channel TV, you name it. That pressure on the business has only grown. And that consumers can afford, because of all that choice, to simply be more selective and potentially to buy things that they believe that they believe they are absolutely going to want to watch instead of things that might just be nice to have. Just as a for instance, the average U.S. DVD household owns about 80 DVDs already and the avid movie buyer or user at home that has DVD player owns somewhere in the neighborhood of 135 to 140. That suggests that economy or not, that going forward people potentially will be more selective about what they buy because they already own a pretty decent collection. So we are mindful of that. We believe that there are some secular changes affecting that business. We can\u2019t quantify it. We can\u2019t point, for instance, just at shelf space issues.  Then to reference your question about Walmart. That is necessarily a key ingredient that is obviously something we are also watching very carefully. What we believe we need to do is we need to be mindful of these changes, to address it when it comes to our cost structure. We have been focused a lot on the Disney brand because we believe that really does give us an advantage and we think it shows in both our conversion rates and in our pricing where we have slight advantages, and really be careful about the timing of product that we put into the marketplace and generally speaking, we need to be even more selective about what we choose to make and what we choose to distribute.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Does this change your view on Day-and-Date and Video on Demand at all?\nRobert A. Iger: Well, by view on Day-and-Date, which was pretty radical about three years ago, has modified somewhat over time so I don\u2019t know that it necessarily changes my view at all. I\u2019m not advocating being more aggressive on the windowing right now, I\u2019m advocating being more focused on the cost of the system and being more focused on the quality of the marketing and making sure we deliver the right price to value relationship. What it does confirm, though, is that, particularly when it comes to library product because we saw that in 2008 while library product was somewhat flat with where it was in 2007, there seemed to be some trends that, from a pricing perspective, we need to be mindful of. But when you bring a deep Disney DVD out and create an event out of that, not only is it something that can drive traffic to a mass retailer, which is obviously helpful, but it seems to be something that consumers are still willing to pay a decent price for, rather than buying lots of library product in two-for-$5 or two-for-$10 discount bins. So we like where we are positioned there with the Disney brand and a limited library and an event strategy. And that will continue to be our focus.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Spencer Wang - Credit Suisse.\nSpencer Wang - Credit Suisse: Bob, you mentioned earlier that you were taking a close look at costs and they were mostly being handled at divisional level, but maybe you could quantify if there is some sort of target number you are hoping to achieve in fiscal 2009. And, Tom, at cable networks were there any affiliate revenue deferrals in the quarter and secondly, did you size the bad debt charge at broadcasting?\nRobert A. Iger: We have been spending, as a lot of companies have, a lot of time exploring or analyzing our cost structure and this is clearly a time that demands that, and also an opportunity to really look not just at cost but at the overall structure of our businesses and by restructuring, crate efficiencies and simply become better at what we do. And this is across the board.  Some announcements have already been made. You probably read about. Some you will see in the months ahead. We are not going to quantify what our target is in terms of our overall cost reduction. By the way, it\u2019s more than just the business units, it\u2019s at the corporate level as well. But I can tell you that the number is going to be very significant.  Because not only do these times demand that but we just feel that it is really appropriate for us to take a look at a number of issues that go beyond, as I mentioned, just an economic downturn. The feeling being that when the economy rebounds, which it inevitably will, the normal that we see isn\u2019t necessarily going to look like the normal that we were used to. And that is probably because of some of the secular changes that we have referenced. So we are being very aggressive, we\u2019re very responsible. Maybe in due course we will be a little bit more specific about the number. Other than to tell you that it is quite significant I don\u2019t think it would be appropriate, since a lot of this is a work in progress, to get any more detailed.\nThomas O. Staggs: With regard to revenue deferrals at ESPN, incremental deferral of deferred revenue in Q1 was not a big factor in the quarter. One thing to bear in mind, by the way, when you think about the first quarter for ESPN, it\u2019s actually the quarter in which the relationship between advertising revenues to deferred revenues is highest because we defer some [inaudible] revenues and we have a big quarter in terms of advertising because we have a lot of football in the quarter that drives a fair amount of advertising revenue. In broadcasting, you asked about the charge that we took with regard to the bankruptcy filing. That was about $60.0 million.\nRobert A. Iger: And I just want to come back to one thing regarding cost reductions. Clearly there have been and there will be reduction of personnel. The cost reductions that I speak of, though, go well beyond that and encompass a number of other things, like reducing the cost of distributions, production, marketing, etc. And so it is an across the board process that does not just involve eliminating jobs.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Securities.\nDouglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Securities: Tom, you mentioned for ESPN that the NFL was some pressure on costs. I thought that was just a standard amortization increase each year. so if you could explain why the NFL was benched into this year. and at theme parks you mentioned hotel bookings up slightly for Q2, Q3. How is the drive-up attendance correlated with the hotel bookings? Has that been pretty similar? And should we think of Easter as a 4% shift from Q3 to Q2?\nThomas O. Staggs: With regard to the NFL, because the ESPN was down modestly, the driver there being higher cost, I was just trying to enumerate where the cost increases were. NFL was one of those places. It wasn\u2019t an anomalous year, it\u2019s the normal amortization schedule you have come to expect. We\u2019re just trying to illuminate where those things come from. When you say drive up attendance, when you look at theme park attendance, the resident sector has tended to be among the softness, in terms of attendance origin. And that has been true in prior downturns, it\u2019s true this last quarter. Although I will say that annual pass attendance at Disney Land has been quite good. I think there you\u2019ve got folks that are really attracted to the value of an annual pass visit to Disney Land. And that\u2019s has held up relatively well. But in terms of the otherwise residence attendance, that\u2019s been the softer piece of it. So in answer to your question, it doesn\u2019t correlate very well necessarily with occupancy trends.\nRobert A. Iger: If you look at our advanced bookings and our recent attendance experience, what it suggests to us is that demand for that product is still really robust but as you would expect in these tough economic times, the demand is tied pretty much to price as well. And we have decided that it was important for us to satisfy that demand and to address the economic issues that the world is facing, with reduced pricing rather than try to maintain prices and ultimately not attract as many people as possible. The experience that people have when they visit our parks is one that is very good for our brand. There is also a strong word-of-mouth factor as well. People who go tell other people what their experience was, etc., and so on. And so, keeping the pump primed, so to speak, is very important for this business. Even though it has resulted in some reduction in margins for us.\nThomas O. Staggs: On the Easter shift, think of it this way. Last year when you had an Easter shift, it moved about $40.0 million of operating income from one quarter to the other. Depending on the pace of business this year, we will be in that same ballpark, I would guess.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Imran Khan - J.P. Morgan.\nImran Khan - J.P. Morgan: On ESPN, I am trying to better understand what are some of the initiatives you can take to potentially reduce some of the cost structure in ESPN and whether you are taking or not on those areas.  And secondly, Interactive segment is roughly 3% of the revenue and I am assuming you are breaking it down because you expect it to grow and you talked about investment in this area. Can you help us understand what kind of investment you are talking about, and the growth, whether it will be organic or acquisitions?\nRobert A. Iger: On the ESPN front, clearly you can\u2019t do much in terms of your long-term commitment to sports rights. Although they have been more selective over the past few years on what rights they buy. You can reduce your cost of production somewhat but the quality of that production is a pretty important ingredient to the quality of the view experience and brand equity. We have reduced somewhat some of our investments in certain areas, or slowed them down mostly, or delayed. We continue to invest in new media for instance, but at a slightly slower pace. But the new media component of ESPN is also deemed pretty important, not only to in current day brand equity and experience, but in future growth. So the cost reductions at ESPN I would call, compared with some of the potential cost reductions in our other businesses, relatively modest and across the board. In other words, when I say that I mean from here and there as opposed to a significant reduction from any one specific area.\nThomas O. Staggs: With regard to Interactive Media let me see if I can frame the investment for you a little bit. First of all, most of the investment we are making in that business shows up on the expense line. The capital part of the equation is not terribly significant and part of the reason for that is if we expense the production and development costs as gains as they are incurred. I would expect to see the investment in 2009 be up somewhat from 2008. The biggest driver of that will likely be increased investment in the games business, so in the development of games. We invested about $170.0 million in video game development last year. I think that in the neighborhood of $40.0 million to $50.0 million more of investment this year is probably in the right ballpark on that one. We will also see increased investment in Disnsey.com as we build out its both branding and CRM capabilities, as Bob referenced, although a much more modest pace of the increase in the investment there. And then our investment in Virtual World will continue and I think we will ramp up somewhat. We believe that is a business that can ramp to profitability actually reasonably quickly and show some nice returns for us. of course, Club Hangman is already profitable but I think there is more for us there in that property and in the other properties that we are developing. Those are the large projects. We also have mobile content and services initiatives. There we will make some incremental investment, but again, that\u2019s one that I think that you will see ramp to profitability relatively quickly. So we feel good about where we\u2019re going, but again, there\u2019s increased investment on the horizon this year and we will continue to invest for the next couple of years before we start to show that being a driver of growth for the company overall.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Nathanson - Sanford C. Bernstein.\nMichael Nathanson - Sanford C. Bernstein: Bob, just going back to Imran\u2019s question, what percentage of the cost base would you characterize as programming [inaudible] investment?\nRobert A. Iger: We don\u2019t break down the rights component versus the production or the investment component at ESPN. Except I can say that given the cost of rights to certain high quality, very popular events, you would expect that rights cost, generally speaking, is the largest component of ESPN\u2019s expense structure.\nMichael Nathanson - Sanford C. Bernstein: On cable networks, the past few years you have grown your affiliate use to double digits. In the near term do you think do you think that\u2019s still achievable?\nRobert A. Iger: We have deals that are locked in for the next few years and we are just starting to have discussions with some of the large cable operators about extending those deals. But it\u2019s way too early to either discuss or predict just what the rates will be. Our investment in those brands, those programs, has clearly paid off. Just look at the results at ABC Family, at Disney Channel, at ESPN. And we are finding in our discussions with the operators, while there is pressure on cost for everyone, including them, something that we need to be mindful of, the popularity of our channels is clearly delivering value for them in making their multi-service business attractive to their customers. But also it is providing value to them, particularly at ESPN, their ability to sell local ads.\nMichael Nathanson - Sanford C. Bernstein: The fuel hedge, have you benefited from previous years with a fuel hedge and what is the risk if fuel prices stay where they are that there are future quarters of large market losses?\nThomas O. Staggs: If fuel prices stay where they are, there wouldn\u2019t be any more mark-to-market on those particular hedges. That\u2019s by nature of the hedges taken at a price that was higher than the price fell to and therefore there was an embedded loss in the hedge. The accounting for hedges on fuel isn\u2019t the same as accounting for certain other financial instruments for the deemed hedge effectiveness, so it\u2019s a mark-to-market kind of item. So if you felt that fuel was going to drop materially from these levels, and I\u2019m not making any such prediction, then you would essentially have more exposure on those fuel hedges. But at this point I don\u2019t expect that to be true. This is the largest sort of swing from a fuel hedge mark-to-market that I can recall, certainly by a large measure. But of course, this is the largest amount of volatility we have seen in fuel in recent memory.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Wienkes - Goldman Sachs.\nMark Wienkes - Goldman Sachs: Let\u2019s see if we can get to the cable nets in another way. Given what you know for affiliate fee growth, over the next couple of years, or even just this year, and your plans for opex, if the cable network advertising doesn\u2019t change from where it\u2019s pacing now at ESPN and Family Center, can net net\u2019s EBITDA be flat for the full year ?\nThomas O. Staggs: As you might expect, I\u2019m not going to speculate on what might happen in a certain set of circumstance because there are a lot of moving parts to all these equations. As you saw, there was some softness in the results of cable this last quarter. A big chunk of that was due to the High School Musical 2 DVD.\nRobert A. Iger: It was just a pass-back. That\u2019s just from the studio to the Disney Channel.\nThomas O. Staggs: That they had last year that they didn\u2019t have this year. so that actually entered into the equation. But the end line point is that while there is softness in the ad markets, there is great resilience in our cable nets, both by virtue of their structure being more skewed toward affiliate fees than towards advertising, obviously. Disney Channel in the extreme. ESPN also but to a somewhat lesser extent. So we feel extremely good about how they\u2019re positioned and extremely good about their ability to perform in a difficult environment. Both in terms of their response on cost, as Bob mentioned, but also just in terms of the basic business structure that they have. Now, ESPN, there are certain of its categories that are important and, automotive is an example, have gone through some difficult times and so that has had somewhat more of an impact than we would have liked. But going forward, I wouldn\u2019t trade our portfolio of cable assets for any other.\nMark Wienkes - Goldman Sachs: And you don\u2019t have the HSM2 comp and the ratio, as you said, for advertising relative to affiliate fees actually improves Q2, Q3.\nThomas O. Staggs: Right.\nMark Wienkes - Goldman Sachs: Given the broader softness we saw at retail across the board, could you comment on the drivers of flat earn royalty revenue in consumer products in Q1 and how that has trended post the holiday?\nThomas O. Staggs: We can try to illuminate a little bit. The earned royalties, which is the measure that we watch most closely in licensing, as we mentioned, were roughly flat in the first quarter. The key to that is that we have very strong properties that commanded a fair amount of shelf space by retailers and so that helped us on the royalty side there. Now, as we go forward, and the retail environment perhaps stays soft, that could impact the pace of reorders and while, again as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we feel really good about the strength of the franchises underpinning our licensing business, and the pace of retail can have an impact.  Over time we continue, and I think Bob mentioned a couple of the franchises that we continued, plus in the sequels that we have in the works, etc., over time our aim is to continue to build up and add to our stable of properties to continue to bolster this business. And so, that to me, in the medium to long term, looks very good. The other thing I would say is that one thing we saw in the quarter was there was some shift away from toys towards other categories of merchandise and so the franchises that we saw that were heavier in toys were somewhat softer than those that were heavier in apparel and those types of things.  So those kinds of shifts may continue. But at the end of the day, we\u2019re diversified across those categories in a way that we feel quite good about.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Morris- UBS.\nMichael Morris - UBS: At the ABC Network, can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing right now in terms of year-over-year ad pacings? And also, what are you seeing with respect to options being taken right now on up-front sales for the coming quarter and what do you think that means in terms of how you approach the up-front this year? And also, over at the parks segment, the promotion looks like it\u2019s successful in terms of driving traffic. Can you give a little more color on specifically what you\u2019re giving up in the Seven For the Price of Four, with respect to the price of a ticket and what you are giving up in terms of hotel revenue.\nThomas O. Staggs: On the ABC Network, as I mentioned, we can see the scatter pricing, which is still up from the up-front, but the pace continues to be down on an overall basis. and remember that in the second quarter the scatter pricing is only a piece and a smaller piece of the pie. So on an overall look you are still looking at pacings that have high-single digits off versus the prior year, so not that bad. Options. The option pickup for Q3, which is the one that is going on right now, or just finishing up right now, that\u2019s coming in slightly lower than what you might otherwise have expected but not to the extent that we are alarmed about it. We are seeing a little more hold back in consumer goods and to a lesser extent pharmaceuticals, with some shrinks in some other categories. And so there is no question, it\u2019s a soft ad market. The strongest properties are selling pretty well and I think that Mike Shaw and his team are doing a very good job of making the most of a difficult market.\nRobert A. Iger: And to give you some flavor on the Four Plus Three discount, basically the discount on the ticket is relatively modest because we put in place three years ago a pricing strategy that made it cheaper, from a ticket perspective, the more days you bought or the more days you stayed. So there was a real incentive if you were considering staying for four days to buy seven days and the cost of the extra tickets were that much lower because at that point what we got from you was we got a longer length of stay and higher hotel revenue. In this particular case the way to look at it is the discount on the ticket is modest, as I mentioned. The discount on the hotel obviously is significant because you\u2019re getting three nights for free. And that was not part of the previous pricing strategy that we had in place. That said, when you look at our bookings in the current quarter and the bookings for next quarter, at Orlando for instance, where we have the lion\u2019s share of our hotels and drive the most attendance, we are up nicely in this quarter and next on a bookings basis from the similar quarters last year, suggesting that this is a promotion or pricing strategy that is really working.  And to the point I made earlier, our goal right now is to keep people coming to Walt Disney World and Disney Land. Clearly there is a benefit to that, as I mentioned, from a brand perspective, but when they stay longer they obviously spend more beyond just the ticket and the hotel room. And that is of value to us in this economy.\nMichael Morris - UBS: When we talk about being slightly ahead of last year, what is your comfort level with what you can see now versus where we will actually come in? do you feel comfortable that you will actually come in ahead at this point?\nRobert A. Iger: Are you asking about park bookings?\nMichael Morris - UBS: Yes, exactly.\nThomas O. Staggs: We can only tell you what the pace of bookings is at this point. We are loathe to predict what that means ultimately. I think we are encouraged by the strength of those bookings. I mentioned that we are extending the promotion so that the travel window will extend to August 15. But it remains to be seen.\nRobert A. Iger: Let\u2019s also not lose sight of the fact that fiscal 2008 was a tremendous year for our parks, particularly Orlando. I think it was the second biggest year we have ever had. It was the biggest year in attendance that we\u2019ve ever had. By a nice margin. And the comparisons that we are making are all to the biggest year Orlando ever had. The other thing that we have to be mindful of is that not only our results but our attendance and our bookings through October 1 were really significant. We held up, that business held up very well with little, if any, discounting. And eventually this economy, as we have seen in a number of businesses, has to catch up with you and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re experiencing. And again, we are actually pleased with what we are seeing at our parks because it confirms that we\u2019ve got a great product and the demand remains unbelievably strong. There\u2019s not much we can do about the economy except address the expense side. We would have a huge problem if we didn\u2019t have the demand, if there was something wrong with the product. It would take us a lot longer to fix that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Richard Greenfield - Pali Research.\nRichard Greenfield - Pali Research: Getting back to this ESPN issue, if you were to back out, or the cable network issue in general, when you look at the 2% increase in revenues and the 12% decrease in operating income, can you give us a sense of what that would look like for each of those if it weren\u2019t for the comp issue related to High School Musical 2? Would you have been up mid-single digits or a couple percent more? And how much would that have cut down, I assume the margin impact was far greater than the revenue impact on the year-over-year basis. Two housekeeping issues, one, on something like ABC.com, those shows that are streamed on that, are the revenues now booked within the television division, or broadcasting, and the cost is now with Interactive? How does that all work given the various activities of all your businesses online and offline? And attendance, you didn\u2019t mention, what is attendance up or down through February 2, 2009, on a quarter-to-date basis?\nRobert A. Iger: First of all, on the attendance front, attendance for this quarter that we\u2019re in at Walt Disney World is actually up mid-single digits versus the same quarter a year ago and Disney Land is up double digits this quarter versus a year ago. Now, we\u2019re only a month into the quarter, but you wanted Q2. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m giving you. Clearly, at Walt Disney World the attendance increase should be the result of the Four Plus Three discount that we have in the marketplace. So we are actually seeing some nice attendance trends. Interestingly enough, if you look at attendance at Walt Disney World since October 1, it\u2019s only down 2% and Disney Land is flat year-to-year since October 1. So we have a relatively nice attendance story to tell.\nThomas O. Staggs: On cable, if it weren\u2019t for the High School Musical 2 DVD comparison, the cable networks would have still been down, but very modestly in the quarter. \nRobert A. Iger: We also had a very strong first quarter for ESPN in sales a year ago.\nThomas O. Staggs: They were up double-digit percentages a year ago in advertising.\nRobert A. Iger: To help you on the Interactive revenue and costs, the revenue that comes in for ABC shows streamed on the Internet or ABC shows purchased on iTunes, that goes directly to ABC or the Media Networks. Any cost involved in what I will call delivering the show, you know, there are residuals, etc. and so on, that is obviously borne by ESPN. The Internet group provides some backbone, mostly on the technology front to all of our businesses, to ESPN, to the Disney businesses, to ABC, but most of that is allocated back to the business unit. It is allocated back to the business unit. And there is marketing expense as well and that is borne by the business unit directly. But the revenue largely goes directly to the business unit. \nRichard Greenfield - Pali Research: On this attendance issue, when you look at international, given what\u2019s happened to the pound and all the foreign currency, especially in Europe, what are you seeing in terms of forward bookings from overseas?\nRobert A. Iger: I won\u2019t break down foreign bookings, I will break down attendance today. As Tom mentioned in his remarks, if I recall, international attendance is still up versus last year. the numbers are actually international attendance Walt Disney World is up versus last year. Disney Land is down modestly. But Disney World international attendance is up. We won\u2019t break down the bookings by region yet, although Tom mentioned from an attendance perspective what we\u2019re seeing is that what I will call local, or resident, is the one that is the softest.\nThomas O. Staggs: It remains to be seen where the dollar goes from here and what the strength of the dollar means as the difficult environment ripples through other economies so we want to be careful not to make predictions on that. I will give you one footnote on the trends in attendance in the second quarter. It\u2019s important to remember that the second quarter, when it\u2019s all said and done, won\u2019t have the benefit of Easter and so the attendance comparisons will suffer as a result.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Alan Gould - Natixis Bleichroeder.\nAlan Gould - Natixis Bleichroeder: On ESPN, if I think of long-term margins in that business, are affiliate fees increasing at the same rate, quicker, or slower than programming costs at ESPN.\nThomas O. Staggs: What we have said in the past and it remains true, is that we believe that the pace we have locked in for affiliate fee increases is one that we can leverage to grow profits over time, given the business as a whole, even considering the expected pace of increase in programming costs. So we think that continues to be a leveragable business model. Obviously the advertising revenues being down this quarter impacted it for this Q1, although bear in mind, Q1 is the lowest profit quarter for ESPN because of the NFL and the deferral of affiliate fees.\nAlan Gould - Natixis Bleichroeder: And what were the ESPN receivable reserves that you talked about? Is it charter or can you say? How much were they?\nThomas O. Staggs: You guessed right. And in cable it came to about $25.0 million, over and above that particular instance.\nAlan Gould - Natixis Bleichroeder: You had $25.0 million in cable and you had the $60.0 million in broadcasting.\nThomas O. Staggs: Yes, different cuts [inaudible-overtalk] .\nAlan Gould - Natixis Bleichroeder: And lastly, on the video side, can you tell us how many video units you sold in the first fiscal quarter this year versus the first fiscal quarter of last year?\nThomas O. Staggs: We haven\u2019t given out exact numbers of video units, in part because the titles that are in the market in any given quarter make those comparison very difficult to interpret. But I mentioned in the comments, the units were down. That was easily the biggest driver of the lower result of the studio for the quarter. So you can surmise, they are double-digit percentages. The biggest drive, of course, the comparison Pirates of the Caribbean 3 versus the most comparable this quarter being Prince Caspian. So that alone had a very big impact on the units we sold.\nOperator: Your final question comes from David Miller - Caris & Company.\nDavid Miller - Caris & Company: Tom, you had said three months ago on your Q4 call that you had suspended all stock repurchasing activity. It looks like from the share count here that you have resumed that. Can you just shed a little color on that? It looks like the liquidity situation obviously improved, as witnessed by your debt deal that you did on December 17, and if you can touch on that it would be great. And also, as you know, here in California, Governor Schwarzenegger is talking about proposing roughly a 10% tax on all sports/entertainment items which would include theme parks. I assume that would include Disney Land. And if that piece of legislation passes are you more prone to pay that out of your own pocket or to pass on some short of cost increase to consumers?\nThomas O. Staggs: Bob is looking at me wondering whether I started buying shares back without telling him again. No, we have not resumed repurchasing shares. The share count, remember, is on fully diluted shares. That\u2019s probably what you are looking at and the extent that you have a decrease in the stock price, the number of in-the-money options would go down and therefore you could see a decrease in your fully diluted share count.\nRobert A. Iger: On the ticket tax, we provided the state with what we think is a pretty comprehensive, incredible analysis that suggests strongly that a tax on tickets, particularly theme parks but also on sporting events, would actually cost the state money, that it could have a negative effect on ticket purchases if the cost is passed back to the consumer and that would result in less spending in the state overall and less taxes paid in aggregate. With that answer I am suggesting that if there is such a tax, it is likely that we would have to pass that tax on to our consumers but we have made no decisions about that at all. We are going to remain hopefully optimistic that such a tax is not going to be levied. At least on the theme park business.\nLowell Singer: Thanks again, everyone, for joining us today.

My name is Amity, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.\nLowell Singer: Thank you, Amity. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Walt Disney Company's Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued a few minutes ago. It's now available on our Web site at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast, and the webcast will also be available on our Web site. And after the call, a replay and a transcript will be available there as well. Joining me in Burbank for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob's going to lead off, followed by Jay. And then we'll be happy to take your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob, and we'll get started.\nRobert Iger: Thank you very much, Lowell, and good afternoon. Let me start off by saying how thrilled we are with the global success of Iron Man 2, which to date has grossed $334 million in global box office. It makes me even more enthusiastic about the great things Marvel and Disney can do together to build the value of the Marvel brand, its array of great characters and about our upcoming Marvel movies, Thor and Captain America.  Our strong second quarter performance was driven in part by Disney's Alice in Wonderland. This visually stunning and highly entertaining motion picture has, to date, grossed over $962 million in global box office, making it Disney's second highest performing film ever, both U.S. and worldwide, and the number seven movie of all time. And we're excited, too, about our upcoming summer slate, which includes Prince of Persia, Toy Story 3 and Sorcerer's Apprentice.  Under the new studio leadership, a focus on franchise films, such as Toy Story 3, is an important part of our growth strategy. And as we've discussed before, when a franchise film is successful at Disney, many of our businesses benefit, driving superior returns. With sequels of Cars, Pirates and Monsters, Inc. arriving over the next two fiscal years, the opportunities to create additional value from these properties are tremendous. At our Media Networks, we're continuing to build on our strengths. ESPN has invested in the world's most exciting sports events and presents them in an integrated and engaging way. The NBA Finals are a great example of how ESPN weaves live sports, great reporting and up-to-the-minute stats into a compelling, cross-platform package that serves both consumers and advertisers. We're planning the same for the upcoming FIFA World Cup in South Africa. ESPN's innovation and emphasis on quality continue to drive strong ratings, and I'm particularly proud of the work ESPN has done in digital media.  We are just a week away from the announcement of ABC's fall primetime schedule. I'm confident in the team's long-term track record and its ability to develop great new shows, like the current Wednesday night comedy block, and to generate new excitement along around long-standing series such as Dancing with the Stars, Grey's Anatomy and The Bachelor. With the scatter market strong, we are anticipating a very good upfront market.  We're also pleased with the creative strengths of Disney Channel and ABC Family, which continue to perform exceptionally well with great original programming. Disney Channel has new hits in Phineas and Ferb and Good Luck Charlie, while Disney XD is building share among its target audience of boys. Both are international presence that's bringing the Disney brand into people's homes throughout the world.  We're also developing a Marvel block of programs for our XD channel. For its part, ABC family is doing an excellent job of winning over Millennials, a particularly sought-after demographic. At our Parks and Resorts, over the next two years, a magnificent new resort will open in Hawaii, two new cruise ships will set sail and expansion of Disneyland Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland are coming along nicely. The rollout of our additions and improvements to Disney's California Adventure begins next month with World of Color, an exciting nighttime spectacular. The Disney Dream, the first of our new ships, will embark on its maiden voyage in the early part of calendar 2011. Together, these investments and our continuing emphasis on providing guests distinctive, high-quality experiences should serve Disney well as the economy improves, allowing a return to more normal pricing. Jay will elaborate later. Our strategy is to create the best in branded entertainment; to use technology, both to make that entertainment more compelling and to reach more people; and to expand Disney's presence and promising global markets. But we've also taken steps to improve our operational agility and to challenge long-standing business models in order to better serve consumers.  The creation of exciting new devices like the iPad, the growth of social media platforms and the choice demanded by consumers in how and when they enjoy their entertainment, offers incredible opportunities for companies like Disney strong brands, quality creative content and a willingness to be innovative and aggressive in the way content is created, marketed and distributed. As the economy improves, I'm pleased the approach we've taken continues to be paying off. We were resilient during the downturn and laid the groundwork for future growth through our acquisition of Marvel and our continued investments in media and at our Parks and Resorts. Success rests on our continued ability to create quality content, to manage costs carefully and to be disciplined in our strategy and nimble in our execution.  And with that, I'd like to turn things over to Jay.\nJames Rasulo: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid Q2 results with growth in revenue, operating income and earnings per share. The economy continues to improve, and this is benefiting our businesses to varying degrees. Studio Entertainment was the largest driver of our year-over-year increase in operating income in Q2. Our theatrical releases, particularly Alice in Wonderland, strongly outperformed last year's slate, contributing to higher results. In addition to Iron Man 2, as Bob mentioned, our summer releases, including Prince of Persia, Toy Story 3 and Sorcerer's Apprentice, will obviously be key drivers of our performance for the remainder of the year. Results at Media Networks came in flat to last year's Q2. At Cable Networks, higher affiliate and advertising revenue at ESPN more than offset an increase in costs coming primarily from sports rights for premier league football in the U.K., college basketball and the NBA. ESPN's ad revenues were up by mid-single-digit percentage points in the quarter. Due to a shift in our fiscal calendar, 12 college ballgames that were in Q2 last year moved to Q1 this year. We estimate that if these college ballgames had aired in Q2 this year, ESPN's ad revenue would have been a few percentage points higher.  At ESPN, recognition of a portion of our affiliate revenue is dependent on when we deliver a certain quantity of sports programming. You may recall that last year, we achieved some of these programming commitments during our fourth fiscal quarter. This year, we expect to reach more programming commitments in the third quarter. As a result, we currently expect we'll have a year-over-year increase in net affiliate revenue recognition of at least $155 million in Q3.  At Broadcasting, softer primetime ratings and higher programming costs at the ABC Network impacted Q2 results. We also incurred higher production cost amortization related to sales of ABC shows. Scatter pricing came in more than 35% above upfront levels. Ad revenue at our own TV stations came in 20% above prior Q2, led by increases primarily in automotive, political and retail categories. Thus far in Q3, scatter pricing for the ABC Network is running 30% above upfront levels. Ad sales at both ESPN and our TV stations are pacing up by double digits versus prior year.  At Parks and Resorts, operating income came in 12% below prior Q2. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, we've been reducing the depth of our promotional offers. We have done this with the expectation that we will make near-term trade-offs between rate and volume. In Q2, we saw an improvement in both guest and per-room spending but a decline in occupied rooms. Attendance at our domestic parks came in 4% lower than prior-year levels, with Walt Disney World down 6% and Disneyland flat.  As we mentioned previously, Q2 had shifts in two holiday weeks in the fiscal year. New Year's week moved from Q2 to Q1 and one week of Easter holiday moved into Q2 from Q3. We estimate that without these calendar shifts, combined attendance was nearly flat to the prior year. Per capita guest spending was up by 5%. Occupancy at our Orlando hotels came in eight percentage points lower than prior-year levels at 81%, while Anaheim occupancy was down two percentage point at 67%. Per-room spending at our hotels came in 8% above prior-year levels, with an increase at Walt Disney World and a decline at our Disneyland resorts.  Results at our Cruise Line were affected by increased fuel costs and higher promotional activities. For the segment as a whole, savings from lower volume-related expenses and cost mitigation activities help to partially offset higher expenses from inflation and pension and post-retirement medical costs. Q3 hotel reservations on the books are pacing 10% behind prior year. Again, we are not surprised by this since we are beginning to return to more normalized pricing levels. During fiscal 2011, we expect to no longer widely offer the deep discounts we've had in the market over the last 18 months. At Consumer Products, the increase in operating income was driven by higher results at licensing, publishing and the Disney stores. Licensing revenue benefited from strong retailer response to Toy Story merchandise. Marvel properties added to segment licensing revenue, but this gain was largely offset by cost of sales and amortization of intangible assets related to Marvel. Earned licensing revenue grew by 4% on a comparable basis. The increase of publishing reflects growth from Marvel properties. At Disney Stores North America, we saw an improvement in comparable store sales. Given our strong balance sheet and cash flow, we remain committed to buying back the shares we issued for the Marvel acquisition by the end of fiscal 2010. So far this fiscal year, we've repurchased over 11 million shares or roughly $370 million. We are pleased with the results we delivered in the first half of the year. They reflect not only the financial discipline we've maintained through the downturn but also the steps we've taken to become more efficient and position our businesses for long-term growth.  More importantly, we've done this while maintaining our focus on creating high-quality branded entertainment and investing in key growth initiatives that we believe will position us to continue to deliver shareholder value.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Lowell.\nLowell Singer: Okay, thanks, Jay. Amity, we are ready to start the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jessica Reif-Cohen with Bank of America.\nJessica Reif-Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch: You haven't said anything about the Shanghai park. I was wondering if you could tell us if there's anything holding that up? Does that have anything to do with you starting up a Disney Channel in China? And then secondly, could you talk about the cost curve for ESPN over the next few years?\nRobert Iger: There's no news on the Shanghai Park, Jessica. Since we announced that we had reached a framework agreement with the government and received the necessary approval from Beijing, our next task was to negotiate basically a detailed agreement with the Shanghai government and that process is underway. And we are not making predictions as to when it will conclude, except to say that it's moving along on a timely basis. And there's no direct tie to a channel in China. As for the cost structure of ESPN, we don't specify just how that will grow, in part because there are contracts that expire over the next few years with certain sports organizations. And until those are negotiated or until it's determined just whether we will negotiate extensions of those deals, we really can't predict just what the cost structure will be. The big deals with the NFL, the NBA, Major League Baseball and NASCAR all run through 2013 to 2016. And you can expect that there are increases in all of those contracts. But again, we don't specify just what those are. And there are a number of other agreements that we have that will expire during that period of time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.\nSpencer Wang: Just to follow up on the question about ESPN costs, Jay, could you, perhaps, quantify for us how large the costs were for the new channel in the U.K. within the quarter? And then secondly, for Bob, with some of the recent chatter about CNN and CBS news, perhaps, doing something jointly, could you just share with us your thoughts on where you can take costs out on the news side or what you would do strategically there?\nJames Rasulo: Obviously, we're very much in start-up mode in the U.K. with English Premier League football and rugby and FA league football. I'm not going to specify the specific costs of that operation, but we're in ramp-up. The rights that we had were for about 46 Premier League games this year, about 23 next year, but FA adds a number of games and we'll be at 48 the following year, and then we've picked up rugby. So we're building our brand there. Obviously, we're investing to do so and feel that in the long run, the number of subscribers and the revenue on the top line will more than compensate for that strategy.\nRobert Iger: On the news front, ABC news has just gone through a rather exhaustive analysis and an extensive process to address their costs issues, as well as to focus more on the strategy of gathering and presenting news in a world that has changed a lot, both in terms of how people access that news, but also how technology has enabled us to cover the world differently. And with that, they've taken substantial costs out, Spencer, in a variety of different ways including the substantial reduction in people. The chatter that you referred to about CNN is interesting in that we explored with CNN a few years ago a joint venture. We were unable to conclude an agreement with them. We're not in discussions with them now about something similar. To the question you asked about costs, we are not looking to outsource news at the ABC Television Network. We're going [ph] to outsource news gathering, although we do rely on certain third parties throughout the world to provide certain basically up-to-the-minute or late-breaking news on our behalf.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.\nDouglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG: Jay, you said you're not surprised by the 10% below last year bookings at Park hotels because you're weaning yourself off of discounting. Does that mean your pricing's up 10% and this is a revenue neutral strategy? Or if not, given you've been managing the parks to flat attendants through the recession, why shouldn't we be concerned about a 10% drop now that we're in a recovery?\nJames Rasulo: Well, Doug, I think that the situation we're in right now -- and remember, when I gave this number out last quarter, I said we were 10% down. We wound up the quarter 6% down. And so consumers are still out there waiting for bargains. Quite honestly, I think we're in a bit of a waiting for each other to blink. And we are, as I mentioned last quarter and I'll repeat, we are determined and confident that we can take our pricing back to its normalized levels. So at this point, I'm not surprised that where we are in terms of bookings. I told you in the second quarter we've seen signs of our reduction in pricing both in terms of per capita spending and spending per room, both of which were up, I think, 5% and 8% of the numbers that go with that. And so we feel pretty confident that we're on the right path and that in 2011, we will be back to our sort of normalized level of pricing, which by the way, always includes for some weeks of the year, some discounting and has for time memorial.\nDouglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG: And just to be clear on this point, so to the extent that there might be a short period of time that's disruptive to attendance, it's important to get back to normal pricing and you're willing to go through that stretch, right?\nJames Rasulo: We play the rate and volume and lever that on a daily basis. I don't want to go into how yield management works. It's extremely complicated. We offer different rates every single day of the year and, of course, try to maximize revenue along the way. But what we're talking about here is the longer run, getting back to normalized prices, and I'm pretty confident that, that can happen.\nRobert Iger: And also, I think, Doug, you're inferring something that isn't necessarily going on right now. And that is that we've made a decision to reduce the size of the discount. In doing so, we were pretty certain short-term that was going to reduce volume, but we have increased revenue in the process. And actually, in the very, very recent period, our bookings have actually increased nicely. Now we're now making predictions as to whether that pattern will hold or what will happen through the summer. But we thought after seeing an extremely strong week of bookings, which we did this past week, with the discount being less than it was, that, that is a good sign and perhaps a sign that one, people are planning to vacation more this summer than they did last; two, the closer you get to the summer, the more the urgency to book to make sure you have the right hotel at the right time, et cetera; and that it's possible that we're starting to see signs that the consumer is starting to look past, in effect, the smaller discount in order to take the vacation that they want to take, when they want to take it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBen Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Bob, now that the Marvel deal has closed and you got Iron Man out, and I'm sure you've been looking at how you can exploit that aspect across the Marvel properties across all your different businesses, can you just sort of update us on the things you talked about when you announced the transaction? I think you mentioned licensing, particularly international was a huge opportunity in terms of synergies. I think at the parks there's been some debate about what you can and can't do at the theme parks with the Marvel property, is anything on the video games or on domestic cable nets like Disney XD, would be very helpful now that we're in sort into the acquisition.\nRobert Iger: There's an awful lot of activity going on and it's all good. On the theme park's front, though, we said when we acquired Marvel that there were encumbrances in the United States and in Japan, notably between Marvel and Universal, deals that were done a long time ago. And so Marvel presence in our parks, at least in the short-term, is likely to be somewhat limited in nature. However, in all the other businesses, there's quite a lot of activity. On the games front and in digital media in general, there's been a fair amount of development and discussion. And in fact, as you know, we've gone into the self-publishing business at least on the console side of that business. And we are starting to develop some Marvel properties that will be published by us. We're looking for other opportunities on the games front as well. It's obviously a much more diverse business than just the console business. We're also discussing with Marvel a variety of other digital media strategies, including social networking opportunities, as well as things like mobile apps, and in fact, Marvel launched a great app for the iPad just last month. Licensing is probably where most of the activity is coming. Marvel had a very successful global licensing operation, as do we. There's a significant amount of integration going on, not just in the U.S., but in markets all around the world. Marvel working with Disney teams in places like India and China looking for opportunities in Japan, looking how to both reduce costs and grow licensing revenue in Europe and Latin America. So I'd say that's where the most activity and where the most opportunity is. There's also an opportunity to sell Marvel goods on Disney platforms. You can go to Disney.com to the store, and you'll see that we're selling Iron Man merchandise there. We're looking also for the opportunity to potentially sell Marvel merchandise at our parks. I mentioned in my remarks, we're developing a Marvel block of television programming for Disney XD, and we have two series in production and/or development, and we hope that, that will expand significantly over the next few years. So we think we have a big opportunity in terms of television. And then of course, once the Paramount distribution deal is fulfilled, it's our intention for the Disney Studio to step in and become the global distributor of Marvel's motion pictures and videos. Great opportunity as we cited when we announced the acquisition. I've said a number of times that we're impressed with the Marvel team. And if anything, since the acquisition, I think our enthusiasm has increased because of the quality of their people and the quality of the product and you opportunity to take that product, particularly in a world where technology is more friend than foe and distribute it more readily and in more compelling ways is pretty exciting.\nBen Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: And just Jay, back on ESPN front, this way [ph] we calculate it if we back out the equity affiliate income, your OpEx at ESPN went from, I think it was up 6% in the December quarter and up about 15% in the March quarter. Is that acceleration and cost growth primarily? Or have you been entirely related to the U.K. launch? Or did something else accelerate in the quarter? Any comment there would be appreciated.\nJames Rasulo: Yes, you're right, there are there were some rights fees and there are additional production expenses for some additional events that took place in the course of the year. As I mentioned in my comments, the rights fees were associated with the U.K. soccer and college basketball and sort of the next year of the NBA. And that pretty much covers it.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Imran Khan with JPMorgan.\nImran Khan - JP Morgan Chase & Co: One about ESPN and the other about ABC. ESPN, it seems like looking at some of your competitors in the cable network, they're experiencing pretty strong growth in international market. Can you give us some color how you truly think about ESPN international revenue growth opportunity? And also, can you get to U.S.-level markets in ESPN in the long term? Or do you think that international is a lower-margin business? And with regards to ABC, how should we think about the cost for ABC next season? Does NBC's return to a scripted programming impact programming cost you? Any color would be helpful.\nRobert Iger: We didn't notice any uptick in expenses in ABC at least through the development season that were due to NBC developing more aggressively in the scripted side. Until we choose the programs for the fall and determine how many will be bought, it's difficult to predict what ABC's expense line will be. But there doesn't seem to be any real forces in the marketplace that would suggest that the costs are going to go up. On the ESPN front, as we've said in the past, international growth while continuing, is still relatively difficult to achieve, mostly because in order to really grow a sports platform or channel in these international markets, you have to spend very, very heavily on the most popular sports in each market. And in most cases, in the big markets, you have an embedded platform owner, Sky in the U.K. is a great example of this, that is going after the same rights in order to grow subscriptions to their overall platform. Since we do not own a distribution platform, we actually enter the sports rights market at a relative disadvantage to those that own platforms. So while we're pleased with the growth of ESPN internationally from what had been, basically, a losing business some 5 to 10 years ago to a profitable business, we do not believe that international growth for ESPN can rival that of other U.S.-based cable programs services that either can leverage the programming that they buy in the United States globally or by programs under less competitive circumstances in international markets.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Barclays Capital.\nAnthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital: Jay, I just thought with some of the currencies swings that we\u2019ve seen out there recently in the marketplace, I thought it would be worth asking what is Disney's exposure to the euro and the pound? And are those currencies hedged? And just how do you think about your currency exposure abroad?\nJames Rasulo: We don't have a huge percentage of revenue for our company in Europe, and we are hedged in those currencies from time to time. We're in and out of hedging. I don't see a huge exposure to either of those currencies. As it relates to our business, we find that the business that people always ask about directly related to currency is our Parks and Resorts business, which tends to follow more the strength of the economies around the world than it does changes in currency.\nAnthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital: I guess to follow up a little bit on Doug's question about the Parks, most of us on this call aren't leisure lodging analysts, but it certainly seems like in some other pockets of leisure like for Starwood or Marriott, that they\u2019re starting to see revenue growth and EBITDA growth. And what I hear from some investors is that, that\u2019s a business customer and Disney\u2019s customers primarily are leisure consumer. I'm just wondering in your research have you noticed a tie between the business customer and your consumer at the Parks? And is there any way that we as analysts can assume that a rebound in attendance for your clientele can in anyway predictably follow a rebound that we actually are seeing in other pockets for the business consumer?\nRobert Iger: A couple of things. First of all, the leisure traveler usually has a much longer booking cycle than the business traveler. So when you feel good enough to take a vacation -- good enough I mean economically to take a vacation -- then you\u2019ve got to decide, \"Okay, where am I going and when am I going?\" And quite often for us, of course, that aligns itself with school schedules and people\u2019s available time. And so we would at the very least be a lagger to business travel, which is usually more close-in and immediate in terms of booking. Of course, we do run a sizable group of business, group and convention business, that has a lot of business meetings and we have seen a lift in that business in the second quarter, unmistakable relative to last year. So to that extent, and of course, we see the Starwood and other's numbers as well as you do, but we don't share a huge customer base. Most of those changes you see reporting are primarily business traveler-focused. And I don't think there is a link, but of course, they need leisure travelers for a lot of their weekend business. So as their results improve, quite often you see ours improving as well. But I don't think there's a huge link there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen and Company.\nDouglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC: When I think back to something Pixar said about their pipeline six, seven years ago, they were asked about sequels and one of the things they said was they were really focused on working whatever they thought the best ideas were in their pipeline. You guys announced Monsters 2 recently. And then, Bob, I\u2019m just wondering has this shift to all of a sudden now have three sequels in three years, is that a reflection of kind of organically what's coming out of their pipeline? Is it a reflection of Disney\u2019s strategic priorities? And has there been any change in kind of how Pixar is thinking about their production process?\nRobert Iger: Well, first of all, we're increasing capacity at Pixar. In fact, we're building a new structure there as we speak. And the goal all along was to essentially ramp up output, but do so very carefully. I can't speak for where Pixar was before the acquisition, but since the acquisition, and we've talked about a blend of both original movies and movies and sequels or movies derived from movies that have already been made. We are not forcing sequels though into the system unless we've got directors and storytellers that have good ideas for those sequels. Because we feel that we\u2019ll do more damage either to the franchise or to our business if we just put sequels out there for the sake of making sequels. I think you'll see when Toy Story 3 comes out exactly what we mean. We had a director and a group of storytellers that had a great story to tell and a real passion for telling it. And therefore, we put it into production. The same thing is true with Cars 2 and the same thing with Monsters. We didn't mandate a sequel to any of those. We just obviously said that we're open to it and certainly encouraged it but only when there was a good idea. So other than the fact that there is a slight ramp up in capacity, there's been real no change in philosophy since the acquisition was announced. And again, your blend over the next certainly five years of sequels and original films.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield with BTIG.\nRichard Greenfield - Pali Capital: Jay, I think you said that Theme Parks went from down 10% on the last call tracking to actually down six. But I thought you said at the beginning that the actually domestic in total is down four. So I just want to make sure the spread was 10 to four between last call and this call and then I was curious in your comment about 10% looking forward, what counts as Easter, losing an Easter week versus last year? How much does that impact that down 10? And then just a quick housekeeping question, there\u2019s a note in the release about zone finance packaging ending early and a tax charge, just wondering if those are actually excluded in the $0.48 or whether that's an additional add-back that we should be making an adjustment for?\nJames Rasulo: Let me start with your first question on the Theme Park numbers. So the 10% to 6% was rooms on the books in the second quarter at the time of our earning call and rooms on the books finally when we got there. The 4% had to do with attendance. So those are clearly apples and oranges. They are related, but there\u2019s no spread between those numbers. They're different numbers. Is that clear? And in terms of your second question, the buyout of the film financing is an interest issue, and it's about $20 million round numbers. That'll be down in Q2.\nRichard Greenfield - Pali Capital: And then how much of Theme Parks was due to the switch in the calendar year related to holidays in terms of the 10% going forward?\nJames Rasulo: Last quarter, I told you that the week that we lost was about $60 million to us and the week that we gained is 20, so I'll let you work it from there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi with Standard & Poor's Equity Group.\nTuna Amobi - S&P Equity Research: In Disney XD branding, if you can perhaps provide some more color on the timing of some of those programming blocks that Bob alluded to? And over time where do you see the upside from this channel, how you\u2019re kind of positioned in it for this upfront? Do you see mostly advertising affiliate upside? How do you think that kind of shakes out over time? And separately, with regard to Alice, Bob, I was wondering how the performance of this film has kind of shaped your overall 3D philosophy? Kind of specifically, any title that you\u2019ve already announced in the near term that you might actually be producing in 3D? And any comment as well on the DVD strategy for Alice would be helpful in terms of the timing, Blu-ray, et cetera. That would be helpful.\nRobert Iger: First of all, 3D. I\u2019ve almost lost track of what we announced is in 3D and what isn't. But you can assume that there\u2019s a lot under consideration. What we've announced is Toy Story 3, which is just coming up; Step Up, which is a Touchstone film; Tangled, which is a re-titled Rapunzel; Tron, the end of the year; Mars Needs Moms and Cars 2 will all be in 3D. We\u2019ve not made announcements about other future live-action films, but we're in discussions on a number of them. Our overall feeling about 3D is that it\u2019s obviously a valuable technology both to the movie industry and for the viewer. It's one that we\u2019ve taken advantage of for a long time, and one that we really believe in. But we don't believe every film should be in 3D. And when applied, we think 3D should be applied well and not done in a last-minute sort of paste-it-on kind of approach. Because we think that if, one, we make films in 3D that don't really benefit from them being in 3D, that's not necessarily good. And if 3D is used badly either by us or the industry, that\u2019s not good. We obviously have something good going here particularly when you look at the premium that the industry is getting from ticket price perspective, and if we go to the well too often or in the wrong ways, we're going to kill the goose that laid the golden egg. On the Alice front, we're very excited about the film overall and about its prospects in home video. As you know, we worked out arrangements on a global basis to bring this into the marketplace some 12 to 13 weeks after release. So that enables us to put the DVD out on June 1, instead of having to either wait \u2019til the middle of the summer, which wouldn't have been optimal, or to put it out when the market in effect recovers after the summer. That would have been in September, when we felt it would have been old. So we now go into the marketplace, one, at a good time to sell DVDs, the first week in June; two, with a title that feels very, very fresh. And we think that, that bodes really well for this title. And we know that this was kind of a hard-fought victory of sorts, but it's one that I think the industry will benefit from significantly, and obviously we\u2019ll benefit from that.  Lastly, Disney XD. We rebranded channel in the U.S. It was called Jetix. And we're in the process of rebranding a number of channels globally that were either Jetix channels or the former Fox Kids channel that we bought way back with the Fox Family acquisition. So far, the programming results, meaning the effect on ratings, have been quite good for the overall channel. And we feel that, that not only bodes well for advertising, but it bodes well for our ability to increase rates down the road with a channel that's just viewed as more viable and more attractive to distributors and to consumers. The only programming that I mentioned in the call was that we are working to create a Marvel block of programming on this channel. We are already licensing Marvel product for the channel and we're stepping up that activity both as a means of growing ratings for the channel, and thus growing advertising and distribution, but also as a means of helping to use the channel to strengthen the Marvel brand and to put a real spotlight on it.\nTuna Amobi - S&P Equity Research: Jay, on the Miramax charges, at $71 million? Is that just about all the charges that are expected there? Or is anything else that's on the radar for the rest of this fiscal year?\nJames Rasulo: I don't think we've laid out anything on the Miramax charges.\nTuna Amobi - S&P Equity Research: Well this $71 million was presumably all for Miramax. Am I correct?\nJames Rasulo: That's not a Miramax charge. It is the closure of the IMD production facility and a few other things.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.\nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Two questions, one\u2019s on ad trends and the second on ESPN 360. So on ad trends, if I listen what you\u2019ve said, you said scatter was 35% over the upfront but is now pacing 30% in the third quarter and then stations were up 20% and now pacing double-digit. Is that reflective of a slowdown in the ad market? Or more that the March quarter was the bottom and kind of -- so the comparisons get more difficult and then\u2026\nRobert Iger: Let me answer your first question. Those are two different things. The first measure is a price measure. It\u2019s percentage of the price, the CPMs, over what was sold in the upfronts. Those are the larger numbers that you mention. The other numbers are ad pacings or ad sales. Okay, so those are revenue numbers. So that's the difference there.\nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: I wasn't comparing them. I'm just saying so in this quarter I think you said your stations were up 20%, correct? In revenue?\nJames Rasulo: Yes.\nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Right, and you said the pacings are double-digit?\nJames Rasulo: Yes. We're using double-digit. We\u2019re not being specific about the numbers there. We're going to leave it there as it\u2019s prospective.\nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: And then on ESPN 360, I mean, we've read about pretty high consumer comments on this and a lot of demand. Can you talk about when you think we might see this more widely deployed and perhaps has this come up in the Time Warner renewal?\nRobert Iger: Well, we've grown the ESPN 3 -- we\u2019ve now rebranded it ESPN 3 -- we've grown it very nicely. In fact, we\u2019re now up above 52 million subscribers and it's a dual revenue-stream business for us. We're getting subscription fees and we\u2019re selling advertising. And we feel very good about its prospects. So we're continuing to work on the rollout. I don't want to comment about any aspect of the Time Warner negotiation. But wherever we can, whether we're in negotiation for an omnibus deal or we're in separate negotiations just to increase ESPN 3, we're working to basically grow it because we think it's a good service and a good business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Miller with Caris & Company.\nDavid Miller - Caris & Company: Jay, I'm actually kind of surprised to hear you talk about fuel costs at the Cruise Line. I was under the impression that you guys had a fuel hedge on the Cruise Line. So if you can set the record straight on that, that\u2019d be great. And then Bob, just given the global success I should say instant global success of Iron Man 2, what is your taste, if any, for perhaps buying Viacom out of the distribution arrangement that they will, I guess, enjoy for the next four Marvel films?\nJames Rasulo: Quite simply on the fuel cost, we were hedged in the prior-year second quarter. We are not hedged in the current year second quarter. But we've experienced a relatively modest, but it was the primary driver of change for the Disney Cruise Line: increasing costs.\nRobert Iger: And I have really no real comment on the second question, Dave. I mentioned in my remarks that it's our intention to distribute Marvel's films once the Paramount deal is fulfilled, and can't make any other further comment on that.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of David Bank with RBC.\nDavid Bank - RBC Capital Markets Corporation: Let me ask one question that -- a question I think you've been asked about four or five times before. I'm going to try to take one last pass at it, which is the operating leverage at ESPN was sort of materially below what we've typically seen. I think you guys did a good job of explaining what the costs were in the quarter. They were soccer, NBA and basketball stuff. But can you help us put some perspective on what the normalized margins are, even for the balance of the year? Like was there a mismatch in delivery of programming versus revenue? Or is this kind of a sustainable operating leverage for the next couple of quarters?\nRobert Iger: First of all, you have lower margins in the early quarters because as we've explained, we have revenue recognition issues as it relates to program covenants that we have with the distributors and the rates that they pay us for ESPN. And Jay, in fact, talked about how some of that revenue is going to move from the fourth quarter to the third when you compare those quarters to last year. So operating leverage actually improves as we recognize more revenue as we fulfill the program covenants. I think ESPN is a business that's kind of difficult to compare on a quarter-to-quarter basis because first of all, there are timing issues that are at stake in terms what Jay talked about ball games shifting out of a quarter, sometimes they\u2019re apples to oranges comparisons just in terms of how far certain series go, whether they go four games or whether they go seven games. You'll see some fluctuation there, particularly in the basketball season. What we say about ESPN, which is pretty clear, is that we continue to grow its subscription revenues and we\u2019re entering into some negotiations that are critical in that regard and that ad pacings at ESPN have generally been quite strong. And in fact, they feel extremely bullish about their upfront that's coming up. They\u2019ve seen extraordinary growth in a robust marketplace with automotives and consumer electronics and men's grooming products, and they feel really good about that product. They're continuing to invest in their digital platforms and, to some extent, internationally, so there are costs associated with that this last quarter. And by the way, on the digital front, their digital revenue was up 30% over where it was a year ago, which is pretty remarkable. And they're getting real demand for things like iPad apps and for homepages in the ESPN.com world. So I think again, we don\u2019t really look at ESPN on a quarter-to-quarter basis. It's just not how we manage it. Particularly given all the timing issues and the fact that there are a variety of different ins and outs in terms of how revenue is recognized, how sports events are scheduled, and their outcome.\nJames Rasulo: Two quick things I'd like to add to that. First of all, I've said again, in Europe we're in ramp-up. A lot of the costs we talked about are related to that. So there's some deleverage when you're in ramp-up in building a business. Secondly, I want to clarify something that's out there relative to ad sales. What we report is basically revenue. And revenue includes both what a lot of other people report, which is cash sales and also whatever made good there are in the course of the quarter or the year. So sometimes, some of the numbers we see out there, and you guys and ladies see out there, are not apples-to-apples across different companies.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alan Gould with Soleil Securities.\nAlan Gould - Soleil Securities Group, Inc.: In terms of the ESPN affiliate fees going forward, can you give us some sense as to how much is contractually built in over the next few years versus how much we may see some variance, some upside of contracts get renegotiated?\nJames Rasulo: We haven't and won't disclose when all of our carrier agreements expire. Obviously, they all, at some point over the next years, have expiration. And at that time, they get renegotiated and we can't give you too much guidance on what the trajectory is and of course, what's going to happen when we sit down and renegotiate those.\nAlan Gould - Soleil Securities Group, Inc.: Jay, could you possibly give us what percentage get renegotiated next three years or so?\nJames Rasulo: I can't.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Janedis with Wells Fargo Securities.\nJohn Janedis - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Jay, you touched a bit on to this, but can you expand more on how the weakening in the euro has impacted bookings during the fiscal third quarter and to what extent the fluctuation impacts the class of hotel and spending at the domestic parks from European visitors?\nJames Rasulo: I will tell you this that international attendance was not a major driver for Parks and Resorts in terms of movement in Q2 of this year. And historically, we haven't found, as I mentioned, changes in exchange rates to be a huge driver over long periods of time. It really is more related to the economic strength of the origin countries than anything else. In this past quarter, Walt Disney World saw relatively flat international attendance. Disneyland's international attendance was up but it wasn't from currency fluctuation countries. So I really don't think that, that is something you can look to for a driver for this quarter. I didn't catch the second half of your question, I'm sorry.\nJohn Janedis - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Does the exchange rate at all impact the maybe the class of hotel or the spend once the visitors get to the parks?\nJames Rasulo: Typically, it doesn't but I will also hasten to add that at Walt Disney World where we see most of our European attendance, many of the folks stay off property. So they stay in the vast number of vacation homes in Orlando. They usually stay for a two-week period of time, two week plus so we wouldn't probably pick that up at our resort, anyway, even if there was an impact. But I don't think there is, to be honest with you.\nJohn Janedis - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Is it fair to say that the current discount at Walt Disney World is maybe in the 20% to 30% range versus two years ago?\nJames Rasulo: Well I mentioned on our last call and I'll repeat it. A year ago, we had our entire property on a promotional program that was basically buy four nights and get three free. This current year, we did a tiered program where only the deluxe hotels were buy four, get three free and the rest of the property was buy five, get three free. So we lowered the discount. I'll let you do the arithmetic on what four plus three and five plus three look like in terms of percentages, but the numbers you throw out are relatively high compared to what we're looking at right now.\nOperator: You're final question comes from the line of Tony Wible with Janney.\nTony Wible - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: I was hoping you can comment on your willingness to push ahead with ESPN 3D. If we start to see more CE companies pushing these chipsets that do 2D to 3D conversion. And also in that same main, do you anticipate the leagues, at some point, fragmenting out the 3D rights apart from the 2D rights?\nRobert Iger: We're in development with using 3D technology for ESPN, like we announced a deal with Sony some months ago to help jumpstart that. And in fact, the World Cup is going to be offered in 3D. There are a lot of issues that are related to this. Obviously, you're looking at a world where there are very few 3D sets out there and the ability to transmit still has some limitations, although it can be done. And so we think that as is the case with any technology that makes the experience better that it's worth spending money to develop and ultimately will create value. But this is slow going. And we're just looking at the beginning. I don't anticipate sports rights being broken out, 3D versus 2D, and certainly something that we wouldn't tolerate. If anything, it's possible that 3D channels will be offered to consumers on a separate or an add-on basis. But I don't anticipate rights being sold to us that are essentially segregated between 2D and 3D.\nLowell Singer: Thanks again, everyone, for joining us today.

Welcome to the Q1 2010 Walt Disney Earnings Conference Call. My name is Diana and I will be your operator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\nLowell Singer: Hey, thanks and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the Walt Disney Company's First Quarter 2010 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued a few minutes ago. It\u2019s now available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today\u2019s call is being webcast and that webcast will also be available on our website. Following the call we will post a transcript of today's call and a replay to our website. Joining me in Burbank for today\u2019s call are Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer and Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob is going to lead, followed by Jay and then we will of course be happy to take your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob and we'll get started.\nBob Iger:  Thank you, Lowell and good afternoon. We're pleased with our first quarter performance which was better than last years due in part to improved advertising and affiliate revenue in our immediate networks and better attendance in our Parks and Resorts. At this point we have limited visibility regarding the economy and its impact on our businesses and thus we will continue to focus on controlling costs by creating great content and experiences and building our brands. We are also maintaining our focus on long term growth strategies in a world of rapid technological change and evolving consumer behavior. Our movie studio under its new leadership is focused on proving its creative performance through high quality branded films Disney, Pixar and Marvel. The studio has also restructured its organization to produce, market and distribute movies more efficiently in light of the challenges the movie business is facing. This will help reduce costs and better position the studio with regard to the timing, pricing and distribution of its films. Through our long term commitment for 3-D, we and others in the film industry have proved that a better experience can draw more people to the theatre and increase box office. We're excited about our upcoming live action slate including Alice in Wonderland, Prince of Persia, Sorcerer\u2019s Apprentice and Iron Man 2, the first Marvel film to be released since we completed our acquisition. Tron, our December live action release is looking very promising and we're about to start production Pirates 4 which will be released in May of 2011. On the animation side we're thrilled with Toy story 3 which is not only a terrific film from a creative perspective but represents the essence of our franchise strategy. With a great new story filled with beloved characters, this highly anticipated film has been embraced by the creative teams across Disney who will develop new merchandise, video games and experiences at our parks and resorts. The second installment of Cars, another strong franchise for the company will hit theaters in the summer of 2011. And speaking of great Pixar animation, I would like to congratulate Pete Doctor and the team that created Up, which last week received five Oscar nominations including best picture and best animated picture. I also would like to congratulate the animation team at Disney behind The Princess and the Frog which also received the best animated picture nomination as well as two others. We wish them all our best for March 7th when the Academy Awards air on ABC. Our media networks, we have been pleased with the success of our Wednesday Night ABC comedy block of the middle, modern family and Cougar Town and the strength shown by such returning dramas as Grey's Anatomy. Castle and particularly LOST which delivered terrific ratings in its final season premier last week. We're also benefiting from the growing international strength of Disney Channel and the record ratings performance of ESPN. It's clear that ESPN's investment in programming and production values is delivering great results while their innovative use of new technology platforms is allowing them to serve fans in new ways to reach more people and to build their brand worldwide. At Parks and Resorts we've continued to invest in enhancing the guest experience as well as increasing our scope of attractions and destinations. Over the last few weeks, we have started work on significant expansion projects at Hong Kong Disney Land and the Magic Kingdom at Disney World. Construction is also well underway at our Aulani Resort at Hawaii which will open late next year. This summer our expansion and improvement of California venture begins to roll out with a magnificent new experience world of color, while next January the Disney Dream, the first of our two new crew ships will set sail on its maiden voyage. Its now five weeks since we closed the Marvel deal and there is a great deal of enthusiasm and a lot of work going on to pursue opportunities in the content, development and licensing businesses worldwide. The prospect of growing the Marvel brand and expanding the presence of its characters and stories on our media platform and our Disney stores and through our worldwide retail presence is really exciting. In closing we believe our consistent strategic focus, our innovative use of technology and a growing range of high quality branded content puts us in a good competitive position to deliver long term growth. And now I would like to introduce our new CFO Jay Rasulo. Jay has done a fantastic job for us at Park and Resorts and has been with the Company since the 80s. He is committed to our focus on return on invested capital, strong free cash flow, improving economic profit and growing the Company. I think you are all going to really enjoy getting to know him in the coming months and here he is Jay Rasulo.\nJay Rasulo: Thanks Bob and good afternoon everyone. I'm excited to be here. In my comments this afternoon I'm going to address three important topics. First, the drivers of our Q1 results. Second, some of the key swing factors that will influence our performance for the remainder of the year and last, though visibility remains limited across our businesses, I'm going to talk a little bit about the trends that we're currently seeing in the marketplace. I will begin with studio entertainment. Operating income improved over the prior year driven by domestic home entertainment. Lower marketing, distribution and packaging costs in addition to decreased amortization expense were the main reasons for this improvement. Results in the quarter were reduced somewhat by higher film write downs and lower music album sales compared to the prior year. Bob talked about our important upcoming theatrical releases. I am sure it\u2019s obvious that the performance of these films will be a key swing factor in our full year financial results. At our media networks higher affiliate revenue at Disney Channel worldwide contributed to increased profits for the segment additionally ESPN delivered higher affiliate and advertising revenue in Q1 which more than offset increases in programming cost due to college football, premier league football in the UK and NFL. Ad revenues for ESPN came in mid single digit percentage points above the prior year Q1 notably ESPN enjoyed record ratings in Q1 up over 7% from prior year driven by Monday night football and college football.  We recorded lower income in Q1 from our equity networks due to higher programming expenses in addition to restructuring costs. Broadcasting operating income was higher compared to prior year largely as a result of the bad debt expense associated with the Tribune bankruptcy filing that was incurred in last years first quarter.  ABC studios enjoyed higher revenue from sales of its shows particularly Criminal Minds. ABC network advertising revenue excluding sports declined in the quarter due to lower prime time ratings and the lower average pricing even as scatter CPM came in more than 20% above up front levels, advertising at our TV stations was 5% lower than last quarter when they were strong political ad sales. So far in Q2 scatter pricing for ABC network is running almost 30% above upfront levels. Ad sale pricings at ESPN are up mid single digits from prior year however advertisers continue to make their purchases very close to air dates limiting our ability to read longer term trends.  Our interactive media segment reported lower revenue because we released fewer video game titles in the quarter. Operating losses were trimmed through lower marketing and other costs at Disney interactive studios. At Disney online Club Penguins saw strong growth in paid subscription contributing to better results. At consumer products lower licensing revenue impacted our results. Earned revenue decreased by 18% compared to prior Q1 when we benefited from strong sale of Hannah Montana and High School Musical merchandise. For the remainder of the year results at both interactive media and consumer product segment will be heavily influenced by the success of their respective initiatives tied to the theatrical release of Toy Story 3. At parks and resorts domestic attendance came in 9% higher then prior years these result benefited from the calendar shift of the new years holiday into Q1 this year in the second quarter of the prior year. We estimate that without this shift combined domestic attendance was up approximately 4% with Disneyland up 15% and Walt Disney world down by 1%.  Segment operating income came in 2% below prior Q1 as higher result that our domestic operations did not fully offset lower results at Disneyland Paris. Performance of Disneyland Paris decreased due to lower attendance and hotel occupancy.  Domestically our promotional activity helped to maintain high levels of attendance during the quarters but contributed to lower average guest spending and ticket pricing. Per capita guest spending decreased by 4%, occupancy in Orlando came in 4% lower than the prior year at 81%, while occupancy in Anaheim 7% at 78%.  Average room spending at our hotels was up slightly with strength at Walt Disney world resorts offsetting a decrease at our hotels at Disneyland. The cost at our domestic operations improved over the first quarter when our results were impacted by a roughly $40 million in mark-to-market adjustment for fuel hedges.  Cost also benefited from the lower volume driven expense as well as productivity savings. Together these factors help to offset higher pension, post retirement medical and labor inflation cost. More broadly consumers remain tentative. Room reservations for Q2 are currently running 10% behind last year. Well, guests continue to book their vacations closer to their anticipated travel dates.  There are several other swing factors that I would like to mention. I will remind you that we expect our pension and post retirement medical expenses to increase by approximately $270 million this fiscal year over last year's level. Roughly half of this increase hits the Parks and Resorts segment. It\u2019s also worth noting that our fiscal calendar makes quarterly year-over-year comparisons difficult.  Let me go through the changes, unlike last year Q2 results will not include the New Year's holiday which fell in Q1 this fiscal year. Q2 will include one week of the two week Easter holiday. Both weeks of which fell in Q3 last year. Additionally, results in fiscal 2009 benefited from 53 week where as our fiscal 2010 calendar has only 52 weeks. During Q1, we purchased only a moderate number of shares given the constraints imposed by our then ending acquisition of Marvel.  We intend to buy back the shares we issued for the acquisition by the end of fiscal 2010 and we expect the deal to be dilutive to our reported EPS by mid single digit percentages in fiscal 2010.  While we are pleased with our Q1 results I would again caution that both advertisers and consumers are making their buying decisions at the last minute. And we expect the operating environment to remain challenging in the coming quarters. We\u2019ve maintained financial discipline since the economic downturn began.  We plan to continue that focus going forward. At the same time we will build our business for the future by investing in high quality bred content and experiences that we believe will allow us to drive long term growth and value for our shareholders. With that I will turn the call back to Lowell for Q&A.\nLowell Singer: Thanks Jay. Operator we are ready to take our first question.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions). We have a question from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nBen Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Jay just following up on your comments on ESPN, could you, you didn\u2019t mention any deferrals in the quarter just wanted to check and see if there were any meaningfully positive or negative year on year on the affiliate side, and then on the parks you took a lot of action last year in terms of head count and rationalizing the cost structure some of that seems to flow through this quarter I am wondering if you could help size that up for us we think about 2010 versus 2009 and then just a bigger picture question, Bob if you could talk about how you are thinking about ESPN as you start to enter in some renegotiations on affiliate fees. I think from talking with investors a lot of the concerns around Disney as a stock and ESPN as a business is whether there is significant upside to the affiliate fees you're currently generating in the U.S. Can you talk philosophically about how you think about approaching those negotiations and positioning the business as you look for potential increases on the fee front? Thank you.\nJay Rasulo:  Let me start with your first question about deferrals at ESPN. There is nothing material in the first quarter that we need to talk about. Relative to parks costs, I talked about some specifics, the mark-to-market on fuel hedge from last year is about $40 million of the savings and then there is the group of savings that are simply related to the volume declines, particularly Walt Disney World where I mentioned a 1% volume decline and of course there are direct costs that go directly with those. Coming to the last part of your question about pulling forward the cost savings from 2009, so far the team has done an excellent job at pulling those savings forward. So you know we took a restructuring charge last year and we talked about the reduction in head count that we did and so far those costs seem to be well managed and continue to carry us forward for this year.\nBob Iger: On the ESPN front Ben we're not engaged in what I call a major active negotiation right now and as you would expect, I wouldn\u2019t attempt to in anyway predict certainty publicly where future negotiations may go. I will say that as evidenced by the fantastic ratings performance of ESPN in the quarter that we just announced, clearly our investment in its programming and its brand are paying off and with that we're delivering more value to advertisers and more value to distributors while the consumer is clearly paying heed as is evidenced by the great ratings. So we think that our position with ESPN going into a new round of negotiations is actually quite solid because of the value that we're generating. I also want to point out that the distributors do quite well with ESPN not just because of the overall value that we deliver but the ad that they sell on a local basis are worth a considerable amount to the local to the individual distributors and ESPN generates more advertising revenue then any other channel in the cable universe.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Michael Nathanson, Alliance Bernstein. Please proceed.\nMichael Nathanson - Alliance Bernstein: I have one for Jay. It was about, Jay, you talked about the pull forward or the change in calendar of New Years day in this quarter. Can you talk a bit about what the impacts and the profitability was by having a counter shift and is that week more profitable as people tend to probably book it without discounts. That\u2019s one. There is one for Bob.\nJay Rasulo: Yeah that is a very profitable week for us, round numbers. It's about a $60 million swing for us from that single week.\nMichael Nathanson - Alliance Bernstein: And lastly it's going to come out of the next quarter on a profit side.\nJay Rasulo: Yeah it comes down in the next quarter although I'll hasten to add that there is the add back from one week of Easter. I am sorry to say that one week of Easter is not quite as profitable as one week of Christmas. So we wont add it all back to the second quarter. In fact only a third or so get added back.\nMichael Nathanson - Alliance Bernstein: And then one for Bob. I wonder on the game side, the interactivity side, I wonder if you believe like the game opportunity now is as big as you first thought it was when you started investing in the game side and how much of the savings this quarter do you think is recurring?\nBob Iger: Well, I think that there is still a huge opportunity on the games front but I think it probably will be derived from a slightly changed strategy than the one that we began few years ago. It is pretty clear that the higher end console games are a little bit more challenged in the world where not only they are more costly to produce and market but there is just much more competition from casual games and games on platforms like the iPhone iTouch platform. We also learnt that the typical game that we set out to make which I'll call it Disney Branded game seems to perform better on the Nintendo Wii and DS platforms and on the platforms basically that are not to the high end console games. And so while we're going to continue to make games for the high end, we'll be very, very judicious in how many and which ones we choose.  We're looking forward to our Toy Story III game which will come out basically on all platforms. We're looking forward to the one that we're in development for Mickey Mouse. We're looking forward to Tron. And then we have another really, really interesting racing game that also comes out relatively soon. And so called Split Second by the way which got some fair amount of potential that, when it was first brought out at E3. But I would say that our focus is going to be little bit more diverse and a little bit less reliant on highest end console games. We will still maintain a similar mix of roughly 80% that would be Disney branded. I want to also mention by the way we have some interesting opportunities with Marvel and that would be a brand that we think would do extremely well on the higher end consoles. And at the same time that we're looking to be a little bit more judicious in that area. We are looking to step up our efforts on the casual games front and on the Apple platforms including the iPad where, since this might come up later we're already talking about and in fact developing products for ABC, for Disney including a pretty cool digital books product for ESPN which would probably be an even better version of their Score Center App and also for Marvel.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Spencer Wang, Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nSpencer Wang - Credit Suisse: One for Bob and one for Jay. First for Bob. Some of your peers have been pretty aggressive in negotiating cash for returns fees, I was wondering if you could just speak philosophically about how aggressive you would be trying to get cash for re trends and then for Jay just a housekeeping question. Did the $66 million in restructuring charges include the restructuring at the minority owned channels like Amy and Lifetime?\nBob Iger: Well, as you know Spencer, we run some of the best stations in the country. They are market leaders in the markets that they are operated in and we think that its time to recognize the value that they provide to distributors and their importance to local communities as well as their importance to our viewers in those communities. And so we believe that it would be appropriate for us to seek cash for retransmission consent and we believe that the same would be the case for our affiliates. I won\u2019t say how much and I won\u2019t describe any discussions we are having with the distribution community but clearly there\u2019s a trend that we're observing that we fully intend to participate in.\nJay Rasulo: I appreciate the confusion, as I did use the restructuring charges relative to that you need but those are not included in the global line restructuring cost very up in the expensive side.\nSpencer Wang - Credit Suisse: And how big were they Jay\nJay Rasulo: They weren\u2019t material they were on the order of $10 million.\nOperator: We have a question from Imran Khan, JPMorgan please proceed\nImran Khan - JPMorgan: One question is on cable and another question is on studio, on cable can you please give us some idea how much in the quarter you expensed for UK soccer right and how much for marketing for the new channel launch in the international market and how should we think about the cost going forward, and on the film side you are making changes at the film studio, what areas of the film operations do you think you need to most change now and how long do you think it will take to see some of the benefits from that? Thank you.\nBob Iger: I will answer the second part of the question, and let Jay address the first part on the film side. We have restructured virtually all areas of our studio business expect for animation which we had restructured when we acquired PIXAR back in 2006, I would say that the primary, we restructured all areas but if you look at one that I would consider the most important it would be on the creative front and that starts really with the change that was made at the top Rich Ross because the number one priority of the studio is to improve the quality of their output and I would say that you really wont see real results of that until 2011 although I will say that Rich is applying his considerable creative talent to making sure that the films that inherited that were not finished are finished to a level in a quality level that is that we are really excited about and we are in fact quite excited about the films that are coming up Alice in Wonderland, which is our March title Toy story 3 of course this summer, Prince of Persia, Sorcerer\u2019s Apprentice and Tron.  On the other side of the reorganization we have also consolidated a fair amount in terms of our approach to distributing and marketing our product we had separate groups that were doing those things for theatrical window and then for the home video window and we thought that it would be really wise and everything really just kind of related that we put them together and then doing so we believe not only will that enable us to save cost but we think we will operate it much more effectively in the market place. Relative to ESPN and the UK premier league this is a business adventure that\u2019s very much in the startup and although the increase programming course were a driver I don\u2019t think its useful to go into the details of what the additional programming cost were there.\nOperator:  We have a question from the line of Doug Mitchelson, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nDoug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank:  Thanks very much good afternoon so Bob a clarification and a question. Clarification on ABC retransmission negotiations are you prepared to pull your broadcast signal if needed I know you hope that\u2019s not the outcome but to get a fair value for the ABC network and the reason I ask is do your focus on brand and the impact a publicity battle can have on brand perception thus you are resolved to see negotiations sort of through to bitter end so to speak and then you know separately be I am always interested to hear your update on evolving digital business models since your iPad comments are interesting you said ABC content is this I guess if you can give us more details on what you think ABC might be offering on the iPad and is this a step in the direction of retailing or wholesaling your cable and broadcast now its online that would be helpful. Thanks.\nBob Iger: Two easy ones. On the retrans front we are pretty resolute because we know the value of these stations and the importance of these stations in their local markets and we know that there are stations some cases our affiliates who have been compensated for retransmission consent and we feel that we should be compensated as well, it clearly would not be our preference to see that our signal is taking down.  And we will do whatever we possibly can through negotiation to avoid that. But we also believe that we have obligation to derive value from the great investment that we make in these programs whether they are local in nature or whether they are a national in nature. We have every intension of doing just that. On the digital front, clearly it\u2019s still evolving although I took note that our digital revenues as a company had nicely exceeded $2 billion in 2009.  Some of that is commerce and some of that just comes from the distribution of our film and entertainment. We find that iPad has a lot of potential, we think it\u2019s a really compelling device. We think it could be a game changer in terms of enabling us to create essentially new forms of content. Obviously it will be a great device to play games on and to watch videos because of the clarity of the screen. But the interactivity that it will allow on a portable device with such a high quality screen is going to enable us to really start developing products that is different than the product that you typically see on an internet connected computer or on a television set.  And digital reader that we are talking about we\u2019ve put in a marketplace a digibooks product through our Disney publishing group just recently. We haven\u2019t really marketed in earnest because while its not really in beta we are still working through some of the issues that you deal with when you are launching new product like that and we were developing it primarily for the computer screen and we started developing it for the iTunes I should say for the iPhone, iTouch platform and suddenly this device comes along and provides us with an even more robust technological platform that makes the interactivity that we are going to provide things like read along simple animation music to just sort of come to life.  And that\u2019s just one example, when you think about ABC you think about a program like Lost and not just being able to watch the program but all the other things that viewers like to do with that program, ABC News another great example. ESPN Score Center which is a great App on the iPhone and provides relatively rudimentary information scores basically suddenly we have an opportunity with a platform we can really make the scores come to life.  So we are thinking about it in those terms and we think that digital media while clearly if significant is still evolving and saying its still the beginning of the beginning and that\u2019s how we look at it.\nOperator: The next question from the line of Jessica Reif-Cohen with Banc of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.\nJessica Reif-Cohen - Banc of America Merrill Lynch: I have a couple of questions, one on the theme parks it looks like hotel discounting is coming down to the 30% to 40% range versus may be 40% to 45% a year ago. So I was just hoping you could give us your current thoughts on what do you need to do to bring consumers in and are you planning to just gradually decrease the amount of discounting and then on retail, I think it just came across like a day or so that your buying your Japanese stores. Is this a country specific strategy or is it more of a global trend and then finally, Jay you mentioned the pacing's of the network and ESPN but you didn\u2019t mention anything about the TV stations?\nBob Iger: Let me start with your question theme parks. I don\u2019t think that the discounting ever got off as high as what you mentioned, 45%. I think it never in my recollection got above the 30's. But in a way, you could already see this year it's both reflected in the numbers as well as in what is offered in the market. About half of the room inventory of Walt Disney World, we went from a four plus three, buy four and get three free to buy five and get two free and we also reduced the free dining option for value rooms. And at Disneyland we saw a similar decrease in gift cards and what not. So they are clearly starting to moderate discounts already but I will tell you that its not crystal clear looking forward what the best tactics will be to eventually make our way out of discounting which I think is not only probable, impossible but we will see in the coming quarters. So we look at every quarter as we can and gauge response from consumers and act accordingly. So yes it probably won't be flipping the switch off. It will be gradual build up out of it. I wanted to talk to the station pacing. I mentioned ESPN was plus 5% and the TV stations are nearly double that. So they are pacing well also in prime time and lastly the Disney stores\u2026.\nJay Rasulo: On the Disney Stores front, we took back the stores in the United States a year ago from Children's Place. We own our stores in Europe. We had owned our stores in Japan and we sell them to Oriental Land Company which is the owner of Tokyo Disney Land, Tokyo Disney Sea and they decided that it wasn\u2019t a core strategy of theirs to own those stores in Japan and we recently decided that we would take them back and that's just become official. And they're really in the trend because at this point we own now the global Disney store chain. And on that note we did speak about a new store model, a new physical store space and I\u2019d also like say in that regard that we're looking at opportunities to upgrade our locations either within malls or in different malls around the world and we're going to roll the model out conservatively probably somewhere around 10 total globally within the next year and roughly half in the U.S. and half outside the United States but only in locations that we feel represent a real upgrade from the location that we might be in that environment.\nOperator:  We have a question from the line Jason Helfstein, Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed.\nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Company: Bob can you comment on the state of the DVD business when you factor in this quarter's results and then also because of any comments on extra pieces for CapEx for this year. \nJay Rasulo:  Well, I can comment on DVD business. I don\u2019t like to look at the DVD business on a quarter-to-quarter basis because it often is an apples-to-oranges comparison given the nature of the releases. What we're generally seeing in the DVD market is continued pressure and that\u2019s due to a number of factors. Clearly the economy is one factor. Another factor is a more secular nature. There is more competition in the market place for people's time, particularly time spent on entertainment and I think that piracy at least in some markets, not necessarily just the United States but some markets internationally is also taking its toll. And so, we really feel that we need to be cautious in terms of the movie business overall because of the pressure on that very, very important window. And that\u2019s why by the way we have been in discussions about windowing with the exhibitors because we feel that its really important for us to maintain a very healthy business on the exhibition side and 3-D is definitely contributing to that and a very healthy business on the home video side which we think is actually in the interest of the theater owners. A healthy movie business is good for them. They want us investing innovation, investing in higher quality content. And so mindful of what's going on the home video side, we feel that its time on a case-by-case basis, movie-by-movie to really take a look at how we're windowing the home video products into the marketplace. Relative to your question on CapEx, broadly across the company there are not huge swings in capital expenditures other than those projects which I think you're all aware in Parks and Resorts but to rephrase them just because I love them, both the crew ships are under construction and we are moving into spending real money on those obviously as the first one has its maiden voyage in 2011. The DCA project, the California venture that Bob has talked about in the past is in full swing and the Resort in Hawaii is beginning. Actually I think it gets topped off in April. So pretty much in full swing as well. So those projects will affect not only this year but next year as well. Next year happens to be 40% of the total spending on our two crew ships which will occur in 2011 and a significant piece of DCA. So those are projects that we feel have great rates to return and will build shareholder value and that\u2019s where you see most of the swing in capital expenditures.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Anthony DiClemente, Barclays Capital. Please proceed.\nAnthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital: One for Jay and then one for Bob. Jay just wondering what were the share buybacks in the current quarter, in the last five weeks. And then I caught the plus 5% on ESPN pacing's but I was wondering what ESPN advertising was year-over-year in the reported quarter. Then I have one for Bob.\nJay Rasulo: On your first question, relative to share buybacks, the share buybacks were very minimal in Q1 mostly because we were brought out due to the then pending Marvel acquisition. So we did not make significant purchases but I will simply repeat what I said in the comments that we do intend by the end of the fiscal year to buy back the 58.5 million shares that we issued as part of the marble transaction.\nAnthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital: I know, but what about in the last in the current quarter and not the first quarter, in the last 5 weeks can you help us about it?\nJay Rasulo: I don\u2019t think I will make that obvious but as I said we are going to be on phase 2 buy back by the end of the fiscal year.\nAnthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital: How was ESPN advertising in the first quarter?\nJay Rasulo: ESPN advertising in the second quarter was as I mentioned up single digits.\nAnthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital: In the first quarter was up single digit and its pacing up 5?\nJay Rasulo: Yeah first quarter.\nAnthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital: And then Bob I was just wondering which one of your partners one of your partners in A&E television network your equity cable network with one of your partners being acquired just wondering what your strategy is for that group of cable networks how core are those to immediate network strategy?\nBob Iger: Well a number of months ago with our partners NBC Universal and Hearst we consolidated operations to A&E history and lifetime because we felt that it was better position those assets in the market place. Those have been great investments for us and we look forward to many years of solid returns from those business returns that should be improved by the fact that we put the units together in terms of core assets they are core in the sense that we really believe in cable television programming and they certainly have been leaders in that space for a long time and we hope that we will continue. \nOperator:  We have a question from the line Michael Morris, UBS please proceed.\nMichael Morris - UBS:  Thank you good afternoon couple of items first on the part Jay you mentioned the room reservations are running about 10% behind last year at this point can you help just give little bit more context on that\u2019s sounds like a weak number it sound like its trending worse sequentially and but at the same time it also sounds like you said their promotions are rolling back at least modestly so can you kind of reconcile those two things what is room reservations running 10% behind last year main and is it apples to apples and then over the networks on a couple of occasions you mention that international strength of the Disney channel and I am looking for just anymore color you can give there on why is it getting sequentially stronger in terms of what you are seeing demand for the Disney channel and how much of is it really core and why now thanks.\nBob Iger: Well let me take the Disney channel side and then Jay can answer the first question about reservations on the book or trends in reservations. The Disney channel strengthened international is coming for a few directions one rolling out in new markets to continue to do two increasing our subscriber base some markets we actually is only move fairly reasonably from more of a premium service to a basic service and then we also are overall because of a number factors increasing the rates that we are getting from our Disney channels internationally also the ratings of the Disney channel domestically have been up nicely and the strength of its programming is essentially felt on a world wide basis the other thing that we have been doing quite successfully is converting our former Fox family and JetX and Toon Disney channels to Disney XD and the ratings there where we have converted have also been up nicely and those channels are largely advertiser supporter. So stronger ratings should result overtime and stronger revenue and now we are improving revenue prospects but also strengthening the brand. \nJay Rasulo: Relative to rooms on the books, I don\u2019t have and I am not going to give you sort of a crystal clear picture here but I will say that when Tom talked about our last quarter at this time, our rooms on the books for the first quarter they were down 5%, we finished the quarter down 2%, its just another indication that there is late bookings and the 10% that we are down today for me is not fully indicative of where the quarter is going to wind up, but the number speaks for itself, we are down as to what's on the book has it right now. \nMichael Morris - UBS: Okay, right. may be if I look to year-over-year do you know, its really tough I am just trying to figure out sequentially whether we are actually still in the downward part of the cycle and whether you might have to be more promotional, anything else clarify we can get there?\nJay Rasulo: The only thing that I can add to what I said was that we do the holiday week flip flop in the quarter. And that might help you think about it. \nOperator: We have a question from the line of Richard Greenfield, Pali Capital. Please proceed. \nRichard Greenfield - Pali Capital:  May be just a follow-up on that last question because the issue a year ago you all seemed very focused and Jay obviously were running parts, very focused on making sure that you maintain the tenants at the utmost level and if we use discounting as a leverage to make sure that the tenant stayed as flat as possible. I am just curious essentially why are you not being more promotional this year? I mean you clearly got that back so obviously weren\u2019t or probably were expecting without a significant rebound in the economy we are expecting some attendance to drop I am just curious you know what\u2019s changed year-over-year is it just simply that you can\u2019t discount for that long or how is just that dynamic between price and volume and your approach to it different this year than a year ago today, thanks.\nJay Rasulo: Not different as strategically not different, obviously when you run promotions in the market place you switch them, you change them out, we\u2019ve been pretty demonstrative about our desire to start to pull out of the level of discounting we were at and we are doing that. I think that Q1 I would call our volume our total volume domestically was up I would call our volume at world flat and so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s either any change in the strategy and tactics that we are using frankly there isn\u2019t any change in the results either other than the fact that Disneyland attendance was much higher for the quarter. \nBob Iger : So I think that we should notice what we do is we test the market place. So you maintain pricing meaning higher pricing to a point and if the market place doesn\u2019t respond to that and that\u2019s when you judiciously roll out your promotional strategy and some of that by the way is just a matter of timing, I am pretty confident then we are going to be able to deliver as Jay said the volume that we need over the course of this year the question is how much will we have to discount to get in and with visibility being relatively limited its difficult for us to predict exactly what that would be, our goal of course is to slowly rein our guests of discounting and because we don\u2019t believe that we are dealing with an economy right now that enables us to shut off the discounting immediately.\nOperator: We have a question from the line David Miller, Caris & Company.\nDavid Miller - Caris & Company: Just a question on Miramax, assuming you're willing to talk about it. I know you haven\u2019t made any sort of formal announcement about the sale of the library and the brand name but assuming the reports in the financial press are true why put this library up from sale now? Why not wait until the MGM library is sold? So your sort of affecting supply-demand dynamics here by putting the library up for sale at the same time as MGM. Why not wait say a year or so for both the market to improve and to create better supply-demand dynamics just by having a constriction situation on library sales? Appreciate your comments.\nBob Iger: Well you're presuming that MGM is going to be sold. I don\u2019t know what the timing of that is going to be. You probably know a lot more than we do. We\u2019ve determined that continuing to invest in new Miramax movies wasn\u2019t necessarily a poor strategy of ours and the investment and production and distribution, the only investment that remains is to cover the movies that are being made or have been made and have yet been distributed or released. And with that we believe that it would be prudent for us to explore all of our options. We're always intent on driving as much value as we possibly can from an asset and to some extent that will affect the timing of what we do next with Miramax and I don\u2019t think that getting any more details would necessarily be either wise or consistent with our approach. But the goal here for the company is to continue to focus on our core strategies and to drive as much value from all of our assets as we possible can.\nOperator:  You have a question from the line of John Janedis, Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nJohn Janedis - Wells Fargo: You referenced lower rates to both cable and broadcast. I'm just wondering, where do you think we are in the recovery in terms of demand? What needs to happen from here to see rates move higher on a year-over-year basis understanding the upfront pricing was soft and how far is sellout from historical levels?\nBob Iger: Well what needs to happen is you obviously need an economy that is stronger than the economy that we're in. We're seeing some really robust sales in certain sectors. Jay mentioned that scatter is running at ABC almost 30% above up front this quarter. That\u2019s obviously a result of some sectors strain. We're seeing for instance a lot of activity among Telco's and technology companies. On the local side we're seeing some renewed activity among autos, both domestic and foreign autos. But in general there is still a marketplace that is not as strong as certainly the market place that we saw back before the market fell apart in the later part of 2008. Was there a second part to that question?\nJohn Janedis - Wells Fargo: On the sell out, are you\u2026\nBob Iger: Yes, you asked about sell out. We at the up front sold considerably less than we had sold in the years prior. That was due to, not that much pricing pressure back then and we didn\u2019t want to sell into our inventory deeper than the prices that we were getting at the time. Interestingly enough we still have units to sell in the April, May, June period. Actually I think we still have units to sell this quarter as well, less so this quarter. We have a relatively decent mix of inventory to go. There is not that much inventory left in the prime time market place though, our information suggest that our competitors are extremely well sold. I am not going to compare how much is left to go and scatter in terms of amount of inventory but there is a still a fair amount to sell and as I said we got a good mix and with scatter pricing the way it is we feel pretty good about it.  I should also add that\u2019s scatter have been strong, earlier in the quarter they were currently in and then it slowed slightly and then we have just seen a fairly new and robust wave of spending again which is actually a good indication. But I think in general you are looking at a market place that is not as strong as it was 18 months ago.  \nJohn Janedis - Wells Fargo: Thanks and one quick follow-up I appreciate the color there. Is the Toyota issue having an impacted at all in terms of demand broadly?\nBob Iger: No I called our own stations and I spoke with our network and I spoke with ESPN over the last 24 hours and they have not seen any impact whatsoever due to the Toyota issues. \nOperator: Okay, we have a question from the line of Tony Wible, Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed. \nTony Wible - Janney Montgomery Scott: Thank you. I was hoping you can provide a little more clarity on the premium scheme you have within the DVD market I think with Up you guys were selling digital copy as well as Blu-Ray and DVD all in one skew. Just curious to see what kind of uptick you are seeing with that? Or is that something you are going to look to do for more titles going forward? \nBob Iger: Yeah, we definitely are seeing some decent premium pricing from Blu-Ray and then from a three pack which is the three Blu-Ray and the standard DOS and then another file that enables you to download the file on to a computer hard drive which is a nice product. I am not going to give percentages of sales but they are relatively decent. On the Blu-ray side and that\u2019s just another anecdote we went out in the marketplace with Snow white with the Blu-Ray and a Blu-Ray plus standard debt exclusive window for six weeks and sales of Snow White were 68% Blu-Ray which is just a huge number.  And actually Snow White we are told was the number one Blu-Ray title in calendar 2009. So clearly there\u2019s been some continued growth of Blu-Ray in the marketplace is definitely a product that consumer seem to like and we are getting the pricing premium that we hope to get and have not seen signs of that falling even in a difficult economy so we remain believers and we are going to continue to experiment with different packaging and different window and timing the market primarily because of the success of the exclusive window for Snow White.

[Operator Instructions] And now I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks, everyone. Good afternoon, and welcome to the Walt Disney Company's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued about 45 minutes ago. It is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast, and that webcast will be available on our website as will a replay and a transcript of the call. Joining me in Burbank for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob will lead off followed by Jay and then we'll be happy, of course, to take your questions.  And with that, let me turn it over to Bob, and we'll get started.\nRobert A. Iger: Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon. We're proud to report Disney posted record revenue, net income and earnings per share for the 2011 fiscal year. Our net income grew by 21% over a year ago on a 7% increase in revenue, and our earnings per share adjusted for comparability were up 23% for the year. I'm also very pleased with our fourth quarter results, which were driven by Media Networks and Parks and Resorts, with net income up 30% and revenue up 7%. Our EPS for the quarter, adjusted for comparability, grew 31% to $0.59. Our fiscal 2011 results validate our strategic priorities and demonstrate we can grow our earnings in the near term while continuing to invest for long-term shareholder value. Given the challenging economic environment this year, I'm particularly proud of our excellent management team, which has consistently delivered on our strategy, creating high-quality content, expanding our platforms and growing our iconic brands and assets worldwide. Disney's collection of strong brands is unparalleled in the media and entertainment space in the U.S. And in 2011, we made significant progress in expanding our footprint in 3 large rapidly developing markets, Russia, China and India.  Less than 2 weeks ago, we announced the launch of a free-to-air Disney Channel in Russia that will reach 40 million households and 75% of the country's viewers with signature Disney programming and original Russian content. With a portfolio of 100 Disney Channels around the world, up from 19 a decade ago, Disney Channel serves as an anchor for our growth and is a preeminent brand builder. We're extremely excited about this opportunity in Russia. In China, work has begun on Shanghai Disney Resort, a 963-acre site that will include Shanghai Disneyland, 2 themed hotels and a large retail dining and entertainment venue. The Shanghai Resort is a key component of our growth strategy in China. And in India, we are in the process of acquiring the 50% equity that we don't own in UTV, one of the country's premier media and entertainment companies. Combined with UTV, we will be the leading film studio, producing both UTV and Disney-branded films, and we'll increase the number of cable and satellite channels we own from 3 to 9. The combined UTV and Disney assets will allow us to significantly grow our businesses in India. We've made significant investments in Parks and Resorts in the last 5 years and many are coming online. Toy Story Playland just opened a great guest reaction in Paris, and we're excited about its opening in Hong Kong next week. Next year, the highly anticipated Cars Land at Disney's California Adventure and Little Mermaid at Disney World's expanded Fantasyland will be completed. Following the success of the Disney Dream earlier this year, we will launch the Disney Fantasy in Spring 2012 and our Imagineers and James Cameron are already at work on the design of our first Avatar-themed land at Walt Disney World's Animal Kingdom. Our long-term investments in Parks and Resorts are aimed at strong returns on capital as well as strengthening and growing our product in markets we already operate in and expanding our presence globally. Nothing illustrates our ability to create enduring quality family entertainment better than the rerelease of the Lion King in 3D. Nearly 20 years after its original premiere, it has grossed about $150 million in box office worldwide and was the #1 selling Blu-ray Disc its first week of release. Over the next 2 years, we will release 4 additional award-winning animated films in 3D, Beauty and the Beast, Little Mermaid, Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo, and introduce a whole new generation of families to these hallmark theatrical events. In fiscal 2011, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, the fourth film in our extremely successful franchise, earned more than $1 billion in global box office, 1 of only 10 films to have done so. And we're in early development for another Pirates sequel. Cars continues to be a great franchise for us and in addition to grossing $559 million in global box office, Cars 2 continues to drive very strong performance in our Consumer Product business. Which we expect to continue into the holiday season. It has surpassed both Star Wars and Toy Story in retail sales of movie themed merchandise. Marvel's Thor and Captain America were among the top 10 non-sequel releases of the year and we are pleased with the performance of both films and the true benefits of our Marvel acquisition should be quite visible in 2012. First, in May, Thor and Captain America will join Iron Man, The Hulk and Black Widow in Marvel's The Avengers, the first Marvel film to be marketed and distributed by Disney. The Avengers shows great promise with a record 10 million downloads on iTunes when the trailer debuted, and it is well on its way to being our next great franchise. Then in July, Sony Pictures will release The Amazing Spiderman. We're excited about the film and expect it will drive significant benefits for Spiderman consumer products.  To that end, we recently completed a transaction with Sony Pictures to simplify our relationship. And in the deal, we purchased Sony Pictures' participation in Spiderman merchandising, while at the same time, Sony Pictures purchased from us our participation in Spiderman films. This transaction will allow us to control and fully benefit from all Spiderman merchandising activity, while Sony will continue to produce and distribute Spiderman films. We won't be specific about the economics of this 2-way transaction, but we expect it will drive attractive returns for Disney. Our upcoming slate of films is rich in variety and potential. On Thanksgiving weekend, The Muppets will hit theaters in what we believe will rebuild another beloved franchise. Dreamworks' War Horse, a Steven Spielberg directed epic, will be in theaters in December. Early next year, we're looking forward to our live action adventure film, John Carter, directed by Andrew Stanton of Finding Nemo and WALL-E. And as I already mentioned, The Avengers will premiere in May. And opening in June is the highly anticipated Disney-Pixar's Brave, featuring a spirited Scottish girl on a comic medieval adventure. In November 2012, we will release Wreck-It Ralph, the Disney animation feature set in a multidimensional world of video games. Turning to Cable Net, ESPN posted a record number of viewers for the fourth consecutive year and remains the leading destination for sports. ESPN.com has captured 70% of fans on mobile sports sites, and in September, ESPN.com set a record for its most unique users ever of 52 million. ESPN was able to grow its viewership and expand its content offerings to subscribers while showing discipline and acquiring sports rights. Our recently signed long-term agreements reached for the NFL, Pac-12 and Wimbledon ensure ESPN will continue to offer the broadest array of sports coverage for fans to access wherever they watch sports. In fiscal 2011, Disney Channel and ABC Family posted record viewership for their targeted audiences. Disney Channel is now #1 across broadcast and cable, among kids and tweens for total day and prime time. Our Phineas and Ferb TV Movie is the #1 scripted telecast on broadcast and cable for that demographic and the #1 scripted cable show in total viewers. The Phineas and Ferb series and movie are also delivering record viewership internationally, and a feature film is planned for release in 2013. Phineas and Ferb is well on its way to becoming a successful franchise for the company. ABC Family had its fifth consecutive year of growth in this key demographic of 12 to 34 year-olds, up more than 9% in fiscal 2011. ABC Family was home to 3 of the top scripted shows on basic cable this summer, including Switched At Birth, which was the top-rated new cable show among millennial viewers. At ABC Primetime, we're seeing some very promising signs. ABC has 2 of the top 3 new dramas among 18 to 49 year-olds and the top 2 drama debuts with ABC owned Once Upon A Time and Revenge. Our Wednesday night block is posting its second consecutive year of double-digit percentage growth among total viewers in adults 18 to 49 with the ongoing success of Modern Family, the new strength of the middle and encouraging results from the new show, Suburgatory. ABC's new hit dramas coupled with our comedy lineup will form the foundation for rebuilt and revitalized schedule in the coming seasons. As we prepare to relaunch disney.com next fall, we're excited about the deal we recently announced to produce co-branded family-friendly video experiences for disney.com and YouTube that we believe will grow our brand presence online and drive new traffic. In our Game segment, we've diversified our strategy and are seeing success with both social and mobile games. Where's My Water? reached the top of the paid apps chart for 3 weeks this fall and Gardens of Time was recently named top online social game by its industry peers. And we'll be launching several new Disney-branded Facebook games incorporating Disney IP in 2012. Lastly, all of our Movie and TV businesses is supported by a strong global licensing group in a solid platform in the Disney stores. In addition to these businesses, consumer products is a driving publishing business domestically and internationally and is launching a number of titles for mobile devices and is creating a broad digital strategy.  This was a great year financially and strategically for the company, and we're very excited about 2012 with our upcoming film slate, momentum at ABC Primetime, continued growth at ESPN, the opening of multiple park attractions and the progress we're making to deliver profitability across our digital businesses. We're confident our strategic focus on great content, innovative uses of technology and global brand and asset growth will position us to deliver long-term shareholder value. And with that, I will turn it over to Jay Rasulo. Jay?\nJames A. Rasulo: Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our fourth quarter results topping off a very good year for the company. We reported record revenue, net income and earnings per share in fiscal 2011. I'm going to take a few minutes to discuss the fourth quarter in more detail and then highlight some specific fiscal 2012 items. In Q4, Media Networks was the largest contributor to our performance, driven by growth in operating income at Cable Networks, more specifically by growth at Worldwide Disney Channel and ESPN and an increase in equity income. Growth at the Worldwide Disney Channel was the result of increased revenue from the sale of Disney Channel programming, higher affiliate revenue and increased ad revenue internationally. At ESPN, higher affiliate and advertising revenue were partially offset by higher programming costs associated with contractual rate increases for college football and the NFL. Advertising revenue at ESPN was up 4% during the quarter but up 7% adjusting for the impact of last year's Men's World Cup. This growth is on top of a 19% increase ESPN delivered in Q4 last year. And if you look at the full year, ESPN ad revenue grew 18% in fiscal 2011, and that's following a double-digit increase in fiscal 2010. The growth in equity income resulted from an increase at A&E Lifetime due to the absence of programming write-offs incurred last year. During the quarter, ESPN signed a new long-term agreement with the NFL. This deal extends our Monday Night Football rights through the 2021 season and provides us with 500 hours of incremental programming per year, which we began airing this season. Extending our NFL partnership further strengthens our sports content portfolio, which continues to make ESPN the #1 destination for sports fans as well as cable television's most valuable network. At Broadcasting, Q4 operating income was higher as a result of lower programming write-offs as well as higher ad revenue at the ABC Television Network. At our own TV stations, ad revenue was down 11%, but excluding political advertising and the recently sold, Flint and Toledo stations, ad revenue was up low single digits. At the ABC Network, quarter-to-date scatter pricing is 25% above upfront levels. ESPN ad sales are pacing up single digits, and ABC Family ad sales are pacing up more than 10%. Given the strength of political spending last year, Q1 TV station ad sales are pacing down. Excluding political, TV station ad sales are pacing up. We are very pleased with our results at Parks and Resorts in the quarter. Operating income was up 33% as a result of higher guest spending at our domestic parks and higher passenger cruise days, partially offset by increased costs. Total segment margins for Q4 were up 220 basis points versus last year and domestic Parks and Resorts margins were up more than that. For the full year, total segment margins were up 90 basis points. For the quarter, domestic attendance was up 1% and per capita spending was up 9% on higher ticket prices, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Average per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 9%, while occupancy was down 2 percentage points to 81%. The increase in per room spending was driven by higher pricing and a reduction of promotional room nights. These results reflect our strategy of continuing to increase pricing to normal levels. So far this quarter, domestic hotel reservations are pacing in line with prior year levels, while book rates are up low single digits. I'll note from this point forward, current year domestic reservations will include Aulani hotel rooms, the impact of which is de minimis in Q1 bookings. Results at our international resorts were higher due to increased attendance and guest spending at Hong Kong Disneyland and higher guest spending at Disneyland Paris. We are also encouraged by the pace of recovery at the Tokyo Disney Resort, where our royalties from Tokyo were modestly higher this quarter compared to prior year. At Studio Entertainment, operating income was up for the quarter as a result of lower film cost write-downs and higher domestic theatrical revenues despite lower results in our International, Theatrical and Worldwide Home Video businesses. Domestic theatrical results were up in the quarter as a result of Cars 2 and the release of The Lion King 3D as well as lower prerelease marketing expense compared to last year. Although Cars 2 performed well globally in the quarter, it faced a difficult international box office comparison with the incredibly successful Toy Story 3. Home Entertainment results were down due to lower unit sales of key titles domestically and lower catalog sales internationally.  At Consumer Products, operating income was up for the quarter, driven by a higher licensing revenue due to sales of Cars merchandise and higher revenue from Marvel properties. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up 2%. At the Interactive Media segment, operating losses decreased from the prior year due to lower marketing and product development costs in our Console Game business, partially offset by lower results in our social games. Keep in mind that results -- social games reflect a full quarter of operations of Playdom compared to the prior year, which only included 1 month of operations.  I'd now like to turn to fiscal 2012 and provide some color on a few of our businesses that should help with timing and comparability issues for the coming year. In fiscal 2012, ESPN will once again air 4 BCS games and the Rose Bowl, all of which will take place during fiscal Q2. Last year, 2 of these games, the Rose and Fiesta Bowls, add during fiscal Q1. Our new ACC contract, which began in September of this year, will continue to impact comparisons in fiscal Q1 and Q2, which encompass most of the college football and basketball seasons. Our new exclusive coverage of Wimbledon will begin during the second half of the fiscal year, while our new contract with the Pac-12 conference will begin in fiscal Q4. We remain hopeful that there will be a quick resolution to the NBA situation. However, our broad portfolio of rights will enable us to effectively program ESPN without the NBA. We have plans in place to replace the majority of live NBA programming hours with coverage of other sports, including college basketball, so the absence of the NBA will not affect our ability to achieve our full year programming commitments. Since many NBA advertisers want to reach male demos, we'll expect a good portion of NBA ad dollars will be reexpressed to other ESPN properties, including college basketball. We expect any reduction in our NBA-related revenue would be more than offset by a reduction in rights costs. I'd also like to take a moment to address our affiliate contracts with multichannel operators, a subject we've been asked about many times in the past few months. We believe the strength of our cable networks and own television stations positions us well for a series of upcoming negotiations. Our recent agreements with Time Warner Cable, Verizon and Bright House Networks are long-term comprehensive and create value for both Disney and our partners. We expect these deals to serve as templates for upcoming negotiations. Given the timing in our existing contracts, we expect to negotiate new agreements for our Cable Networks and owned TV stations, covering an incremental 75% of multichannel households by the end of calendar 2014. Now let me turn to Parks and Resorts. The Disney Fantasy will launch at the very end of our fiscal Q2, and thus, the ship will not generate meaningful revenue during the second quarter. This coming summer, we will open Cars Land, the corner of our -- cornerstone of our expansion at the Disney California Adventure. These projects are part of our continued investment in growth initiatives that we expect will contribute incremental operating income once they are fully ramped up. However, we expect in fiscal 2012 our growth initiatives will contribute $500 million in both incremental revenue and expense. Having said that, we still expect Parks and Resorts margins to expand during 2012. At Interactive Media, we expect the impact of purchase accounting from the Playdom acquisition to decrease from $110 million in fiscal 2011 to approximately $50 million in fiscal 2012 with the majority recognized in the first half of the year. We expect consolidated CapEx to be approximately $500 million higher than in fiscal year '11 with our work on the Shanghai Disney Resort being the largest driver of this increase. We expect pension and postretirement medical expenses to increase by $50 million in fiscal 2012. If you recall, in May, we announced changes in our salary pension plan that will reduce our expense over the next 5 years by $350 million to $400 million or approximately $75 million per year versus our previous plan. We still expect to realize these savings in fiscal 2012. However, changes in other key assumptions, including a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate, more than offset these savings in fiscal 2012. We continue to increase the pace of our share repurchase -- continued to increase the pace of our share repurchase during the fourth quarter by buying back 58 million shares for about $2 billion, bringing our total share repurchase for fiscal year to 134.7 million shares or approximately $5 billion. During the first fiscal -- first quarter of our new fiscal year, we have repurchased 12.7 million shares for about $420 million. 2011 was a great year for our company. We delivered strong operating results, expanded operating margins, continued to invest in our core businesses and extended the reach of our brands outside of the U.S. We are very well-positioned to drive growth and returns for our shareholders in fiscal 2012 and in the years to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell for questions.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Operator, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with Nomura.\nMichael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: I have a couple. One is just housekeeping to start with. Jay, I'm just curious how is your affiliate fee growth this quarter. Can you tell us that so we don't have to wait for the K to come out?\nJames A. Rasulo: Affiliate growth in the quarter was at -- for -- so the total Cable Networks was 8%.\nMichael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Okay. And then let me ask you one on Parks and one, Bob, on Sports. On Parks, this year, they just ended -- has been really volatile on margin by quarter. I know there's been a lot going on. We talked about that in other calls, but when you look at this quarter and the factors that drove the margins this well, what were those factors? And what's kind of repeatable going forward?\nJames A. Rasulo: In terms of the Parks margins?\nMichael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Yes.\nJames A. Rasulo: I'm sorry, I missed the beginning of your question, Michael.\nMichael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Well. The question is, like, if you look at the volatility in Park margins this year, right, this was a really strong quarter. Margins and the flow-through is really high. So when you look at this quarter, what happened this quarter on margins that got you the operating leverage? And are those conditions sustainable?\nJames A. Rasulo: Yes, well, there are 2 major contributors to increased margins. Of course, when I reviewed the per caps, a lot of that was due to RNA pricing and higher ticket prices, which, needless to say, don't have a little -- a lot of interference flowing to the bottom line. We also, as we've been telling you, have been -- had a very, very strong response to our new cruise ship. It is booking at great rates. It is contributing very well to our revenue, and both of those have, I would say, were the key drivers to our margin improvement in the quarter.\nMichael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Okay. And then one for Bob on Sports. You mentioned being disciplined in buying sports rights. We've seen in the past month or 2 some pretty expensive deals for rights that maybe are not primary. So how do you balance your need to keep on acquiring key sports rights with your desire to drive returns for the company and for the shareholders? So how do you think about what you need to buy and what you don't need to buy?\nRobert A. Iger: Well, we look at each package as available individually with an eye toward literally what kind of value we think it's going to drive, whether its going to support the brand, what kind of volume are we talking about in terms of number of hours, what will the ratings be, can we convert to advertising and how can we better serve our customers, which are both the multichannel distributors, and ultimately, end-users, the viewers. The NFL is a good example. There's no question that was an expensive deal. And as I was saying, using the word discipline, I was thinking about the cost of -- to us of extending that deal. But what we saw when we did that was, first of all, long-term deal that takes us to 2021. That's tremendous certainty. We know we have certainty in terms of quality of the product and the games and the interest in those from our viewers and our distributors and advertisers, by the way. And we have the ability to program more than 500 more hours of NFL programming kind of annualized. So when we added all of that up and we looked at the growth trajectory of those rights fess, we concluded that if there's anything that creates value for ESPN, it's the NFL. And so we apply similar logic, the college football and college basketball package that we bought represent quality programming, huge local interest in those. You know if you've gone to a college that has a decent sports team how loyal you tend to be as a viewer, to that team, those teams, again, long-term deals. And the other thing that we've got gained in a lot of these deals is multi-platform capabilities. So it grows our customer engagement, and that's a big deal. The growth of ESPN.com, which I cited in my earnings comments, the use of smart mobile devices, in some cases, international rights, these are all very, very valuable. Those that we -- those sports that we did not get interestingly enough, the World Cup and the Olympics, while there's no question, they're high-quality. They don't occur every year. They occur for a short period of time. And we didn't believe that we could justify the kind of rights that ultimately others pay for it because it didn't really meet the standards based on the cost those rights were going to amount to, to us that we've adhered to for these other packages.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.\nSpencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: I just have a 2 part question on just the macroeconomic backdrop. Jay, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the booking window. Have you seen any changes there just given the macroeconomic backdrop? And if you could speak specifically to international visitation just given the volatility in the euro. And then, Bob, if you could just update us what you're seeing kind of realtime in the scatter market both for broadcast and cable, that'd be great.\nJames A. Rasulo: Okay. Let me start, Spencer. On the booking window, we -- something we watch pretty carefully, I told you 2 quarters ago that we saw a little elongation of that from 13 weeks to 14 weeks. This quarter, it remained pretty steady at about that 14 weeks between when the rooms are booked or when the vacation is booked and when the guests show up. So not a lot of movement there in this quarter. On the other question you had about international visitation, the fourth quarter happened to be a particularly strong quarter for international visitation. I have told you that for many quarters or many years. For our business as a whole, we're looking around 20% of our business, a lot of that driven at Walt Disney World. Walt Disney World was at the high end of the range that we see between 17%, 18% and 22%, 23%. Walt Disney World really over-performed in the quarter internationally. And it made the year sort of fall pretty solidly in that 20% -- 18% to 22% range. So surprisingly, to some extent as was implied in your question, but we are still seeing very strong international attendance.\nRobert A. Iger: Yes, we don't get that much attendance from Europe really, but it was strong during fiscal '11. We've seen a slight slowdown from the U.K. this quarter. But by and large, overall, our international attendance this quarter is up, I think, just under 10% from a year ago. Now we're are also being helped by growth in attendance from Asia and from Brazil, so there's a good kind of global balance. And while we're certainly watching what's going on in Europe very carefully, the fact of the matter is that there are other markets that have grown nicely, and that's obviously a good thing for us. On the scatter side, I want to reiterate the fact that advertising for us was about 19% of our total revenue. It doesn't mean it's unimportant, but I just want to put it in perspective. On the ABC front, scatter pricing has been very strong this quarter, I think Jay mentioned in the mid-20% range, 26% over the upfront. But it has slowed slightly these last few weeks. That said, the option pick ups for January, February and March are running slightly above where we thought we would be, and when we look at the mix of inventory that we have left, including in some very appealing new programs that I mentioned, Once Upon a Time, Suburgatory and Revenge to name a few, we feel good about the inventory that we have left and our demographics are strong. We've been quite strong in women 18 to 49 as a for instance. So I'd say a little slowing in the last few weeks, up nicely over the upfront this quarter, and we'll wait and see. On the ESPN front, they have difficult comps from a year ago as was the case in the quarter that we just announced. They ended up up 18% for the year, which is a tremendous number. They have got a great product to sell. They have a male demographic that's clearly in demand, and they also wrote a lot of business in the upfront. Scatter becomes less of an issue for them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif-Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I guess a question for Bob and one to Jay. Bob, you announced the beginning of the succession plan, and I was wondering if you could discuss how you're thinking about your priorities for the balance of your tenure. Is there anything that you'd really like to accomplish other than the path you set the company on? Are there any businesses that you think Disney should be in that it isn't in now?\nRobert A. Iger: Yes, the strategic priorities that I articulated back in '05 when I got the job remain very much in place, starts with making great product. Interestingly enough, that's even more interesting and more compelling today than it was back then because the world is offering us even more opportunities to leverage great product, either because of new technology or compelling growth in emerging markets. And that's the real value proposition for us. I want nothing more for this company than to make great product. And I'd say if I had to go and mind over the remainder of my tenure, which isn't as brief as, I think, people suggests, it's to improve the quality of our output. Technology is a huge, huge strategic priority for us. I talked about it when I talk about content. Let's use it to distribute more effectively and to monetize better. It should also be used to make our product better as well. And we certainly see that when it comes to filmed entertainment, but obviously, in our theme parks. And then on the international front, we announced 3 big deals this past year. They're in my remarks, in China, India and Russia. It is imperative for this company to plant a number of seeds in the emerging world. When you look at the -- into the remainder of this decade or the next decade, growth from emerging markets is going to outpace growth in the developed world, and that's the first time that's happened in 200 years. So that's very important, sticking to our knitting and doing more of it.\nJessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And then I just wanted to follow up on Spencer's question. We know that historically, international visitors tend to stay longer and spend more, but are you seeing anything from domestic visitors, anything different in consumer behavior at the theme parks in terms of length of stay or spending patterns?\nJames A. Rasulo: No. Once folks book their vacation, Jessica, they pretty much are behaving as they have in the past. I'd say that not shockingly, if you look at the growth in our merchandise sales, it's a little bit slower in the mix than the growth in our RNA and our Food and Beverage sales, mostly because of some great programming on the Food and Beverage side that has kept that variable growing. But in general, we see our guests behaving pretty much as they have in the past. And as you can see in aggregate, their spending is increasing at a pretty heavy level. If you look -- step back and look at the overall mix, I would say that our Group business, while it has made leaps and bounds, growth back since the downturn. It's still only about 90% of where it was before we came into the downturn. I think there's a little more opportunity for us there because it's very strong countercyclical programming for us. But in general, the goal is to get folks back at the resort at our normalized levels of pricing throughout the year. And pretty much once they're there, they behave as they always did.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.\nDouglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I guess we'll do 2 questions as well. Jay, just curious if you could give us a good ballpark CapEx baseline if you excluded sort of building a new stuff for those investors trying to get, figure out what a normalized free cash flow level might look like since you've now given us a pretty good idea of the full CapEx. If we unload it and just look at baseline, what would that be? And then, Bob, you're experimenting about as much as anybody with digital distribution business models between Hulu and Netflix and YouTube and building a disney.com content portal. I just -- is there anything that you've learned over the last year that you can share with us that's influencing your strategy about digital distribution, whether it's in terms of updated thoughts on cannibalization with traditional usage, health of pay-TV ecosystem longer-term, what the best online business model might look like? Any comments would be helpful.\nJames A. Rasulo: Let me start with your CapEx question. And this is one that we -- I get asked often, and I'll try to give you some perspective on it. Five years ago or so, we used to be pretty demonstrative about $1 billion number being sort of a -- an ongoing level without special projects added to it. You have to remember, though, that in those 5 years, in the capital projects that we've put in the ground, which each have their own growth strategy, each is filling in different parts of the portfolio, when they're back on board, they all need sort of ongoing FF&E and maintenance capital to keep them going. So I would say that, that that billion dollar number is low. But certainly, we've been pretty clear about the levels we're spending in fiscal '11 and '12 being at the other end of the spectrum, being very high because of the addition of the 2 cruise ships, the Aulani Hotel, the work we're doing at DCA, all the work we're doing at Walt Disney World has really kind of created a bubble for us that is not our long-term plan. I think that you will hear about longer-term projects, Shanghai, we talked a little bit about as a contributor to 2012 capital expenditures, and that will sort of ramp up over time. Remember that only 43% of that capital is ours. So even though it's a big contributor, the Chinese government contributes 57% of that and we back that cash out of a financing -- a lower financing line in our P&L. So I can't give you exact specificity on our ongoing capital level, but let's say it will be higher than $1 billion but much lower than the $2.5 billion to $3 billion we've been at.\nRobert A. Iger: I don't know if I can really give you too many specifics about whether there's anything that we've seen that is -- stands out or is particularly compelling except to say that we thought the technology was going to create opportunities for consumers to consume our content in new ways and in doing so enable us to monetize in new ways. That's certainly coming true with deals like the one we mentioned for Netflix and Amazon and the conversations that we're having with a variety of entities, the number of apps that have been downloaded, the use of ESPN.com, the over 230 million likes on Facebook, the YouTube deal, you name it. It's a very interesting time for content owners, and there is a growing list of platforms that are eager to enter into deals for us to enable them to redistribute our content to support their investment in their technology platform. And I think we're only seeing the beginning of the beginning of that. I'd say if anything that I think is profound or interesting is that -- is how well some of the traditional media platforms have held up. Five years ago, we would've been talking about just how devastating the impact of the DVR would have been on the Advertising business. So we're finding that with roughly 42% penetration of DVRs in the United States and people who have DVRs watching substantially more TV, that the actual increase in ratings in DVR households is pretty interesting. And now that we can sell on a C3 basis, maybe ultimately, we'll be able to sell even on a C7 basis. That's all monetizable. It's not all detrimental to our business model. If anything you could argue, it's actually enhancing it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just 2, 1 on the studio, then 1 on TV. First, on the studio side, looking into 2012, the revenues may be a little bit soft just given the number of releases lined up. Can you talk about how we should think about the cost in this business in this time of the year? Can you keep costs down sort of keeping margins intact? And still, on that topic, you've had such big success with your 3D rerelease of the Lion King. How much more profitable are these type of movies? And with you plans for more of these rereleases in 2012, can we see a bit of a margin left there?\nRobert A. Iger: I'm glad you asked a question about margins. We don't measure revenue that closely in the Movie business because we're more interested in profitability, and we'd rather make fewer more profitable movies than more less profitable movies, obviously. We like our year ahead beginning with The Muppets, which has a huge amount of momentum right now. And obviously, The Avengers will factor in big time for us as a franchise for the company and as a real new Marvel tempo. And then we've got a good Pixar title in Brave and John Carter, which should be a big movie for us in March. We've done a good job at the studio of continuing to be vigilant about the cost structure of that business, particularly as things change in that business. I don't believe that we're necessarily at the end in that regard. We'll continue to monitor that business very carefully. We're trying to bring some production costs down, but we're doing so in part by basically balancing the mix of the movies that we have, making a few tempo films and investing aggressively in those, The Avengers is a good example of that, I mentioned Pirates earlier, but also making movies that are substantially lower in cost. The Muppets is actually a good example of that. It's a movie that's going to cost less than $50 million to produce, and I like the balance. In terms of the Lion King and whether we can turn to the library to continue to drive profitability, I mentioned in my remarks, we've named 4 titles that we're bringing out in similar form, Beauty and the Beast, Little Mermaid, Nemo and Monsters. They're all different circumstances than Lion King was. Lion King had never been released on Blu-ray, for instance, and it was a 17-year-old title and was a movie that appealed to just about all demographics. I think the films that we're bringing out are extremely appealing films as well. I'm not sure any one of them is exactly a Lion King in terms of the circumstances, but we think they'll all enhance the bottom line, in a couple of cases, enhance basically the brands Disney and Pixar.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then just quickly, on the TV side, any color you can provide on how we should think about retrans in 2012?\nRobert A. Iger: We're talking about retrans in terms of long-term, getting into details about when we'll actually be concluding deals, we've included some, but we've not said how many we believe we'll enter into in 2012 and when retrans would kick in. But you're going to see, as was started in 2011, a steady trajectory of growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alan Gould with Evercore Partners.\nAlan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Following up on Doug's digital question, what inning do you think we're in in terms of these digital licensing deals? And could you give us any sense of how much the company generates across the company, cable, broadcast and studio, how much revenue you're generating a year from the digital deals?\nRobert A. Iger: I was going to say it's still the preseason, but we're getting -- but things count and we are getting paid nicely. The sale of shows to Netflix, which were primarily Disney Channel shows, I think, is only one of several drivers of what our operating income was in the quarter. So while it's nice revenue, it's still relatively modest when compared with the revenue that we derive from subscription fees and advertising. The broadcast side, I think what you're seeing is you're seeing a new form of syndication popping up that didn't exist a few years ago, and that's obviously a good thing. And by the way, I really do think we're at the beginning of the beginning. You're going to see a lot more entrants into the marketplace for varying forms of SVOD or Internet-provided or mobile device provided filmed entertainment. And so I think, I don't know, to put it in perspective, it's going to continue to grow as a percentage of our income, but I don't believe that it will reach a significant percentage of our income, meaning approach, maybe 50% for many years to come. And that's largely because I think the health of the standard businesses of the traditional side of the business looks positive from a long-term perspective.\nAlan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: In aggregate, what did it kick in last year, $100 million, $200 million of revenue?\nRobert A. Iger: We're not being specific about it. Total digital revenue for the company is over $1 billion, but that includes a lot more than just, what I'll call, off-network sales. So on a $40 billion and almost $41 billion in revenue, it's still relatively modest. Interestingly enough, what we see growing nicely as well is online commerce, e-commerce. And we've seen huge growth there in Disney merchandise online. So when you look at, what I'll call, growth from digital platforms, it's not just in the Netflixs and the Amazons of this world. It's growth in general in terms of how we sell our product.\nAlan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Does that include the line booking of travel reservations at the Parks?\nRobert A. Iger: No, it does not.\nJames A. Rasulo: Which is well over $1 billion.\nRobert A. Iger: Yes, that would more than double the revenue we read from digital commerce.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi.\nJason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I just have a question for Mr. Iger. When I just look at the headlines or in the newspaper regarding sort of unemployment rates and under -- people underwater in their mortgages and the amount of sovereign debt, all of that seems to have pushed your multiple down to a pretty low level, and it's pushed the Fed funds rate to a very low level. Your after-tax cost of debt is probably 3%, and yet, almost like clockwork, when the recession began in '09, you began to allocate sort of incremental dollars towards expansion as opposed to a more aggressive equity shrink. And I just wonder, is this a decision you made before the recession started? And are you convinced that this is the best use of the marginal dollar of your capital as opposed to taking advantage of the low rates and the low multiple?\nRobert A. Iger: Yes, our attention in terms of our capital expenditures has always been on long -- delivering long-term value. And decisions like the decisions to invest in our Theme Park business are certainly made for the long term, either to expand our presence in the markets that we're in or to bring us into new markets, like a new cruise ship can do or a theme park in Hong Kong or a theme park in Shanghai. We don't look at what's going on that year. We believe in the long-term fundamentals of our business and our ability to drive pretty good returns on invested capital.\nJason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And so do you anticipate any change in terms of more returns of capital? Or you think we'll be on this path for a while?\nRobert A. Iger: Well, I think we've been pretty clear about our capital expenditures, particularly in the Theme Park business, which we know is where we spent most of our capital. We've not been specific about how we will allocate capital as our capital expenditures on the Theme Park business moderate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen and Company.\nDouglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Back in February, you talked about your desire to get the Interactive Media business to breakeven by, I think, fiscal '13. I just wondered if, in the 9 months since then, if anything, has happened in sort of the mobile and social gaming spaces that has led you to alter that plan. And how do you feel about -- you talked about wanting to launch Disney-branded properties, so how do you feel about the need to increase the pace of your output at your Interactive Media segment?\nRobert A. Iger: Our plan to deliver profitability to our Digital for, what we call, DIMG or Digital Interactive Media Group businesses in 2013 remains on track. The 2012 will be a big step in that direction. We've seen some very nice revenue growth in that regard in a variety of those businesses. The YouTube deal is another step in that direction, and we are sticking with the plan, which is to have a profitable digital business in '13. Was there another part of that question that I missed? I'm sorry.\nDouglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Just asking, I think you released, for instance, 2 games on Facebook this year. And I'm just wondering, you talked about your desire to launch Disney-branded games. Do you think you need to launch more games than you did in this year?\nRobert A. Iger: Well, we purposely dialed back the games that we were launching in 2011 for a variety of different reasons: one, monitoring developments in that social game space; two, really reflecting on the technological infrastructure of our business and wanting to make sure that it was sound; and three, focusing on the intellectual property that we were ultimately going to mine in that space. We have plans to launch somewhere in the neighborhood of 8 social games over the next 12 months. Some are derived directly from company-branded IP, Disney and Marvel and some are based solely on original IP. And this 2012 will be a big step in the direction of us using the assets that we bought when we acquired Playdom, and ultimately, driving toward profitability in 2013.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi with Standard & Poor's.\nTuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research: I have one question for Bob and one for Jay. So, Bob, on the theme parks, I know that heading to the recession that you were kind of rebalancing the mix of your hotels toward the value segment, and I'm not sure what you think at this time about what the optimum mix might be given the fact that it appears from what we're hearing, that the luxury end of the market has been actually holding up better than the value on any number of metrics, whether it's REVPAR or rates or occupancy. I'm not sure what you're seeing there and what you think about the optimal mix of those hotels at this point in the economic cycle.\nRobert A. Iger: Well, in 2011, when we finished 2011, about 40% of our rooms fit into what we call the value category, about 30% in moderate and under 30% in deluxe. Interestingly enough, in 10 years ago, it was about 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, so we've grown in the value segment, we reduced slightly in the deluxe. By the way, reduced slightly, essentially, it means it's due to the fact that we simply built more value. And I actually believe, if you look at the last 10 years, that's proved to be a great strategy because we made our product far more accessible to more people. And it has enabled us to not only grow attendance but take market share, grow market share, which was obviously very important, because as we move people from off-property, value-priced hotels to on-property value-priced hotels, we captured a much greater percentage of their vacation spend namely in food and merchandise and obviously on the hotel side. We are actually going to be opening another very large value-priced hotel, but we're also developing a luxury-priced hotel with Four Seasons, that's relatively modest in size and it's going to open, I think, in 3 years. I actually think that our strategy has worked very well. We look at our bookings on the luxury side, and we obviously feel good about that. But we've driven a huge amount of traffic in the value direction, and I think that is -- really served us well.\nTuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research: And for Jay, thanks for providing clarity on the ESPN NBA situation, although that kind of seems to fly in the face of conventional wisdom that ESPN might actually be the most vulnerable if the lockout should drag on. And I know you said that the rights cost reduction would more than offset any impact there. So I guess the question is, are you expecting any kind of carryover impact if the lockout should drag on? One way or the other, do you expect that to have any kind of prolonged impact? And is it fair to then think about this as kind of operating income neutral? Or would you actually look to perhaps benefit kind of in some way from this from a financial standpoint?\nJames A. Rasulo: Well, the comment I made applies both to a short-term loss of games, which we're in now, or for a loss of the entire season. In fact, we believe that there is demand for the categories that are strong advertisers on ESPN and whether or not the NBA is being broadcast on ESPN and, obviously, broadcast elsewhere. Those dollars are going to continue to seek that same male demographic that is going to find its way to sports. And the most logical place for them to find their way will be probably not shockingly to college basketball as a substitute and whatever else we have in our huge portfolio of live sporting events that can be broadcast in those NBA game slots. So we expect that those advertising dollars will actually -- the decrease will actually be quite de minimis. But moreover, they will -- if there is some loss, we think that, that loss will be more than offset with not recognizing the rights fees for the NBA for that season. We, by the way, on balance would still prefer to have the NBA season and carry through with our original plan of programming those games. But I do not believe that it will affect us to the negative financially if the season, in fact, does not end up happening. And in terms of future, I can't imagine. I don't think it's ever good for a sports league to find themselves in this situation, but I think the same argument holds for future years that we have a lock on this demographic with advertisers. They love to advertise on ESPN. We deliver the ratings, our portfolio is incredibly strong broadly and no reason to believe that we would see a long-term impact of this particular season of the NBA being locked out. But thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tony Wible with Janney.\nAnthony Wible - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: I was hoping you could comment on the digital opportunities with new windows. You have this syndication SVOD window, but are there other windows that you see that are out there in either film or TV? And also, on UltraViolet, is there any change in sticking with KeyChest? Or would you look to support UltraViolet?\nRobert A. Iger: We're continuing to explore the interoperability opportunities, and that includes continuing to look for ways that we can rollout KeyChest effectively. We still believe that the consumer will be better served if, when they buy a digital file, they have an opportunity to access it or play it on multiple platforms, that that's a good thing for the industry. But there are no developments in that regard. The first question was digital opportunities in windowing. I think it's safe to assume that the advent of more and more technology is going to result in more windows. We're already seeing some of that. But I don't want to be specific about which windows, I think, are going to develop first or which ones we're going to take advantage of. But what we're seeing in general in the world in more profound ways than we ever experienced is essentially a giant pop up digital media store. Not being -- that means that, particularly, with smart mobile devices, like the iPad, that suddenly the world is rich in opportunities for content providers to put their content in the hands of people anytime, anywhere. And the anytime, I guess, speaks to the windows, not just when people watch them on their own time, but when we make them available.\nLowell Singer: Thanks again, everyone, for joining us today.

Welcome to the Third Quarter 2011 Walt Disney Company Earnings Conference Call. My name is Deanna, and I'll be the operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Walt Disney Company's Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued 45 minutes ago. It is now available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast, and the webcast will also be available on our website, as well a transcript of today's remarks.  Joining me in Burbank for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob will lead off, followed by Jay, and then we will be happy to take your questions.  So with that, let me turn over to Bob and we'll get started.\nRobert Iger: Thank you, Lowell, and good afternoon. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong third quarter, driven by our Media Networks and Parks and Resorts businesses. Net income in the quarter was up 11% on a 7% revenue increase. EPS for the quarter adjusted for comparability grew 16% to $0.78.  Given the economic news of the past week, I'm sure there's interest in what we are seeing. And during the past few days, we haven't seen any change in the pace of activity in our Parks and Resorts, advertising or consumer products businesses. Jay will follow-up with more detail on specific trends in his comments, and we'll of course continue to closely watch key trends in these areas.  Over the past few months, we've had opportunities to meet with a number of investors and analysts. Since we obviously can't meet with everyone listening to this call, I want to take a different approach to my comments today and expand a bit on our strategy and discuss some of the opportunities we are most excited about.  Let me start with ESPN. The growth in our Media Networks segment in Q3 was primarily driven by ESPN. ESPN remains incredibly well positioned today, given its ability to deliver comprehensive, high-quality coverage of major sports events, the value it provides to fans, advertisers and multichannel operators and its disciplined approach to programming acquisition.  ESPN's long-term commitment to serving sports fans continues to pay off with growth in reach and engagement. Our research shows that each week, almost 107 million people watch, listen, read or log on to ESPN Branded Media. And the average person now spends 6 hours and 35 minutes with ESPN Branded Media each week.  The value of sports also continues to be reflected in the advertising marketplace. In this year's upfront, ESPN enjoyed all-time highs in both pricing and total dollars committed, with tremendous strength in our upfront NFL and college football sales.  ESPN also continues to provide great value to multichannel video operators. In Beta Research's 2010 cable operator study, ESPN retained its position as the network with the most perceived value for the 11th consecutive year. And ESPN2 placed second for the sixth straight year. So we're very pleased with ESPN's competitive position and the value we provide to fans and all of our partners. So it's certainly clear to us, and I hope clear to you, that with ESPN, the #1 sports brand, along with Disney, we own 2 of the most powerful brands in media. Let me also spend a moment on the sports rights acquisition marketplace. John Skipper, ESPN's Head of Content, often says, the next time we're the only bidder for a sports package will be the first time. And we never take competition lightly, and the fact is competition for television sports rights has always existed. But our focus has remained unchanged. We have been and we'll continue to be diligent in our bidding and willing to pay fair prices for rights that will benefit and create long-term value for ESPN and the company. We recently reached 2 new agreements that illustrate this approach. In May, we signed a 12-year deal for multi-platform rights for a wide array of Pac-12 conference sports, including football and basketball. This deal strengthened our position as the leader in college sports television. And last month, ESPN reached a 12-year deal to be the exclusive U.S. broadcaster of Wimbledon. Given our investment in technology, ESPN was able to offer Wimbledon the distribution platforms on which to air more than 900 live hours of tennis during the 2-week tournament. Matches will air on ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPN3, and this deal will enhance and expand our coverage of Wimbledon and add another blue-chip event to ESPN's great stable of popular and important sports programming.  In our recent sports rights negotiations, we have obtained long-term deals, and in addition to the 2 deals I just mentioned, in the past few years we reached a 15-year deal with the SEC and a 12-year deal with the ACC. Long-term deals provide us with greater cost visibility and allow us to build a stronger -- a longer term relationship with fans. Also in our negotiations, we seek access to broad multi-platform rights, extending from television to online to our authenticated service. This multi-screen, multi-platform approach should also enable more growth, particularly as new platforms and new patterns of consumption emerge.  During the past few months, we also pursued deals for the NHL and the Olympics, 2 attractive sports properties. In both cases, we made bids that made economic sense for ESPN, and we exhibited financial diligence and discipline and avoided burdening ESPN with new commitments that would have lowered ESPN's margins. Now turning to Broadcasting. We delivered earnings growth at our Broadcasting business this quarter, driven in part by affiliate revenue growth at ABC and our own TV stations. We are in the process of negotiating cash retransmission payments for our own television stations and license fees from our affiliated stations. Our own stations have already reached agreements with several large multi-channel distributors with more to come. And we believe our own TV stations are getting paid per sub cash retransmission rates that are comparable to what other station groups are earning. We have already completed license agreements with non-owned affiliates, covering more than 60% of our affiliate footprint.  And to give you some perspective on what this means financially. We now expect annual revenue streams to total between $400 million and $500 million by fiscal 2015.  At the Studio, we enjoyed strong creative success during the quarter. Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides became the eighth film to earn more than $1 billion in global box office. Over the past few months, Marvel's Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger both opened to strong box office results. Thor has earned almost $450 million in global box office and Captain America is on track to deliver similar results. Both films, along with Iron Man and The Hulk, are key components of Marvel's Avengers franchise. And Marvel's approach, starting with great characters and stories, attracting great filmmakers and producing high-quality films, bodes well for our next film, The Avengers, which are aiming to turn into another great franchise for the company. Cars 2 opened on June 25, and it's on its way to earning well above $500 million in global box, and Cars remains one of the most important franchises of the company.  I'm excited about our upcoming films, and tomorrow The Help from DreamWorks will open and we're very encouraged by the early response to this film. This Thanksgiving, The Muppets return to the big screen in a family comedy we believe will reinvigorate a once great franchise. In December, we will distribute War Horse, a Steven Spielberg directed epic from DreamWorks that is bound to get a lot of attention. And in March, we will release the live action film, John Carter from Andrew Stanton, whose previous films include Finding Nemo and WALL-E. In May, we will release The Avengers and finally, in June, Pixar's next original film, Brave, will hit theaters. Our Disney Channel business remains very strong as well. During the third quarter, Disney Channel's ratings were up 10%, while Disney XD's ratings were up 24%. And this past Friday, Disney Channel's original movie, Phineas and Ferb: Across the Second Dimension, which is the most recent installment in this franchise debuted to a phenomenal success, becoming cable TV's #1 movie of the year in total viewers and the #1 scripted telecast on all TV this year with kids. Disney Channel now distributes 100 channels around the world.  And now let me discuss our Parks and Resorts business, specifically our capital investment strategy. We deploy capital in this business with a focus on expanding our markets, providing differentiated guest experiences and creating long-term growth. In order for a project to move forward, it must deliver attractive double-digit returns on invested capital and support our brand and our strategy.  Fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 will be peak years for our Parks' capital spending, given the timing of a number of projects that were approved independent of each other over the past 5 years. And let me briefly update you on 5 of those projects.  Next year, we will complete our redesign of California Adventure, with the opening of Cars Land and an entirely new entrance to the park. The expansion and redesign of California Adventure was a must, to not only increase length of stay and attract new visitors, but to correct the justified perception problem that the price-to-value relationship for this park was not what it needed to be.  World of Color and the Little Mermaid: Ariel's Undersea Adventure, the 2 first attractions to open as part of this project, helped drive record Q3 attendance at the Disneyland Resort, and our investment in California Adventure is beginning to generate returns. This year, we launched the Disney Dream and next year, we will introduce its sistership, the Disney Fantasy. We have unique competitive position as the creator of and the leading brand in the family cruise market, and we're very encouraged by the Dream's performance thus far and expect this investment to drive mid-teen returns on invested capital. In Orlando, we are significantly expanding Fantasyland. This is the most popular land at the Magic Kingdom, which is our most popular park around the world. This project will double the size of Fantasyland and enhance the guest experience, particularly during peak periods. This is the first major enhancement we have made to Magic Kingdom since its 1971 opening. We expect this initiative will drive higher levels of guest satisfaction, encouraging guests to spend more time and more of their vacation dollars with us.  In Hong Kong, we are in the midst of creating 3 new themed areas, including Toy Story Land. We expect this expansion to perpetuate the upward momentum we have been enjoying in Hong Kong Disneyland.  And finally, as you know, we recently reached final agreement to build a park in Shanghai, and we believe the economic benefits to the Walt Disney Company of this park will be significant, given the growth we expect in the Chinese economy and leisure travel and entertainment in China. We are optimistic about the return Shanghai Disneyland can generate for the company, and we see it as one of our most exciting and important projects.  Each of these 5 investments exceeded our stringent hurdle rate requirements and is expected to be accretive. We continue to believe that investment in parks projects like these is an excellent use of the company's capital. In closing, we are optimistic about our creative pipeline across our businesses and confident our current long-term strategy will create shareholder value. Great brands demonstrate their value through all economic environments. And thus, with Disney, ESPN, Pixar, Marvel and ABC, we remain well positioned for whatever economic conditions we face in the future.  And with that, let me turn the call over to Jay.\nJames Rasulo: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll now take a few minutes to discuss our Q3 results in more detail and highlight a number of comparability items that will impact our Q4 results.  Media Networks was the largest contributor to the year-over-year increase in operating income, driven primarily by ESPN. At Cable Networks, growth in operating income was due to increased affiliate revenue at ESPN and Disney Channel resulting from contractual rate increases, as well as higher equity income.  During the quarter, ESPN was able to meet by a few hours the same programming commitments that it met in Q3 of last year. As a result, net affiliate revenue recognition related to program covenant timing in Q3 was comparable to the prior year. Thus, the $228 million in deferred revenue we mentioned during our last call was actually recognized in Q3. We estimate that the EPS impact of this timing shift is $0.06. Year-over-year ad revenue comparisons at ESPN were affected by the impact of the men's FIFA World Cup and Game 7 of the NBA Finals last year. We estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up 9% if you exclude these items from the prior year. When these items are included in the prior year, ad revenue at ESPN was down 1% compared to last year. At Broadcasting, operating income growth was driven by lower programming costs and higher ad revenue at the ABC Television Network. At our own TV stations, ad revenue was down 8% as a result of lower political spending in the quarter and the sale of our Flint and Toledo stations. Excluding the effect of these items from the prior year, ad revenue was up 2%. Thus far in Q4, ABC Networks' scatter pricing is running more than 25% above upfront levels, with some deals priced well above that level.  Ad sales at ESPN and ABC Family are pacing up versus prior year. TV station ad sales are pacing down mid-single-digits. I'll remind you that our stations generated approximately $55 million in revenue from political spending in the second half of last year, so station results in Q4 will face a difficult comparison.  At the Parks and Resorts segment, operating income growth was driven primarily by increased guest spending at our domestic parks and higher passenger cruise days, partially offset by higher operating costs. Results also reflect lower royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort and a prior year benefit from a real estate transaction at Disneyland Paris. Also keep in mind that operating results this quarter include 2 weeks of the Easter holiday, while last year, one week.  While our reported Q3 segment margins declined by 50 basis points, without the impact of the Easter shift, the Tokyo earthquake and the Disneyland Paris real estate transaction, we estimate that theme park margins would actually have increased by 40 basis points versus the prior year.  Domestic park attendance was up 2%. After adjusting for the Easter holiday shift, attendance was up 1%. Per capita spending was up 8%, driven by higher admissions, merchandise and food and beverage spending. Average room spending at our domestic hotels was up, an impressive 14%. Occupancy at our hotels was about 1 percentage point below prior year levels at 81%. The increase in per room spending that we are seeing is consistent with the strategy we articulated to reduce discounting.  As illustrated by our Q3 results, we remain willing to make a short-term tradeoff between modestly lower occupancy and significantly higher room pricing, as we believe that a return to normalized pricing levels will drive greater long-term profitability.  So far this quarter, domestic hotel reservations are pacing down 2% versus prior year levels, while booked rates are up mid-single digits.  Results at our international parks were impacted by lower royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort and a decrease at Disneyland Paris that was primarily due to the real estate transaction. We continue to see improvement at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, driven by higher attendance and guest spending.  Disney Cruise Line's performance this quarter reflected the successful launch of the Disney Dream, which contributed to operating income in its first full quarter of operation.  At Studio Entertainment, operating income was down from last year as a result of the lower domestic theatrical performance of Cars 2 compared to Toy Story 3, and lower worldwide theatrical performance of Thor compared to Iron Man 2. While we were pleased with the global box office performance of Pirates 4 this quarter, its operating results were comparable to those of Alice in Wonderland in Q3 last year, as increased revenue was largely offset by higher marketing and distribution costs, which were incurred in the quarter. At Consumer Products, operating income was up during the quarter as a result of growth in earned revenue for Cars merchandise and higher revenue from our Marvel properties. On a comparable basis, Disney branded earned licensing revenue was up 10% year-over-year. At Interactive Media segment, lower operating results were driven by the acquisition of Playdom, including $21 million in purchase accounting adjustments. Results at our console games business improved during the quarter due to higher unit sales and lower marketing expense, partially offset by the higher cost of sales reflecting fees paid for the developer of LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean. As Bob commented, our strategic position and strength of our brands gives us reason to remain optimistic about the future. However, I want to identify some comparability issues that will impact our Q4 results.  As I mentioned earlier, ESPN achieved many of its key programming commitments in Q3, so revenue recognition related to those commitments in Q4 will be comparable to the prior year. Therefore, the $228 million in deferred revenue recognized in Q3 will not be recognized in Q4.  Additionally, at Media Networks, we expect to incur higher programming and production costs at ESPN due to contractual increases in rights cost for college football, NFL, Major League Baseball, along with costs associated with our new ACC contract and startup cost to the launch of the Longhorn Network.  ABC faces a difficult comp in television syndication, given sales of shows in the prior year, including Ugly Betty and My Wife And Kids. At Studio, Cars 2 will continue to face a difficult global box office comparison versus last year's release of Toy Story 3. Additionally, the Q4 home video release of Thor faces a difficult comparison to last year's home video release of Iron Man 2.  We estimate on a combined basis the higher cost of ESPN, lower syndication sales at ABC and challenging studio comps will impact our Q4 earnings by about $0.07 per share.  And finally, we significantly increased our pace of share repurchase during the quarter by buying back 35.1 million shares for approximately $1.4 billion. Year-to-date, we've repurchased almost 89 million shares for $3.5 billion. We continue to view the repurchase of our stock as a very attractive use of our capital, and we'll continue to return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchase in a financially prudent manner as part of our overall cash deployment strategy. Now I'll turn the call over to Lowell for questions.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Jay. Operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of Michael Nathanson, Nomura.\nMichael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.: Let me have 2 for Jay. Jay, can you give an update, when you provided your ESPN pacing number on the last call, I think it was running mid-single digits. And it ended up, I believe, virtually flat. So what happened over the quarter besides it looks like a slowing of pacing. So what impacted that number?\nJames Rasulo: Yes. The World Cup numbers, and we're after the -- in fact, impacted the second half of the quarter and we're after the pacing's data that we gave as of the call, Michael, which explains the difference.\nMichael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.: Okay. And then let me ask you this on the Dream, it's now included in the revenues this quarter for the whole quarter. Is the Dream margin higher or lower than the average domestic margin? So is that affecting the year-over-year change in margin for you guys?\nJames Rasulo: Yes, it's incrementally higher margin than the rest of the Cruise business.\nRobert Iger: He's asking for the whole business, though.\nMichael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.: For the whole park business, yes.\nJames Rasulo: Yes, both.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Michael -- Spencer Wang, Credit Suisse.\nSpencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG: Just a 2-part question on theme parks. To follow up on Michael's question, Jay, it looks like the underlying cost growth of the parks are still kind of in the low double-digit area, even when you're kind of normalized at the onetime stuff. So I was just hoping you could give us a little bit more color on what's driving that since I thought it was a fairly fixed cost business. Is that just the impact of pension and other things? Any more color? That would be helpful. And then just secondarily, maybe for Bob, if the economy does weaken domestically, how would you address that in the parks? Would you revisit the promotion strategy that you've implemented back a few years ago? Or would there be a different approach?\nJames Rasulo: Let me start with your margin question. The reported margin numbers don't reflect obviously a lot of things that we have coming online for which we are experiencing launch costs and pre-revenue costs. And the list is: the Aulani resort, the things they're coming on in DCA, some spending behind our next-generation work in Florida, and believe it or not, some expenses against the Shanghai project, which of course we won't see revenue on for years and years. So if you actually -- I mentioned 40 basis points, if you actually add back those factors, it's about another 100 basis points in margin growth in the quarter. So I've said for a long time that yes, other things you mentioned like pension and so on are all part of the equation. But we don't see any reason why when these projects are coming in at their long-term revenue versus costs equation that we won't be able to get back to the kinds of margins we've seen historically.\nRobert Iger: And you also have to consider, Spencer, and Jay covered this a bit, but just to reiterate, our parks' footprint globally is simply bigger with more lands, more attractions, more resorts. There are going to be increased costs. I think it's right to look at margins versus costs because we simply are going to be running a bigger and bigger business. On the second part of your question, if the economy weakens, will we reconsider promotion strategy, yes. At some point, we might. We take a look at what impact a weakening economy has on us. As I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, so far, in the last few days, we haven't really seen that much of a change. Now we're currently selling basically a shoulder period mostly, which is the fall, where there is some discounting. Anyway, we'll take a look at holiday bookings as the year progresses. It's way too early to predict whether we'd be discounting or not. But my gut is based on the trends that we've seen this past year that it's not something I think we'll necessarily have to do quickly.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Ben Swinburne, Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: I wanted to just maybe dial in to the cable comment you made about increased costs. If you look at the first 9 months, your media net margins and certainly your cable margins are up nicely, as you've seen operating leverage in cable. Are we going to see margins decline in cable in the fourth quarter as part of the increase in programming and production costs? I understand it's going to be higher, but maybe just sort of putting in a little more context behind it would be helpful.\nJames Rasulo: Yes. I'm not going to predict margins, Ben, for the quarter. But there are a couple of factors in place that we think are strategic that are contributing to those cost increases, namely building Disney HD as well as XD, as well as Disney Jr. And then some of the contractual cost increases that I mentioned that go along with the new football deals and so on -- I mean the increased football cost, as well as the Longhorn Network and so on and so forth. So I won't predict margins, but I will tell you that those, plus some additional new program in ABC Family will have an impact on the quarter, but we consider those very strategic investments in the building of these networks and believe they'll have returns.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then just on the parks, you also mentioned I think book rates for -- I think you said pacing plus 2, is that a number that's relevant in the context of the 14% REVPAR growth that you just put up this quarter? I mean should we be looking at those 2, as sort of comparable? And if so, why the [indiscernible] The deceleration?\nJames Rasulo: Yes. I said -- maybe I misstated it, but just to restate it, we said that bookings were pacing down 2% in terms of volume but up mid-single digits in terms of price. And remember when -- fourth quarter is our peak quarter. And our peak quarter a year ago probably did not see the kind of discounting that we saw in the third quarter. So when you look at growing your rates in peak periods is always a little more challenging.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And last question, as promised. Bob, on the film business, you were one of the earliest ones to out call the trends in home video. You made a lot of changes in the cost structure. Can you just update us today on where all that stands? You've brought distribution together at the studio. Is there more to come on the expense front in terms of overhead reduction at the film business, given the trends there? Or do you think you've rightsized it?\nRobert Iger: Well, I think we'll continue to watch trends. I don't think they've necessarily been heading in any more positive direction. I think the attention that we're paying right now, the cost is more in the production of films than necessarily in the structure of the studio. And it's our intention to take a very careful look at what films cost. And if we can't get them to a level that we're comfortable with, we think that we're better off actually reducing the size of our slate than making films that are bigger and increasingly more risky.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Doug Mitchelson, Deutsche Bank.\nDouglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG: Two for Bob. One is real quick. Bob is there any timeframe that you could give us on the mid-teens return on invested capital that you expect from the cruise ships. And the bigger question, just on the flow-through to the bottom line from retrans, the reverse retrans, ABC's unique in that among the big 4 broadcast networks. It doesn't have an NFL package and there are some concern that the NFL will get some of those retrans dollars when they come up for renewal, and ABC doesn't have that. Does ABC change its programming strategy at all knowing that you're going to have this robust retrans revenue coming in over the next few years?\nRobert Iger: The second part of the question first. You're right in your assessment of the flow-through because there isn't a pass along to any sports leagues through ABC, that we've weaned ABC of expensive and relatively risky sports properties. And therefore, it's our goal and aim to basically maintain that strategy and to take whatever increased revenues we get from retransmission consent or what I'll call affiliate fees to the bottom line. It's solidifying basically, and I guess, improving way to manage that business. On the first part, the double-digit returns on invested capital on the cruise ships, it's basically -- our experience with the 2 ships that were launched in the '90s have been double digit. And so far, in terms of the Dream, we believe that we'll be able to maintain that same double-digit returns or mid-teens returns for the new ship, and then hopefully for the Fantasy, which comes on board next year, over time.\nDouglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG: Do you think that you would want to predict in any way? Over time, okay.\nJames Rasulo: Yes. I don't think we want to predict when that business is going to stabilize, Doug. But we are very encouraged by the first full quarter of the Dream already being accretive to our margins. So we remain a relatively small, I would call it, boutique cruise line, and it shouldn't take forever for us to absorb that capacity.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Anthony DiClemente, Barclays Capital.\nAnthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital: One for Jay and one for Bob. First for Jay, with interest rates this low, I know you talked about pension cost on your last call, you talked about it becoming a tailwind over the next 5 years. But just given the expectation as of the last month or so, it's kind of hard to get too aggressive on pension plan returns, I would think. Can you just give us a little bit of color on that as you see it? Is it possible that you're going to have make adjustments to your assumptions, including your discount rate? And then a follow-up for Bob.\nJames Rasulo: I guess like everyone else, we'll have to wait and see. But pension rates return have been pretty low for a while. We in fact, in the past quarter you'll see in our balance sheet and cash flow statement the reflection of a bit of a buy down of our pension liability because it was so incredibly cheap for us to borrow money that we took advantage of that borrowing to buy down that liability a bit. But I think it's something we'll carefully manage. Obviously the growth in medical and post-retirement medical costs is something that we are keenly aware of, have been dealing with now like a lot of companies for a number of years, but not something that we feel will either get out of control or will we be inclined to let it get out of control in terms of downdraft.\nAnthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital: Okay. And Bob, you start off the call talking a lot about ESPN. And I just -- it strikes me that ESPN3 could very well possibly be an undermonetized aspect of ESPN and Disney. And I'm aware of the sensitivities to putting more stream programming onto ESPN3. You have the leagues there, your suppliers that I'm sure are cognizant of the value of it and then you've got your distributors who -- you don't want to undermine the relationship you have with your affiliates by offering this content direct to the consumer. But I'm pretty sure that consumer wants more sports streams to devices like iPads and like phones. And so as you look out, as the negotiations that you have with both sides of this, what really needs to happen for more sports -- or live sports to be streamed to mobile devices via ESPN3?\nRobert Iger: I think we have a pretty interesting opportunity here, and that is to in effect have our cake and eat it too, which is a means of saying that with a pretty aggressive approach to authentication, reflected already in deals that we've made that have been long term for ESPN, we can incentivize customers to either sign up with or stick with multichannel distributors. At the same time, we can offer the multichannel distributor packages with new elements to the ESPN package that will enable them to sell expanded packages to their customers, which has the affect of really 2 things: one, raising more revenue; and two, providing the customer with an even broader array of sports and sports-related material. I mentioned the Wimbledon deal. ESPN has created the technology to offer just about every match, I think maybe every match, that would be played at Wimbledon over a 2-week period of time, and may have the ability to offer that to distributors, which gives distributors an opportunity to offer a broader array of services to their customer. I guess it's a means of my saying that in this case the relationship that we have with the distributors is a very valuable one, and it's one that we aim to respect by both protecting what we currently have and determining or figuring out ways that we can expand on it.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Jessica Reif-Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJessica Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch: Couple of questions. First, did you guys recently bought out your partner in India. Can you give us an update on what you paid for it and kind of what you see as the prospects there?\nRobert Iger: Well we own roughly 50% of what is essentially India's largest film company. And as we look at that market, Jessica, we believe that there's some great opportunities for growth for this company as not only the market expands, particularly with new technology, but as it becomes even more hospitable basically to foreign investment. And so, what we've done is we've actually made an offer to buy out the public, and also buy out our partner, which is going through now basically a process in India, essentially a regulatory process, as well as the typical process that you'd go through if you are essentially tendering shares. Our view on this, by the way, is not only about the long-term prospects for India, but it's pretty consistent with what role M&A plays in our overall capital deployment. I know that Jay talked about this back in February when we had our investor meeting, but we decided to take an even closer look at it since that meeting. And we determined that between fiscal '06 and 2010, we deployed about $13 billion for acquisitions. And we now estimate that 90% of that capital was allocated toward acquisitions that are creating value for the company. What I mean by that is deals, which our rate of return exceed the cost of capital. And so we now estimate that the businesses that we acquired for $13 billion represent about $23 billion in enterprise value. So our M&A strategy has clearly worked. By the way, when we look at enterprise value, we're looking at the value to the company in many ways. Pixar, a great example of that and the huge impact it's had on the Disney brand, as a for instance. So we're going to continue to deploy capital in this direction. We like growth in international markets, I mentioned Shanghai earlier. India clearly is another example of a high-growth market that we think investing in at least in today's world is a smart move.\nJessica Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch: And then on just new forms of distribution for television, I guess television and film. You guys made a very short-term deal with Netflix. I don't think you've announced anything yet with Netflix international or Amazon or anyone else. Can you just give us an update on how you're thinking about kind of the new models of distribution and how accretive it could be in the coming years?\nRobert Iger: Well we're in discussions with Netflix and with a number of other entities in the space. And I think it's likely that we will make more deals in this space. Our overall approach of late has been to make deals that increase revenue, while at the same time, protect and respect basically the multichannel or the channel distribution value that we see today. And so, we're looking at deals that are largely library in nature, meaning very little if any content that would be in season, mostly prior season. But also, trying to build into at least some of these deals, some form of authentication, not necessarily in the ones that you described, but in ones that it will allow access to our programming faster or in a more aggressive window, if the customer is a multichannel subscriber. I think it's a means of growing the business. There's clearly a thirst for film and entertainment, in particular branded, high-quality entertainment. And what we're seeing I think stimulated in part by not only higher connectivity speeds, but significant development in mobile technology, particularly tablets. And we're looking at platforms that are emerging that are creating all kinds of new business opportunities for content providers.\nJessica Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch: And then just a really quick follow-up, you mentioned retrans could get -- or retrans and reverse comps could get to $400 million to 500 million by fiscal '15, can you give us the base currently so that we have a sense of how it ramps?\nRobert Iger: No.\nOperator: And the next question will come from the line of Vasily Karasyov, Susquehanna.\nVasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: To follow-up on the M&A question, there were press reports that you were involved in the auction of Hit Entertainment in the U.K. And without asking you to comment on specific transaction, can you tell us how you view your character portfolio at this point? Do you feel like it's complete after you bought Pixar and Marvel? Or do you still think there is room for additional characters?\nRobert Iger: We have, as far as I can tell, anyway, the most valuable array of characters in the world. When you consider Marvel and Pixar and Disney, to name a few, and Muppets, by the way, it's interesting we continue to create value or mine value from those that we have. I mentioned The Avengers. I mentioned Muppets. I mentioned Phineas and Ferb on the Disney Channel. I mean there's a constant, basically, either refreshment of characters that we've got or invention of new ones here. So we don't have what I'd call a strategic hole, but we've looked expansively at opportunities across the world to buy either new characters or businesses that are capable of creating great characters and great stories for those characters. Marvel's a great example of that. And we'll continue to do that. But because there isn't a great strategic hole to fill, we've got so many already, it will be judicious in what we'd be willing to pay for them.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of John Janedis, UBS.\nJohn Janedis - UBS Investment Bank: Given the macro weakness in Europe, have you guys seen a change in reservation trends from international guests at the parks? And maybe on a related note, I think you pushed through ticket price increases in June, is there any evidence that you're seeing an impact on attendance or length of stay?\nRobert Iger: On the International front, we've actually seen an uptick in our international business, particularly to Florida. And we're seeing it actually right now during this quarter. Jay, you want to handle the other front?\nJames Rasulo: I wouldn't read too much, John, into the timing of the price increase. There's a lot of moving parts there. We generally increase in the course of the summer. Last couple of years, it's been a little later in the summer, but I wouldn't read a whole lot into that. What I will say is that whether you look at in-park spending or a per room spending, we are seeing the kind of trends that we strategically set ourselves up to see, which is to reduce broad-based discounting, use promotions selectively to fill the trough weeks that occur in every quarter of every year, whether it's a high water year or a low water year. And the net result of that is that across the board, our revenue per guest is up at our theme parks, and we continue to see that moving into Q4.\nRobert Iger: We also think that investment like the kind that we talked about earlier, does enable more price elasticity. So when you look at the kind of investment that we're making in California Adventure, it's not just a fix, what as I said, was perceived to be and rightfully so a miss creatively or a whole, it's to enable more price elasticity. We're adding not only capacity, but we're adding significant amount of fairly attractive experiences or attractions, which gives us the ability to price a little bit more aggressively, sometimes even in tough markets.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Alan Gould of Evercore Partners.\nAlan Gould - Evercore Partners Inc.: Jay, what kind of visibility do you have on affiliate fee revenue from the cable going out 5 years? How much of that is visible right now?\nJames Rasulo: Well as you know, we've done a number of deals that have been announced out there. We've got over the next 3 to 4 years some very big deals coming up. So I guess I would call the visibility partial. The deals that we've already locked in obviously and what their growth rates are, and the unknowns of deals that we don't have. So I don't know how to fully answer your question, but that's what the insight I can give you.\nAlan Gould - Evercore Partners Inc.: Can you give us a sense of how much is rolling off per year?\nJames Rasulo: No, I don't want to get into the details of the timing there. But they're big deals and they're hard to keep secret when they're in play. You'll know about it when it's happening.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of David Bank, RBC Capital.\nDavid Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: So my question is if you follow what movies with some of your competitors are doing with their programming in Hulu, and I would expect suspect you guys might be looking to do too, it would be to -- narrow the windows for content availability without authentication. For some of the content while potentially locking it in for a relatively long time. Question is do you need -- across what percentage of MSO and other distribution platforms have you kind of locked in authentication mechanisms for ABC? Do you essentially have authentication programs in place for the majority of distribution?\nRobert Iger: The answer is we don't. The only authentication deals we've done today are for ESPN. We fully expect and plan to do authentication deals for our other networks as well, but we haven't cut any to date. I will say, one thing you mentioned in your question, David, I don't think we'll make long-term deals for the content, because I think the world is changing too much. But you are right in your assessment that we'll basically push the window back or make access to the programming more difficult or later, except if customers are authenticated as a subscriber. And I think you'll see over the next few years a lot of deals done that enable this. We now have to hope that not only is the technology improves that enables authentication, but that the whole user experience gets better. This is a for instance. There have been over 2.5 million downloads of the Watch ESPN app. And a lot of people downloaded it, but they were subscribers to services that hadn't cut authentication deals with us yet. But even where there were subscribers to services that had cut authentication deals, the user experience still could be better. It needs improve. So I think this is kind of a developing situation. I think it's very exciting because of what it provides us, what it provides to the distributor and what it provides to the consumer, but you're still at the beginning of the beginning on this.\nOperator: And the last question will come from the line of David Miller, Caris & Company.\nDavid Miller - Caris & Company: Bob, a question for you and a follow-up for Jay, if I may. On the retrans comments that you made in your prepared remarks, how are you managing negotiations with your non-owned affiliates? Are you just basically telling these guys, hey, we want $0.25 per sub per month that you go out and get whatever spread you want from the cable MSO? Or are you saying to them, look, we want half of what you get from the cable MSO because we're providing all the programming? Some context around that would be great. And then also, Jay, I think it was 90 days ago, it may have been during the conference circuit that you mentioned that the pattern that you're seeing with regard to bookings at the hotels, particularly in Orlando was sort of structured around the value segment filling up first and then the luxury segment filling up first, just sort of both ends of the continuum filling up first and then the middle would kind of fill in later. Are you seeing any change at all at the margin with regard to the pattern of that particularly over the last 4 weeks with all of what's happening in the capital market?\nRobert Iger: David, I'm not prepared to give you much detail on the nature of the deals that we struck with our affiliates. I can say that there are different facets to them that create some leeway in terms of how the deals are cut with the distributors. But I just don't want to get into detail about those. But so far, ABC's made a tremendous amount of progress. I think it's reflective of the fact that these stations that we don't own recognize the fact that the world indeed has changed. And while they all are encouraged by the retransmission set [ph] Fees coming and becoming more and more real, they also realize that a lot of the value created comes from the programming that the network provides them. And that's why...\nDavid Miller - Caris & Company: What are some of the deals that have been cut?\nRobert Iger: You got it right, but I just don't want to give you the details basically.\nJames Rasulo: David, in answer to your other question, there hasn't been an appreciable change in the way that rooms have booked up from what you described and what I described. I will say from -- but I will give you this insight, in Q3 from a rate perspective, whereas rates were up across the board, they were up significantly more in the value and moderate segment than they were in the higher-end segments, as you might expect when you're coming off an economic downturn. That people at the end of the economic spectrum are going to be the ones that could not come and that they kind of rushed to it when they can. In terms of the booking window, we've lengthened about a week over the last 5 or 6 months from 13 weeks to 14 weeks on an average booking. You can read into that what you will -- I'm not sure there's a giant statistical difference between the 2, to be honest with you.\nLowell Singer: David, thanks a lot, and thanks again, everyone, for joining us today.

Our press release was issued almost an hour ago, it's now available on our website at www.disney.com/investors.

Jay is going to lead off followed by Bob, and then we'll be happy of course to take your questions. With that, let me turn the call over to Jay and we'll get started.\nJames Rasulo: Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. We reported Q2 earnings per share of $0.49, up $0.01 from last year. The underlying quality of our earnings was good, but our results were particularly impacted by 4 items which we estimate collectively reduced operating income by approximately $170 million versus last year. These items are: first, the impact of the very disappointing performance of Mars Needs Moms and the year-over-year timing difference of key Pixar DVD releases, which together reduced results at Studio Entertainment by roughly $90 million; second, an estimated $23 million impact on Parks and Resorts from the Easter calendar shift; third, the impact of the devastating Japan earthquake, which we estimate reduced operating income at our Parks and Consumer Products businesses by $25 million; and finally, a $34 million impact on Interactive Media results from purchase accounting from the Playdom acquisition. These 4 items collectively reduced EPS by about $0.06. Now I'll turn to the main drivers of our Q2 performance in our business segments. Media Networks operating income was up 17%, driven by growth in affiliate and advertising revenue at ESPN and Disney Channels, as well as at our broadcast network and our TV stations. At ESPN, ad revenue came in 43% above prior year. During the quarter, ESPN added 3 BCS college football games, including the National Championship Game. When adjusting for these, we estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up by 23%. In Q2, ESPN recorded lower equity income as a result of higher programming costs at our ESPN Star Sports joint venture due to its airing of the Cricket World Cup.  At Broadcasting, strong results were driven by increased revenue from advertising and from retransmission fees, as well as higher sales of ABC produced shows. Results were also helped by decreased news production costs. ABC Network advertising revenue was up in the second quarter, helped by strong pricing in the marketplace, particularly offset by low -- partially offset by lower ratings. Q2 scatter CPMs came in 41% above upfront levels. Ad revenue at our TV stations was up 6% in the second quarter. At Studio Entertainment, operating income was impacted by the timing comparison of key DVD releases and by lower performance of our theatrical slate. As expected, home video results were affected by the difference in the international release timing between UP, which was released in Q2 last year, and Toy Story 3, which was released in most markets in Q1 this year. We estimate this timing difference impacted Q2 operating income by $15 million. As I mentioned earlier, the Studio results were also impacted by the very disappointing performance of Mars Needs Moms, which reduced Studio operating income by more than $70 million in Q2 driven by both P&A spending on the film and an incremental impairment charge. At the Parks and Resorts segment, operating results reflected higher costs at Disney Cruise Line and the loss of royalties resulting from the Japan earthquake. In addition, Q2 results across our parks last year included 1 week of the Easter holiday, whereas the holiday period this year falls entirely in Q3. Underlying trends at our Parks and Resorts were solid. Domestic attendance in Q2 came in flat to prior year levels. We estimate that without the impact of the Easter timing shift, attendance at our domestic parks would have been up 2% versus prior year. Per capita guest spending rose by 6%, driven by higher pricing and lower discounting. Occupancy across our Domestic Hotels came in 1 percentage point above prior year levels at 81%. Per room spending was up 4%. At our International Parks, higher results in Paris and Hong Kong were offset by the loss of royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort, which was closed for about 3 weeks during Q2 due to the earthquake in Japan.  Our Consumer Products improved comparable store sales at Disney Stores North America and higher licensing results drove profit growth in the quarter. Merchandise sales from franchised properties Cars and Tangled were strong in Q2. On a comparable basis, Disney branded earned licensing revenue was up 5% year-over-year. At Interactive Media segment, purchase accounting from the acquisition of Playdom as expected, continues to impact results. In the quarter, we recorded $34 million in purchase accounting charges. Segment results also reflected product development spending in social and mobile games and virtual worlds. Overall, we delivered double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share to the first half of the year. Now I'd like to highlight the business trends we're seeing so far this quarter, and provide some of the key swing factors that will impact our results for the remainder of the year. At Media, ABC Network's scatter pricing is running more than 35% above upfront levels. Ad sales at ESPN and at our TV stations are pacing up single digits versus prior year. Both businesses faced tough comps in Q3 since they each delivered double-digit ad revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2010. Also bear in mind that last year's Q3 results at ESPN reflected the benefit of the World Cup and a seven-game Lakers-Celtics NBA final, while TV station advertising benefited from strong political ad spending.  You may recall that last year, ESPN reached most of its key programming commitments in the third quarter. At this time, we do not expect to reach some of these commitments until Q4 this year. We currently expect net affiliate revenue recognition related to program covenant timing to be $228 million lower in Q3 than in prior year. However, we expect Q4 net affiliate revenue recognition to be $245 million, higher than in prior year. Of course, a relatively small number of programming hours could shift some revenue recognition from Q4 to Q3.  At Parks and Resorts, room reservations at our domestic resorts for Q3 are currently running 2.5% below prior-year levels, while booked room rates are running double digits ahead of prior year. The increase in pricing that we're seeing in our business is consistent with the strategy we articulated to reduce discounting. I will also remind you that the last year's Q3 Parks and Resorts results included the benefit of a real estate transaction at Disneyland Paris, which added about $30 million to operating income on a sales price of approximately $60 million. We expect the aftermath of the Japan earthquake to continue to impact our business for the remainder of the year. While it's difficult to predict consumer behavior and the pace of infrastructure improvements, we estimate several cents of earnings risk for the remainder of the year. At our Studio segment, we are excited about our 4 big summer releases, starting with Thor, which opened domestically last Friday, Pirates of the Caribbean 4, coming to theaters May 20, Cars 2 on June 24, and Captain America: The First Avenger to be released on July 22. The performance of these films will be key swing factors for the remainder of the year. At Interactive Media segment, key game titles in the second half of the year include Cars 2 and LEGO Pirates. Playdom purchase accounting will continue to impact segment results for the remainder of the year. Last week, we announced to employees that we are implementing changes to our salary pension plans. We expect these changes will reduce our pension expense by 25% to 30% versus what we would've incurred under our historic program. While the estimated cost savings are dependent on a variety of assumptions, including the discount rate, we currently estimate total savings between $350 million and $400 million over the next 5 years starting in fiscal 2012.  Finally, we have continued to repurchase shares. For the fiscal year so far, we've repurchased almost 52 million shares for approximately $2 billion. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert Iger: Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon. I'd like to reiterate that we're pleased with the underlying quality of our earnings this quarter, and are confident in the trends we are seeing across our segments. The attendance and spending trends at our Parks and Resorts remain encouraging, as do the advertising trends at our Broadcast and Cable Networks. With a wealth of great creative properties coming in the next 6 months, 2011 is shaping up to deliver strong results. As you know, last month we broke ground on the Shanghai Disney Resort, our 6th resort, and the first in mainland China. This marked a defining moment in the history of the Walt Disney Company. Shanghai Disney Resort is our largest foreign investment, and will be a critical component of our growth in China. Our Imagineers are deep into the design phase and when it opens in approximately 5 years and will combine great Disney storytelling and beloved characters, with authentic cultural touches, tailored specifically for the people of China. In essence, it will be authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese. At the Studio, we're extremely excited for the May 20 release of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, the fourth film in our extremely successful, multibillion-dollar franchise. Johnny Depp reprises his iconic role, this time with Penelope Cruz by his side. And just this past weekend, we celebrated the world premiere at Disneyland, home of the original attraction, and the film stars are now in Moscow for our first ever Russian premier of the Pirates film. It will also release day in date in China and most foreign markets. On June 24, Disney/Pixar's Cars 2 premieres. The Movie directed by John Lasseter will continue to drive a significant consumer products presence at the Disney Stores and major retailers, which should sustain through the holiday season. Work is also continuing on Cars Land at Disney California Adventure, which will bring guests into the remarkable world of Radiator Springs when it opens in summer of 2012. This past week, Thor opened in theaters in the U.S. and in multiple overseas markets, and its current global box office is just over $250 million, which is a strong and important opening. This film, along with this summer's Captain America: The First Avenger, plus Iron Man and the Hulk, is a key component of Marvel's Avengers franchise. Marvel's First Avenger film launches next summer and will be the first Marvel film to be marketed and distributed by Disney. At ABC, we're currently in the middle of screening pilots and we're excited about the quality and the variety of the shows we're seeing. This crop of pilots represents the work of a new management team and we're hopeful these new shows will firmly anchor our primetime schedule in the years ahead. All signs are that next week's upfront will be a strong one. Last month, Disney Channel scored yet another hit with Lemonade Mouth, the top original cable movie of 2011, which helped Disney Channel post best-ever April. Disney Channel's newly branded programming block for preschoolers, Disney Junior, continues to flourish with shows like Jake and the Neverland Pirates, which is TV's top series with preschoolers and is pacing as Disney Channel's top preschool series of all time. Disney Channel XD continues to perform very strongly and is delivering record ratings levels in 2011, with double-digit year-over-year growth in key demographics. ESPN continues to grow in both ratings and reach. In fact, this was ESPN's highest rated Q2 on record. With ratings increasing by 10%, driven by strong results for the BCS ball [ph] games and ESPN's highest-rated NBA regular season ever. With its expert coverage of the NFL, the NBA, Major League Baseball, NASCAR, golf, tennis, and even Cricket, ESPN has created integrated digital platforms that keep fans informed and entertained.  Additionally, ESPN continues to lead the industry in its efforts to offer consumers more content in more places as evidenced by our recent launch of an authenticated ESPN realtime viewing app for Time Warner Cable, Brighthouse and Verizon subscribers. And finally last week, we announced the signing of a landmark 12-year deal with the Pac-12, the televised football, basketball and more, across multiple platforms beginning in 2012. This agreement, which adds significantly to ESPN's leadership position in college sports, is also a huge win for sports fans everywhere. While the spotlights shine brightly on Shanghai this quarter, work has continued on some other important parks and resorts initiatives. Crews are putting the finishing touches on Aulani, our Resort & Spa in Hawaii, which will welcome its first guests this August. Construction also continues on the expansion of Fantasyland at Magic Kingdom in Florida, which will more than double the size of 1 of Walt Disney World's most popular lands. And on the other side of the globe, shipbuilders in Papenburg, Germany continue to make progress on the Disney Fantasy, the sister ship to the Disney Dream, which will begin sailing in the spring of 2012. Disney Cruise Line also announced new 2012 itineraries that will enable us to bring the Disney Cruise experience to more guests and more places and demand for our cruise product remains very high. I'm also pleased to report the Tokyo Disney Resort is now open following closure due to the March 11 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. And following its best year ever with record attendance, Hong Kong Disneyland continues to post-strong attendance numbers this year as well. The multiyear expansion effort that will add 3 new theme lands is running ahead of schedule, and we look forward to welcoming guests to the first of these Toy Story Land later this fall. So as you can see, there's a great creative momentum throughout the company. And we're confident that our strategic focus on producing the best content possible will bode well for the rest of 2011. With our upcoming slate of films this summer, Disney Channel's continued creative strength and ratings growth, ESPN's ever-expanding sports offerings, new experiences at our parks and resorts and our aggressive exploration of growth opportunities in countries like China, India and Brazil, we're well-positioned to capitalize on the encouraging business trends we're seeing to deliver favorable returns in the years ahead.  Thank you, and we look forward to taking your questions. So operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: It's Ben Swinburne. Maybe one for either of you, I wanted to ask about the park's trends and if you'd qualitatively describe for us how you think the consumer is behaving out there or how they might be impacted if at all by gas prices and maybe the Wizarding World in Orlando, or if you think the attendance trends you saw in this quarter and also the Thor bookings are generally in line with your expectations. I know you're in the process of unwinding prior-year discounts and to work through that, but I'm just curious if you've seen any kind of bumps or slowdown in the overall consumer. And then just 1 kind of cleanup question. Jay, on the $34 million of Playdom related, did you say those were charges as in 1 time or is that a recurring amortization number?\nJames Rasulo: It's the latter, Ben, and you can expect to see similar numbers in the coming quarters.\nRobert Iger: On the Parks trends side, Ben, we work really hard to win the consumer of the discount. And it worked in the second quarter where we had slightly improved and in fact throughout Easter attendance and occupancy rates. And better pricing, which is really important. The goal remains the same for the third quarter. Whereas Jay mentioned, we're running very slightly behind last year. This time bookings-wise, about 2.5%, but our pricing is up in the mid-single-digits. And we feel that's basically in line with where we would like to be -- sorry the pricing is up in the double digits right now, for the hotels that are reserved on the books. And so with that in mind, we think that the consumer is willing to pay higher prices for good product, that's a good thing. They're still booking late though and I think that's interesting because I think there's still an expectation in the market place that there's going to be some discounting, and that's probably why we're seeing the trends that we're seeing. We've said this a few times, we don't really see much of a specific or direct impact from higher gasoline prices, at least that's never been the case. Of course we don't know what happens when pricing gets as high as it could get. But so far, we don't believe that's a factor. And we're going to continue to watch our pricing carefully with an eye toward not diving for volume at the expense of pricing, continue to keep our pricing higher so that we can send the signal that we need to send to the consumer that the economy is stronger than it was a few years ago, and that discounting that we obviously had to implement during the downturn is something of the past.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with Nomura.\nMichael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.: First one would be, Jay, when you look at the Domestic Parks business and just take away for a bit the Tokyo impact and the ships impact, what is the core operating margin improvement you're seeing? So this quarter a lot of different noise. We wondered are you seeing improved margins kind of apples-to-apples within the Domestic business and which other cost growth is there -- are there?\nJames Rasulo: Michael, if you account for the Easter shift, we did see on Domestic Parks a moderate margin improvement for Q2.\nMichael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.: And then, Bob, when we say we're short in Interactive, I know you had the Playdom accounting charges, but we had assumed that Interactive would start getting towards breakeven. And I wondered, looking at this quarter for the rest of the year, will we see improvements when the year is over, x Playdom charges of -- in profitability in Interactive?\nRobert Iger: Well first of all we didn't specify that we'd get toward breakeven. I think we talked to the Investor Conference about profitability in 2013. And it's a work in progress. What we've decided to do at Playdom had somewhat of an impact at least on our revenue this year. And that is that when we looked at the marketplace, specifically in social games, we determine that there was a great need to improve the quality of the games. So the games that worked initially which were relatively simple, were not only going to continue to work at that level. And given not just what we believe the consumer wanted, but what the competition was doing, we thought it would be wise to improve the quality of the games that we're going to release. So we took a 5-month hiatus which has not been planned from releasing games, to build a higher quality game, and then also, to restack our technical capabilities to deal with volume, or to deal with scale, which we are hoping to achieve. And the results so far have been very good. We released -- Playdom released its first real hit game called Gardens of Time, which is a top 10 and may even be a top 7 game right now on Facebook. It's doing extremely well in some of the typical measurements which are MAUs and DAUs. But what's really interesting is that it's monetizing very well, which is another 1 of our goals. While we believe that volume consumption measured at least by the standards that have been created in MAUs and DAUs is important, it's more important to create games that are more monetizable and that's our goal. So we got a number of games in the pipeline, some of it will be released in '11, more in '12. Some that are new made from whole cloth, not derivative, some that are made from other products like ESPN-branded, Marvel-branded, Disney-branded. And we feel good about the direction of Playdom, particularly with this new hit game in the marketplace. On the disney.com side, we are hopeful to launch a completely redesign of that site in the coming months. We're not making any predictions in terms of breaking even or increasing the revenue at this point. We're mostly trying to get it right in terms of navigation, user interface, universal registration and then obviously, opportunities whereby creating greater entertainment to better monetize mostly with advertising.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.\nDouglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG: If I could just do a follow-up on Ben's question and a question on the Olympics. For the rooms in the books down 2.5% for the June quarter, I think you get a 1 extra-week benefit from spring break. So I just wanted to understand the confidence in the underlying trends. Is the potential park attendance doing better than the room bookings?\nJames Rasulo: Yes, Doug, in fact, the spring break is so heavily booked that it doesn't really affect the rooms' totals as much as it does, local attendance and spending. So you don't see a big difference in the Easter swing that we talk about week to week in terms of occupancy. I would say that we're partially into the quarter. The timing of some of the programs that we had and when we announced them last year versus this year, has more to do with what I would consider a very mild and not easy to read as to where the quarter will wind up, change in the bookings versus last year. But as Bob mentioned and I did as well, the room rates, I think, there's a definitive signal there that our decrease in discounting and the room rate price increases that we took are definitely sticking. And what we've got on the books is significantly up to the tune of double digits from where we were in the prior year.\nDouglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG: And for Bob, I'm just curious on strategy, given ESPN seems like it's at this point where it can't get any more fully negotiating leverage than it already has, it has a ridiculous amount of leverage already. So when you're talking about taking on new sports properties like Olympics bids which are around the corner, are you at the point where you start to look at that stuff on an ad-supported basis, on a pure ad-supported to underwrite them? Isn't there a disincentive to go after new properties like the Olympics at this point?\nRobert Iger: Well I will comment on your ridiculous amount of leverage description. What ESPN has tried to do is obviously create a -- kind of a must-have product for consumers, and thus, a must-have product for distributors who need to keep their consumers happy. And I think they've done a brilliant job of buying sports rights and turning the rights into both profitability and significant brand building, which I think has led to the position that I just described as well a bit of a competitive advantage. Between now and when the Olympics rights that are being bid out occur, ESPN has a number of rather large negotiations with distributors to engage in. And so, there are definitely opportunities for ESPN to address its subscription revenue, based on the general program offering that it has, which is both a collection of events, including the Pac-12 or sports that's already booked and possibly, sports that it may buy. So I think it would be wrong to assume that the purchase of an Olympics should only be looked at as a possible generator of incremental advertising revenue. It would definitely generate incremental subscription revenue. I also want to say that while ESPN certainly intends to take a look at the Olympics seriously, ESPN is also demonstrating a great ability to walk away from opportunities that they didn't believe made sense from a bottom line perspective. And they've also demonstrated an ability to divest certain rights that they feel weren't driving the value that other rights could have. So it's going to be -- continue to be a balance. They're mindful of their profitably, they're mindful of their margins, they're certainly mindful of maintaining a great competitive advantage, and essentially, the must-have status that they've managed to achieve, which is something obviously that's incredibly important for the company overall.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs.\nJames Mitchell - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: I had a couple of questions on ESPN specifically. One was -- it looks like margins dipped a little bit on a reported basis, but increased if I x out Cricket World Cup depressing the equity and income of investees to cable and apps is that correct? And then second, I think you said ESPN advertising revenue is tracking up single digits in the third quarter. Now a year ago I think you mentioned that was a 14-point benefit to the ESPN add revenue for the World Cup and the 2 extra NBA games. So is it fair to take the single digits guidance at 14 points, and then infer a kind of underlying ad growth at ESPN in the third quarter?\nJames Rasulo: Let me take your first question first, James. The -- your analysis, as it stands, I mean we give the cable margin number and if you are correct in terms of backing out or the impact of the Cricket World Cup on those margins, the ESS equity number affecting the margins and the down drift, but they are plus 1 otherwise. And your second question, I want to just highlight the fact that remember we are now lapping quarters in which ESPN had incredibly strong advertising growth in the prior year. So we were up double digits, I think 13% last time around, and this time around, we basically are seeing what the impact of that, I gave you the wrong number, it was 31% last time. And we're basically seeing the impact of lapping of those incredible numbers, and that's where we're reporting our signatures up.\nJames Mitchell - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And the 31% was 17% x World Cup and the 2 extra NBA games, is that correct?\nJames Rasulo: Correct.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.\nAnthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital: First for Jay, on Parks, thanks for splitting out the impacts of Easter and Japan. I was just wondering if you had the contribution to revenue from the Disney Dream in the quarter?\nJames Rasulo: We are not going to break out the specific revenue, but Bob mentioned in his remarks how pleased we are with the booking of this ship. And in fact, I would venture to say if you try to get a state room between now and end of the fiscal year, you'll have more better contacts than I do.\nAnthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital: Jay can you split up the launch costs, please?\nJames Rasulo: I would call, needless to say in the additional cost that go with the cruise line, there is a straight up operating costs for the period that we were taking in revenue, and also the marketing and launch costs, which I would call the latter at about $15 million, between $15 million and $20 million.\nJames Rasulo: And to the point Jay made about bookings, our 3 ship fleet is over 95% booked for the current quarter, 86% booked for the fourth quarter, and believe it or not, almost 60% booked for Q1, which is pretty interesting, given the fact that the new ship has 4,000 guests on it, considerable number of state rooms. So we added a significant amount of inventory and bookings are very strong.\nAnthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital: And then Bob, just a general question about the Marvel acquisition. At the time of the deal, I think you talked about 1 of the bigger opportunities being in terms of upside in Consumer Products, benefits to television and this summer, we're seeing the integration to film studio, I just wonder if you can just talk about Marvel, talk about where you've seen kind of the most upside or downside versus your expectations upon the acquisition. And importantly, do you see any other potential acquisitions like Marvel out there in terms of IP that you can lend to the Disney global infrastructure?\nRobert Iger: Well everything about Marvel for us, as we looked at it was designed to deliver long-term value. And we knew that it was going to take time to get at some of that value because there were a number of deals in place, both on the distribution front and on the licensing front, that had to essentially wind down or be changed before we fully took advantage of what is clearly a treasure trove of value, both on the character side but also on the executive front. We're pleased with what we see as the potential for Marvel, particularly as we look ahead. We ended up negotiating with Paramount, an earlier exit from the distribution deal on the Studio front, which gives us the ability to distribute The Avengers next year. And I'd say that is our first, really big initiative since the acquisition. Because not only will we distribute and market it, but we know that Marvel is working really hard with the cooperation of a number of entities at Disney to turn Avengers into a true franchise. The release of Thor was a critical part of that because Thor is a component of The Avengers. And we feel good about the release of that film this year as we feel optimistic about Captain America coming up and when you add to that Iron Man and Hulk, we think we're going to have a big franchise on our hands. And that's kind of the focus at this point. We're also working on creating a Marvel television block for the Disney XD platform, and there's a show on the air, there's 1 in development, there's also development activity at ABC Family and at ABC, and of course, there's a Consumer Products side. We're well-integrated in international markets and starting to approach licensing in a much more coordinated fashion, less so in the United States. But Marvel's done a great job on its licensing endeavors in the U.S. and it's sort of, \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" approach in that regard. But we feel great about Marvel, and we feel really good about the quality of the film that they made that was released this past weekend, Thor.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen and Company.\nDouglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC: I was wondering if you could comment on what the impact could be, if any, to your ESPN affiliate revenue if there are extended work stoppages for the NFL and/or the NBA.\nRobert Iger: There are so many variables in terms of potential work stoppage. It could be 1 game, it could be an entire season, for instance. And so it would be wrong for us to predict plus the nature of our agreements with the distributor is also confidential, so we're not going to predict there. We can only say that if there is a work stoppage, even significant length, the impact on our bottom line should be negligible. That in part comes from the belief that ESPN that if there is a loss of NFL games, there will be a mad dash for mail demos and other sports notably college football, where ESPN has almost 300 games across its multiple platforms, including ABC and the ability to add inventory to those games by changing formats and drive substantially increased CPM rates, which you might even see in the ESPN upfront that reflects a concern by advertisers of possible work stoppage and their inability through the NFL to get access to mail demos.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield with BTIG.\nRichard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC: Just kind of a high-level question for Bob. You led this quarter with a financial review, which I think in 16 years, I've never heard Disney actually do. And we're just curious, kind of the stop process behind leading off with financials and should we take any meaning out of the change and how you thought about laying out the earnings call? And specifically on Playdom, I think this is an initiative that really surprises people. You put up a number that wasn't terrible last quarter for Interactive Media. This quarter, you're actually citing a pretty big number for purchase price that wasn't broken out last quarter, yet I think you owned it for the whole quarter. So curious kind of why the disclosure now versus last quarter? And the share count also didn't go down despite the fact that you bought back a ton of stock. Where there options related to Playdom that also came into play that impacted that? Just curious, because I think there's a lot of concern about the interactive side and why you're bothering with this piece of the business at all. So maybe if you could just kind of help us understand why you're doing this going forward, that would be great.\nRobert Iger: Rich a lot of terminology there on the order of our comments today. I don't -- I'll be surprised if it's been 16 years. I think we did it differently at times when Michael was involved too. We thought it would be appropriate for Jay to go first because we wanted to address we're in excess of $170 million in factors that led to a disparity between where the Street thought we would be and where we were. And we thought by breaking those down early, which I also did on CNBC, after we released the earnings and before this call, would be a wise thing to do to sort of get that out in the open as quickly as possible. There's no other signal in terms of anything to do with our -- the quality of our earnings or anything that would have a long-term impact. On Playdom, we had a $34 million accounting charge in the last quarter as to why that wasn't broken down, Jay, Lowell, I think, we just didn't considerate it to be particularly material, it wasn't the driver of the quarter, which is your call. We're substantially above where the Street thought we would be, and just wasn't an issue. But because there was a collection of factors this time around, we thought it would be smart.\nJames Rasulo: We also, even though there was in fact a bigger miss in last year's -- in last quarter's earnings in the opposite direction, we didn't feel the need to describe what factors might not have been accounted for by the analyst, 1 being the Playdom accounting, which you guys would actually have no idea about, but decided that there is a disparity this time around on the opposite direction we would point out 1 of the potential reasons for that.\nRobert Iger: You asked a couple of other questions, one I think had to do with option exercises?\nJames Rasulo: Number of shares outstanding.\nRobert Iger: I think we had probably -- no not probably, we had a significant number of options exercised because the stock price ran up to -- in excess of $44 a share. And I think that's probably what you're seeing, in terms of dilution or in the number of...\nJames Rasulo: Not specifically related to the Playdom acquisition.\nRobert Iger: Right. Was there another question related to Playdom, Rich?\nRichard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC: Just I think, the overall -- looking at people's reaction, people are just kind of shocked at the size of the Interactive Media losses, and so there's a lot of question like why did Disney need to be in this business versus just licensing its content to visiting those of the world. Why is this so important to you?\nRobert Iger: We've approached games in kind of a blended way on the console side, we've licensed and we built our own. As you know, we've gotten more conservative on that side about building our own because we felt the risks were substantial. We\u2019re looking at the social media space today, particularly games and believe that there's an opportunity to leverage current IP or create new IP in a space that we think is still in its infancy, still going through a bit of a shakedown but we still thought that it would be a wise bet on new technology platform earlier than maybe when we were betting our resources on the console space. So the opportunity for growth on the social games side, at least at this point of our entry, is probably greater than it had been when we entered the space on the console side. I guess the same would be true on the mobile side. We just feel that controlling our destiny and making some smart bets that have potentially greater upside, albeit bearing some more risks would be the right thing for us to do.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Janedis with UBS.\nJohn Janedis - UBS Investment Bank: First, just deeper into the Parks, how different are the trends between value moderate and luxury? I'm trying to maybe get a better sense of how broad the strength of the consumer looks across the category. And then I got a follow up.\nJames Rasulo: The typical trend in bookings is that interestingly, the earliest things booked are usually at the polar opposites. The highest end rooms for those who want to be, if you will, the closest to the magic, and then value related guests who know they are going to book in an economical way and want to be sure that they get in. And it tends to close towards the middle. Some of that is directed by us. We actually start to trade people up in rooms when the value segment starts to fill because we obviously, the volume is of great strategic importance. And secondly, the trend and we don't -- the general trends, and I don't think we've seen anything remarkably different this time around.\nJohn Janedis - UBS Investment Bank: On the third quarter, can you talk about what you're seeing for 3Q options and to what extent you're seeing more caution from the auto, CPG or food categories?\nRobert Iger: Option exercise or option pickups have been particularly strong, have been all year, extremely strong in the second quarter, continue to be very strong in the third quarter. Automotives have been quite strong, certainly for ESPN. There's obviously a little bit of issue or hesitation on the Japanese side, but generally speaking, it's been a strong category, particularly for ESPN, as has telecoms and technology and packaged goods.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.\nSpencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG: Two questions. First, to go back to the Park margins. Sorry to beat the dead horse on this, but Jay, you gave us, I think a $23 million operating income impact from the Easter shift. I was wondering if you could just give us a rough approximation for the revenue impact? And then also, were fuel costs -- could you quantify the fuel cost perhaps impact for Cruise lines? I know sometimes you guys are hedged, so if you know if that was material?\nJames Rasulo: Yes. Let me take your second question first. We are -- because of the volatility of the market, we are not fully hedged either on our theme park operations or cruise ship operations for fuel. But we are hedged to the tune of 1/3 to 1/2 of our fuel usage. I will only say that fuel cost increases were not a driver for the quarter, and I don't want to give you the specific number but suffice to say it was de minimis. Revenue on the Easter shift is about $27 million against $23 million of profit.\nSpencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG: And then maybe for Bob, I was just wondering, it seems like the TV station ad growth seems to be decelerating, that's in contrast to what seems to be a very strong national TV ad market. So I was wondering if you could just talk about the diversions you're seeing there. Is that just purely a function of the political comparisons for local or perhaps auto, at the local level or something else?\nRobert Iger: If you take the political out in the second quarter, the stations were 9% above where they were last year now. Now where in the third quarter, and then again, in the fourth quarter, we're going to be lapping what was an unbelievably strong second half of the year last year with political spending. So your comps are going to get even more difficult. In general, pacings at our stations have been relatively strong, we continue to have industry-leading stations in the markets that we operate and in most of the markets that we operate in. Let's say the back half of what was the third quarter might be slightly softer than the second quarter, part of that has to do with what's going on with the Japanese automotives.\nJames Rasulo: Spencer, just a little detail on the political. Last year's Q3 and Q4 were about a little less than $55 million of political advertising combined.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Miller with Caris & Company.\nDavid Miller - Caris & Company: Jay, just one quick question for you. Should we infer from your prepared comments vis-\u00e0-vis the Studio and Mars Needs Moms that the size of the Mars Needs Moms write-down was $90 million? Would you be willing to quantify it for us or are you even allowed to say? And then Bob, I want to ask you a question that I really never got to ask you during the Analyst Day back in mid-February and that is, where do you see the strategic significance or what's your sort of strategic rationale for owning the equity interest in Hulu that you do at this time? It seems to me that dating back to December 8 where you made that announcement vis-\u00e0-vis Netflix, the selling of some of that ABC Family content, the Disney Channel content for roughly $100,000 an episode to Netflix, it seemed like you were saying at least rhetorically, that you kind of favor Netflix as a streaming partner over Hulu, which is somewhat of ironic. I think you would admit just given your equity interest in Hulu. So with that, what's your priority for Hulu at this time, if at all?\nJames Rasulo: Let me take a question first. I don't want to be -- I'm going to reiterate what I said about the second quarter. The P&A spending of the $70 million related to the Studio, the $50 million of it was more in the P&A costs to launch and market Mars Needs Moms, and the remainder being incremental impairment. But I'm not going to go back and talk about what we impaired prior on the IMD write-down.\nRobert Iger: And regarding Hulu, we haven't lost interest in Hulu. And the deal that was done with Netflix, was not in any way, a signal of such. We got involved in Hulu because we thought it would be important to help support a new platform that could -- we thought could contribute nicely to the company. Not just an equity partner, but as in honor of IP, and we continue to be supportive of what Hulu is trying to accomplish. We never believe that Hulu would end up either through our contract, or any contractual arrangement with Hulu or on a de facto basis due to our ownership in an exclusive position as a distributor of the company, except where we specify that Hulu would have certain exclusive rights. We continue to look opportunistically at all of the new platforms that are entering the space. We know that between Amazon and YouTube and who knows who else is going to crop up, that it's a world where the owner of IP has substantially expanded opportunities to monetize their content. And we don't intend to let a platform, even one that we own necessarily get in the way of our ability to do that. We don't think that was right. That said, we believe in Hulu and what it's trying to accomplish, and I think they've done a really good job of building a very viable platform for consumers and a viable platform for distributors.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.\nDavid Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: The first is, Bob, historically, I've heard you say that the greatest strategic value to ownership in ABC is it's used to serve a first window to create content that you own and monetize it sort of globally across lots of different platforms. I think right now, the greatest opportunity to display content is probably on a non-serialized dramas and sitcoms. How do you feel about how you've been doing with that over the last couple of years and what's your outlook to fully exploit the ABC platform there? And the second real quickly, can you guys talk about what the timing of the compensation from Netflix will look like? Is it upon delivery of content is it over the life of the contract?\nJames Rasulo: The housekeeping question, yes, the payments for Netflix are along the delivery of the products for Broadcast.\nRobert Iger: Your question regarding ABC, in particular, owned IP. I meant what I said clearly that 1 of the core strategic values of ABC is as a platform to support the investment in intellectual property, mostly scripted, that is now leverage-able in more ways than we've ever seen before, particularly when you think of the global opportunities, as well as the new digital platform opportunities. There are other strategic value. There's other strategic value to ABC. In terms of our ownership of our IP and our success, we clearly had a phenomenal run, with Lost and Desperate Housewives and Grey's Anatomy to name a few. We've had some successes since then. And certainly, Castle is one of those and there are some others as well. But clearly, our successes these last few years are not as great as the successes that we saw some -- when it was 5, 6 years ago. I'm in the middle of so-called pilot season with the ABC folks, screened all their product, and I've seen a fairly wide range of quality shows, both owned and licensed. I'm encouraged by what I've seen in both fronts. I'm hopeful that ABC Studios is going to contribute, not only to ABC's success in terms of its primetime network schedule, but to its future bottom line because the ownership of IP. There's some really strong shows from the studio right now. And since no decisions have been made yet by ABC about their schedule, it wouldn't be appropriate for me to say anything more than my enthusiasm that I just expressed and optimism.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi with Standard & Poor's equity group.\nTuna Amobi - S&P Equity Research: So my question is on DVD market. Given the latest data point, seemed like the sell-through segment actually are falling off a cliff there. So to what extent, I know you guys have said that sell-through actually performs relatively better for you, given the nature of your titles. So I wanted to get a sense how much this is a factor in your quarterly results. It seems like I know there were some difficult comparisons. But beyond that, do you have any commentary, in terms of how your titles might actually performing would be helpful? I also saw that you called out Blu-ray pricing, which you haven't done in a while. So if you can provide any color as to how your Blu-ray titles are performing vis-\u00e0-vis a standard DVD would be helpful.\nJames Rasulo: Tuna, on your first question vis-\u00e0-vis, how this affected the quarter, and then I'll turn the rest of it over to Bob, the major driver in the number of units sold is the timing issue that I spoke about in my prepared remarks where in Q2 of last year, we released UP in most international markets. And this year time around, in Q1, Toy Story was released in Q1. So that was the major -- the majority of the driver in terms of what you saw affecting our quarter. We also, in prior year, re-released Toy Story 1 and 2 in anticipation of the theatrical release of Toy Story 3 and had that out in the market, which had an impact on the quarter as well. In terms of what we see in the future, I'll turn it over to Bob but we've seen very good results for Tangled. And our conversion, while of course it's impossible for us to avoid the overall secular decline in DVD sales, our conversion still seems to be holding on the right titles for sell through.\nRobert Iger: By our estimates, our title conversion has exceeded other studios for 8 of the last 10 quarters. And we exceeded the conversion rate for the other studios. In Q2, we just reported nicely by about 25% actually. And that was primarily because of Tangled, which did very well from a conversion rate perspective. But we continue to believe that this is a business that is undergoing secular change, we've been saying that probably for 2 or 3 years. We continue to believe that's the case. We believe though that our titles tend to be titles that people would prefer to own than to rent. And that's because their kids watch them so many times. That doesn't mean that every one of our titles works. We at times make films that don't convert as well because they're not considered a film that a family must own, or they don't convert as well because they're not very good films. And we've certainly had our share of those. When we have a decent Disney title, though, that is aimed at essentially the entire family audience. Our conversion rates are really stellar and that was the case with Tangled. As to Blu-ray, Tuna, I think we continue to see encouraging results where Blu-ray continues to creep up in terms of percent of total sales, as does -- kind of the multi-format concept that we're in the marketplace with, with the downloadable file, and ultimately, what I'll call the stream-able file. And we're encouraged by the buy rates on those as well.\nTuna Amobi - S&P Equity Research: Very helpful. Just quick clarification on the debt situation. So you have about $4 billion of debt due in next year. You talked about your leverage, your disciplined financial management. So just wondering here Jay, what you're thinking -- or should we expect that that's going to be refinanced? Or are you actually going to pay that down substantially? In which case, that creates even more room for a sizable capacity? Any thoughts would be helpful.\nJames Rasulo: We're very happy with the strategic positioning of our balance sheet. We like where we are, we don't see any fundamental changes in terms of vast reduction in our debt or for a no reason increase in our debt. So I wouldn't read too much into what you see between the shift between long-term and current. You probably know, we just re-upped our long-standing second half of our long-standing facility. And very happy with the pricing on it. And I just, Tuna, I just wouldn't look too much into the shift in accounts between debt categories.\nLowell Singer: Thanks again, everyone for joining us today.

My name is Kendall, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Kendall. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Walt Disney Company's First Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued almost an hour ago and it's available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast, and the webcast will also be available on our website. After the call, a replay and transcript will be there as well.  Joining me in Burbank for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob's going to lead off, followed by Jay, and then we will of course be happy to take some of your questions.  So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob, and we'll get started.\nRobert Iger: Thank you, Lowell, and good afternoon. I'm pleased to report we had an excellent first quarter, driven by strong creative content and our unique ability to leverage great entertainment across the many platforms, businesses and markets in which we operate. We also benefited from growth in advertising at our Media Networks, and improved consumer spending at our Parks and Consumer Products businesses. Net income was up 54% to $1.3 billion on a 10% revenue increase. EPS for the quarter, adjusting for comparability, grew 45% to $0.68. Next week we're holding an investor conference so today I'm going to keep my remarks brief. Our performance again shows the value of our relentless focus on three core strategic priorities: Creating great entertainment, using new technology to enhance the quality and reach of that entertainment and growing our businesses in promising international markets. Nothing epitomizes our commitment to quality, creativity and future growth like the recently christened Disney cruise ship, the Disney Dream. The Dream demonstrates how we successfully build on our legacy of great storytelling, technological innovation and first rate service to create a truly amazing guest experience as only we can. The impact on bookings for the entire fleet has been tremendous.  Animation has always been at the heart of Disney, and this quarter showed how incredibly beneficial strong animated films can be for the company. Tangled, the crowd-pleasing fairytale adventure, is close to $500 million in global box office, with Japan yet to open. And has added Rapunzel to our popular court of Disney Princesses.  Toy Story 3, already the number one animated movie of all time at the box office, did very well in its home video release, was a key part of the holiday success of our Consumer Products business, and I'm happy to say has been nominated for five Oscars, including Best Picture. We also are extremely pleased with the performance of our Parks and Resorts. Despite difficult weather conditions in the U.S. and Europe, we enjoyed increases in attendance and spending at our U.S. parks with new attractions coming online at our parks, our new Hawaiian resort opening in August, and the expanded Disney Cruise Line, there will be multiple additional reasons for families to enjoy a great Disney vacation.  Our Media Networks, led by ESPN, once again had a very solid quarter. The Bowl Championship Series on ESPN was a big success in its first year, with the Auburn/Oregon final being the most watched telecast in cable television history.  Monday Night Football had its highest rated and most viewed season since 2006 when it moved from ABC to ESPN. Disney Channel, with its expanded portfolio of original programming, had its best ever first quarter in terms of total viewership. And ABC, and particularly its own stations, benefited substantially from the continued improvement in advertising rates.  In sum, we are very pleased with how we've started off the new fiscal year. We've got a strong creative strategy focused on building our brands and franchises, a talented team and a consistent focus on growing our businesses in rapidly changing markets. And with that, I'll turn things over to Jay.\nJames Rasulo: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered strong results in our first quarter, with double-digit growth in overall operating income and margin improvement across all of our businesses.  Before we turn to your questions, I'd like to highlight the key drivers of our Q1 performance and discuss some of the trends and comparison issues that will influence our results for Q2 and the remainder of the year. Profits at the Media Networks were up 47%, led by strong growth in advertising and affiliate revenue at cable networks. Ad revenue for ESPN came in 34% above prior year, driven in part by strong demand for NFL programming on the back of another year of extremely strong NFL ratings. In the quarter, ESPN added two BCS games, the Rose and Fiesta Bowls. After adjusting for these two BCS games, we estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up 27%. Thus far in Q2, ESPN's ad sales are pacing up double digits versus prior year.  Affiliate and advertising revenue in Q1 were also up at Disney Channel worldwide. In addition, results benefited from higher equity income from ANE Lifetime driven by improved performance.  At broadcasting, results benefited from higher advertising at our owned TV stations, cost reduction in news and daytime production and the shift of the Rose Bowl to ESPN. Ad revenue at our TV stations was up 20% from prior Q1, driven by higher political advertising demand. So far in Q2, ad sales pacings at the TV stations are up double digits versus prior year. At the Networks, scatter CPM pricing in Q1 came in 24% above upfront levels. So far this quarter, scatter pricing for ABC is running over 30% above upfront levels.  At Studio Entertainment, operating income improved significantly year-over-year, driven by reduced home entertainment distribution and marketing costs. In addition, increased home video units were driven by Toy Story 3's strong Home Entertainment performance and its earlier international release dates compared to last year's release of Up. Results were also helped by lower film write-downs. Our Parks segment delivered strong double-digit operating income growth, driven primarily by higher guest spending, as well as increased room nights and attendance. Margins grew by 220 basis points, despite increased expenses from labor cost inflation and higher pension and healthcare costs, as well as expenses associated with our newly launched ship, the Disney Dream, and our Disney California Adventure expansion.  Domestic attendance came in 2% above prior year levels. Higher admission pricing in part due to a reduction in discounting, and higher food and beverage spending helped drive an 8% increase in per capita guest spending.  Occupancy across our domestic hotels came in four percentage points above prior year levels at 85%. Average room spending was up 4%. Results also improved at our international parks, with higher guest spending and room nights in Paris and Hong Kong. Looking ahead, domestic room reservations for Q2 are currently running 3% above prior year levels.  At Consumer Products we enjoyed continued strength in our Licensing business, primarily driven by Toy Story merchandise. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up 12% year-over-year. Higher results also reflected the inclusion of Marvel licensing and publishing business, and improved performance at our Disney Stores North America. Operating performance in the Interactive Media segment was in line with prior year. Solid results from our self-published games, particularly Epic Mickey and Toy Story 3, were offset by the consolidation of Playdom. Playdom's results were largely driven by purchase accounting, which will continue to impact results for the remainder of the year.  We continue to be very pleased with advertising and park trends and remain excited about our product lineup for the remainder of the year. Separate from these trends, however, there are a few comparability issues I want to bring to your attention that will impact our Q2 report results. At Media Networks, ESPN's results will be impacted by the cost of adding three BCS games, as well as airing the Cricket World Cup by our ESPN Star Sports joint venture. Studio Entertainment faces tough comps given last year's release of Alice in Wonderland in Q2, as we have no comparable release planned this quarter. In addition Home Video comparisons will be difficult given that Up was released in many international markets in Q2 of last year.  I also want to remind you that the timing of the Easter holiday will impact our Parks and Resort results, falling entirely in Q3 this year versus last year when one week of the holiday period fell into Q2. Our Q2 results will also include costs associated with the January launch of our new cruise ship, the Disney Dream. During Q1, we've continued to repurchase shares. For the fiscal year so far, we've purchased over 28 million shares for approximately $1 billion. Our 2011 is off to a very good start, and we look forward to discussing our strategy and initiatives in more detail with you next week at our Investor Conference. With that, I'll turn the call back to Lowell for Q&A.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Jay. As everyone knows, we will be hosting an Investor Conference next week, and that investor conference will be webcast. At the conference, management will address a variety of key strategic issues. As such, to the extent possible, we'd like to use today's call to address your questions about our Q1 results and current trends since we don't plan to focus on those topics next week.  We are certainly allocating time during next week's conference to answer your broader strategic questions. So with that preface, operator, we're ready to take the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Jay, just want to go back on your comments on ESPN advertising, I think last quarter, you said that ESPN was pacing double-digits and you put up a plus 34 or a plus 27 adjusted. So just trying to see if you could be a little more fine with the double-digit pacing in the Q2 comment that you made. And then on the Studio, I'm sure you benefited for some licensing film share in the quarter, given how strong your product line-up has been. But you spent the last two years right-sizing the cost structure there. So any help you could give us on sort of how much cost that sort of annualized in terms of overhead savings you've taken out of the Studio over the last two years so we can think about sort of the underlying profitability would be helpful.\nJames Rasulo: Let me take your first question about advertising. I don't want to be more explicit than up double digits for ESPN. We really are not in the habit of giving explicit guidance, and I think we'll leave it at that. Relative to the Studio returns, there clearly were particularly in our distribution, Bob and I have talked a lot about how we have reoriented our distribution organization and our marketing organizations to really span all of the channels of a film's release. And part of the benefit of that has been felt in the Home Entertainment segment where we really have reduced both the marketing and distribution costs of taking our product to market. So the savings that are there and the improvement were not solely related to film share by any stretch of the imagination. What that annualizes out at is -- I'm not going to get into. There are different numbers of the releases and different products in the market every year and how we market them. I don't want to make a commitment about how that cost is going to annualize.\nRobert Iger: Ben, this is Bob. I'll add one thing about ESPN, and that is that, while we're not going to give any more details about pacings from a percentage perspective, it's safe to assume that the sports advertising marketplace is extremely robust, as is by the way the overall marketplace. And ESPN's seeing strength from multiple sectors. There's certainly real strength in automotives, in retail, in telcos, in various forms of consumer electronics, even to the point where they've been able to add units in this quarter to take advantage of demand. In programs like SportsCenter and PTI. So they're seeing a very, very strong marketplace.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Spencer Wang with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nSpencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG: For either Bob or Jay, in the event that there is a work stoppage for either the NFL or the NBA, can you just walk us through how that would impact expenses recognized? And would there be an impact on affiliate revenues just given the programming covenants. And then one housekeeping question on the quarter for Jay, I guess, if you x out the new year shift in the year-ago quarter what would attendance have been up year-over-year?\nRobert Iger: We have provisions in our NBA and NFL contracts that deal with potential for loss of games for a variety of different reasons, including work stoppage over labor disagreement. But we do not make the details of those provisions public, which is our obligation to the league, just as we don't make much of the detail of these contracts public. I think that you're pretty familiar with the program covenant that we have with the cable operators, where we don't recognize revenue until we achieve a certain level in terms of live programming. We don't make the details of that available either in terms of the number of hours live programming or the components that we have to deliver. So I think it would be best right now just to not provide any more detail than that.\nJames Rasulo: On your question on Q1 attendance, there wasn't any new year's impact between the two years.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJessica Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch: Could you tell us what retransmission consent is up to now, and if you could include reverse comp that would be great. And how much further improvement can you make in fiscal '11 and fiscal '12? And I wanted to follow up, I think Jay said that the opening of the Dream drove cruise bookings. Can you give us any color on what the impact was on overall bookings? Because obviously there's more inventory, and Dream is a bigger ship with higher prices. Bob, you mentioned in the shareholder letter this year, you actually discussed the Shanghai park and I was just wondering if the deal has actually been finalized.\nRobert Iger: Retransmission consent. We've cut some deals and reversed compensation. We've cut some deals already, Time Warner being I think the most obvious. There will be more deals to come. We fully expect to gain retransmission consent payments from distributors as deals that are currently in place expire. And we can't give you a sense for when those are, but there are negotiations going on just about all the time, nor can we tell you the percentage of deals that we've already completed or the amount of revenue that we're bringing in. We may give you some ranges about once all these deals are done, what it might mean in terms of steady-state revenue improvement, but we'll discuss that next week at the Investor Conference. The second question about the Dream, Jay I think mentioned in his opening comments that bookings for all three ships were quite strong. They are running over 80% for the year. The Dream itself is 89% booked for the year. So there's considerable interest in our Cruise business. We believe that the fact that the Dream is so booked, particularly during peak periods has actually driven people whose interest was sparked in part by the addition of the new ship to our other ships and our other itineraries. It's been very positive for us. And we've also been selling basically new cruises to people who have been on the Dream. So we've seen some encouraging reaction to people who are already sailing on the Dream who want to come back. On Shanghai, we've signed multiple agreements with the Shanghai government and our prospective partners for Shanghai Disneyland. We had received, prior to signing those agreements, preliminary approval from the Beijing or the central government, and we're now awaiting a final or formal approval from the Beijing government before we make a formal announcement and actually break ground. And we're not going to speculate when that will be.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.\nDouglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG: If you look at fiscal '01 to fiscal '02, Parks dropped in EBIT about $600 million or so took about four years after that to get back to that prior profit level. Fiscal '08 to fiscal '10 again dropped almost $600 million in EBIT, but you did improve $6 million domestically in one quarter. So the question is, it looks like you're more on pace to recover in two years, and it looks like you're hitting an inflection point at the Parks in the recovery and, one, is that accurate, do you sort of feel that momentum? And two, if so, if it looks like it could recover faster than last time, is there anything you can point to any particular factors that is driving that?\nJames Rasulo: I would say this. I think it's clear that we have what we've been saying for the last couple of quarters, about implementing a strategy to bring us back to our normalized pricing at, as we're waiting for demand to come back it has clearly manifested itself again in this quarter, as we discussed last quarter. And so, we're certainly on a trajectory that we expected to be on and talked about. I don't want to be explicit about the timing, but I will tell you that from our perspective, the combination of continuing to add great product to our parks around the world, as well as the interest in travel definitely coming back and the sense that we have incredible value in the way we priced our products is manifesting itself in a lot of interest. Bob mentioned what's going on in our Cruise business, just blowing the doors off in terms of demand and interest. And we're seeing that in the volume as we gave out the numbers in both our domestic parks, as well as in Hong Kong and in Paris. So it's very broad-based, but the speed and rate of trajectory, I don't want to take a guess about that.\nRobert Iger: We're still seeing, Doug, a consumer that's shopping for value, and that's still shopping late. There isn't a significant change in booking window for instance. So you still have an environment that, while less challenged than it was certainly a year ago, it still has its challenges. Another thing that I think is interesting, and we pointed this out before, if you look back at the early part of the last decade, when we obviously experienced some difficult recession and other significant events like 9/11 and Mid East war, we're much better positioned today than we were then in terms of the mix of value-priced rooms, where back then we had a larger percentage of premium priced rooms and now, we've built and we continue to build with, in fact, we're building right now a new value priced resort in Orlando. And so we're more accessible and we're more accessibly priced then we were then, and it doesn't have to do with discounting. It just has to do with the inventory that we currently are making available. I think that's a positive thing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with Nomura.\nMichael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein: Jay, it looks like, I think affiliate fees grew about 9% this quarter and I wonder, is there anything unusual in this quarter, now what will peak for the year? Is there anything onetime in affiliate fee growth this quarter?\nJames Rasulo: Just a couple of things. I wouldn't call it anything unusual, but remember that we are now operating under the Time Warner agreement and subs have resumed their growth. And that has contributed to increased affiliate fees. I wouldn't call those unusual, but they're definitely contributing factors.\nMichael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein: Bob, when you bought Marvel, one of the things you talked about was taking control of the international licensing of Marvel. And now you've had it for a good part of a year, I wonder if you could just update us on what you see in the licensing side from Marvel directly under Disney's leadership?\nRobert Iger: Well we're pleased with the integration that we've done internationally, moving out basically third-party agents and replacing them with Disney licensing people. We've been working really hard with Marvel to basically get up to speed with all the Marvel properties. And their general approach to licensing in the marketplace. We had in the market last year as a new product, Iron Man, and from a licensing perspective, that was slightly less than we would've liked it to have been. Still a very strong product. Coming into the market for '11 is Thor and Captain America. And then of course in 2012, Avengers, which features as we all know Captain America, and Hulk, Thor, and Iron Man. And we're very, very excited about that as a potential franchise for the company. So a lot of the work that we've been doing is essentially managing what I'll call day-to-day under now one company roof, and preparing ourselves for what we believe are the great prospects for franchises in the future, notably Avengers, and then hopefully ultimately Iron Man after that. We feel good about their product pipeline, and we feel good about the work we've been doing to learn more about Marvel and the overall licensing opportunities, and obviously, to put the organizations together.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield with BTIG.\nRichard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC: On theme parks, you both -- I think, Bob you started out by asking or mentioning that weather, both domestically and internationally, played a factor in the quarter, and yet you were still up in attendance. I'm curious, any way to think about the impact on revenues or profits that you think you lost or impacted by people who couldn't make it et cetera. And then two, I think Tom Staggs was quoted in the last week answering a question related to the impact of Potter Land Universal basically saying, \"It's safe to say it didn't help us, but it didn't really hurt us.\" And we're just hoping maybe you could expand on how much of an impact do you think Harry Potter has had on you? And do you think as that starts to wear off, in terms of the newness of that park, would that actually benefit results going forward in the next few quarters?\nRobert Iger: We've had a trifecta in terms of weather in December with a horrible ice and snow storm across Europe that basically brought Europe to a standstill. Then we had a week of torrential rain in Southern California, then we had a major Northeast blizzard right after Christmas that shut all the airports down across the Northeast and made it impossible to travel. We fully expected that there would be a lot of people from that area that would be going down to Orlando as a for instance. But we cannot quantify exactly what it is that we lost from a revenue perspective. By the way in California, we may have made up for some of it once the rain stopped because you get a lot of local attendance particularly during the holiday season when kids are out of school but it's just really difficult to quantify. I'll let Jay take a stab at Harry Potter Land. Except I will say that they've built a great property down there, not meant to be an advertisement for the competitor. And I believe that when a competitor puts a good property in the marketplace, it brings more people to the market. So I think it stimulates attendance to Orlando. And we all know that, that's good for us because we usually get a good piece of all visitation to Orlando.\nJames Rasulo: Right, just continuing on that, I mentioned that our domestic parks were up 2%, Orlando was actually up more than 2%. So the impact, if there is any, of what Bob is probably being swamped by what Bob described, that to the extent that it brings more people to the market, we do get a big share of that. On your other question related to weather impacts, I only give you this insight. Needless to say, local people are more affected in general by weather than long-distance people. And across the quarter, our attendance was down on the resident side, but very much up on the international and long distance tourist side. So it gives directionally some sense that we were definitely hurt by weather within the quarter. Whether that's a lasting effect, it usually isn't.\nRichard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC: Jay, you said that Domestic was up 2% in total but Orlando was up more than 2%. Was California actually up as well?\nJames Rasulo: California Park was slightly down for the quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Barclays Capital.\nAnthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital: I have two questions: One is on ESPN, the other one's on the Parks. Just wondering, ad pricing in the scatter market, I'm just wondering your ratings are way up. And so trying to just disaggregate pricing in units and wondering if you're seeing the premium versus upfront pricing widen as we move forward in time here.\nRobert Iger: Scatter pricing at the network is up about 30% over the upfront, and up double digits at ESPN. ESPN actually participates in a few different upfronts. So it's a slightly more difficult thing, except my comments earlier about ESPN's advertising marketplace obviously are relevant here. They're just having a gangbuster advertising revenue quarter right now, and we believe that's going to continue. Is there a second part of that question that I missed?\nAnthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital: I have a different question on parks. Jay, I think you say that Q2 room reservations at the parks are pacing up 3% as of now. Presumably, that is inclusive of the difficult Easter comparison. So I'm just wondering if you can give us a more normalized estimate or roughly what would that 3% equate to? I don't know if it's possible, if you could normalize out the Easter comp.\nJames Rasulo: There's not a big room night move on the Easter comp in terms of occupancy. Basically, it's more on the rate and spending side. And the day visitor side, that affects the weeks of Easter in the quarter. The occupancy is not that different so I wouldn't make a big adjustment for it. The OI move, as I've discussed, in previous quarters of the Easter shift, is about $20 million. Round numbers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alan Gould with Evercore Partners.\nAlan Gould - Evercore Partners Inc.: Jay, on the balance sheet, projects in progress increased $800 million. Is that the cruise ship and other assets went down $700 million? Can you just give us an idea of what's happening there? And then in terms of the hotel bookings at the theme park, they were up 3% as Anthony just said, they were up 5% in the last conference call. I'm wondering what the difference is for the slowdown it sounds like trends are excellent, so is it just that pricing is much higher than it was a quarter ago?\nJames Rasulo: Pricing is -- let me answer your question in reverse order, pricing is higher than it was a quarter ago. That probably doesn't account for the difference between the 5% and 3%. Remember, you're comparing quarter on quarter and we've been increasing our occupancy and bookings over the last four or five quarters. I wouldn't read a big difference between 3% and 5% at this point anyway. And on your first question, to be explicit, yes, it's the cruise ship and it's the Miramax sale.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs.\nJames Mitchell - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Can you talk a little bit more about the consumer products revenue growth? Just looking at the Q, you had very good headline revenue growth in that provision, but a chunk of it came from the Marvel acquisition?\nJames Rasulo: Yes, there was revenue due to the consolidation of the Marvel acquisition. But there was an offset in sort of core underlying consumer product performance because of the increase in film share that gets recognized at the studio. But the fundamentals that consumer products were pretty much across-the-board. The licensing comparables were up, the Disney Store revenue has been up, and then Marvel, both the Marvel licensing business and the publishing business being included in the results, all accounted for the increase in overall CP. Needless to say, this is due to the strength of Toy Story 3 on the licensing side and largely on the Disney store side, though the comparables on our renovated stores are quite strong compared to what they were prior to renovation.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi with Standard & Poor's Equity Group.\nTuna Amobi - S&P Equity Research: I don't know if this sounds like a strategic question, Bob, but I wanted to get your take on, as you think about all these explosion of applications and interconnected devices, it seems like basically it's a battle between Apple and Android-enabled operating systems. So when you think about your strategy there and given obviously crucial position that Steve Jobs holds in the company, is it fair to say at this point, that you're kind of more inclined to go with the iOS operating system in terms of kind of the device interoperability that you're talking about here, or are you more like experimenting with pretty much everyone out there in terms of an open kind of platform? Some color there would be helpful.\nRobert Iger: I'm thinking of just saying yes. I am going to spend a fair amount of time next week talking about our digital media strategy overall, but I don't want to be dismissive of your question. There isn't one company, Apple or any other company for that matter, that's driving our strategy. What's driving the strategy is really the incredible developments we're seeing on the technology side that when added to great content and brands provide for more opportunity than we've ever seen before. And more opportunity for the consumer as well, not just to consume more media, but to do it in more places and with more convenience and access and navigation and interoperability. The decisions we're making in terms of what media that we distribute our product are made based on a variety of things. We want to be in a good place on a good platform, where there is good navigation and decent access to revenue. And our brand and our products are in effect showcased well and its reliable for the consumer. We want to be in places that we believe have growth potential so that the underlying technology or the underlying capital behind the effort is such that the platform's going to be around for a long time. And we're looking, both domestically and internationally, for opportunities to essentially create more competition among distributors. When you have great content, the more out there in terms of your ability to distribute that content to the consumer the better off you are. And then there's another factor or a couple of other factors that are important. One, piracy. There's no question that being available, well priced, well timed to the market is one of the best ways to combat piracy, and we have got to continue to be mindful of that, because the absence of being available in a world where there's great technology and great content can be very dangerous. And then I think it's also important for us to be relevant. When you're on these new platforms you just appear to be more relevant to the consumer, and I think that is both brand enhancing and business enhancing. So I don't know that I'm choosing iOS and Android and then getting into all those details. We might get into a little bit more detail with you next week but I'd be glad to discuss, and will discuss in much more detail our thoughts about what's going on in the marketplace in terms of digital media and changing consumer behavior and all the different opportunities that accompany like Disney, with brands, Disney/Pixar, Marvel, ESPN, ABC, all the opportunities that we're seeing. It's a pretty interesting time. And it's important to be out in front and to be experimental, because we haven't discovered yet the silver bullet or the business model that's going to prevail. It probably will be many.\nTuna Amobi - S&P Equity Research: So you rolled out authenticated ESPN, which seems like a groundbreaking milestone for you. And when you think about Disney Channel, for example, and is that something that could also be on the table for authentication, or is that pretty much hampered by the potential advertiser monetization for that particular channel? Or just kind of trying to get a sense of Disney Channel and others that could follow along the same lines?\nRobert Iger: We think we'll have opportunities to authenticate a number of our channels, the deal that we cut that was obviously the big one and one of the first was with Time Warner just for ESPN. We've been pretty vocal about the fact that the multi-channel or basic -- expanded basic cable service is of great value to the consumer, particularly when you consider substantially increased investment in original programming that's available in all those channels. So you're right now getting a lot more quality and a lot more choice, and we think it's a pretty good consumer proposition. If we can add to that authentication, which is giving the consumer the ability to watch that channel in more places as we did with ESPN so you can turn a laptop on in Los Angeles if you're a Time Warner customer or in New York and watch ESPN, that's a big deal. Because all you're doing is you're creating enhanced value for the package that's being offered and for the consumer and for the distributor. So we are extremely supportive of authentication, and believe that this is just the beginning of a trend that we'll be seeing, just not just for ESPN but for multiple Disney owned so-called cable television properties.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Miller with Caris & Company.\nDavid Miller - Caris & Company: Bob, could you detail the Toy Story 3 unit sell through number in the quarter? And then within that, could you just talk about the secular change, obviously, in DVD sell through as it applies to really all genres out there and has it forced you or Rich Ross and Rich Ross' team et cetera to rethink negative costs and to rethink how films are marketed?\nRobert Iger: I can't give you more detail in terms of sell through rates or number of units that were sold in the quarter for Toy Story 3. The overall home video marketplace for the industry has softened, continues to soften. We've been relatively well-positioned because of the strength of the brand, the nature of the titles that we put out and as we've said a number of times, the fact that we tend to make movies that people want to own so their kids can watch them multiple times. We also are library-ing, or managing our libraries very well, so that when we bring certain product out, we create events by bringing them out and defy logic, so to speak, in terms of the marketplace. So, look, Toy Story was a successful title internationally. Certainly the sell through rates, when you consider the conversion and the size of the box office substantially different than the marketplace we saw years back. Interestingly enough, what Toy Story 3 did was it increased sales of Toy Story 1 and 2, which we found very interesting. The library title that I thought was really interesting is we brought Beauty and the Beast back in Blu-ray in the fall, and that was extremely well-received. We bring these out as events and we package them very well at our stores and at retail with a variety of different consumer products, and that's been a winning proposition. We've also seen a fair amount of success with some of our direct-to-video titles. And interestingly enough over the last three, four years, they've been fairly steady in terms of performance, and we have not seen the erosion of those kind of titles that we've seen with some of the certainly, the live action titles. In terms of the overall impact of home video to the Movie business, we've been steadily reducing the number of Movie titles that we make in a year. We, as you know, are talking about well under 10 Disney-branded titles a year that will include certainly a Pixar title, and hopefully a Disney animation title per year. Add to that a couple of Marvel titles per year, and then we'll be distributing the DreamWorks titles. We like the level that we're talking about in terms of total investment, and we're going to look as part of that mix to make big blockbusters that have big budgets because not only we believe they work as movies, but they work as franchises for the company, and it's company wide or business wide events. Pirates is a great example of that. And we're also going to build into that mix relatively inexpensive titles, Disney-branded but much lower budget. I don't want to speak for the whole industry, but I think for our studio, and they know this well, it's extremely wise to take a very eyes-wide-open approach to the trends they're seeing in the marketplace and react accordingly in terms of expense. And then also react accordingly in terms of how the product is brought to marketplace in terms of pricing and windows and nature of the packages and the offering. And we'll get into that a lot more next week.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of John Janedis with UBS.\nJohn Janedis - UBS Investment Bank: You guys saw some really nice margin expansion in the Broadcasting segment. Given the lower ratings at ABC, how are you thinking about programming investment moving towards the upfront?\nJames Rasulo: Obviously, John, we've been talking a couple of quarters now about having our ratings supported by better programming on ABC. We've also been investing in ABC Family. And you all know, on the cable side, we're heavily investing in, XD, Disney Jr. and so on. I think that we continue to want to create and own great programming for the ABC Network. It is for us a platform to create content that can be utilized broadly across the spectrum. It's the first window of distribution for great product, and we want to follow our principles of great creative product leading the way for the company. So we will continue to invest in that. You saw in our release on the flip side, margins have been greatly improved by being more prudent on the cost side relative to news and daytime, and we continue to work both sides of that. But make no bones about it, we want to have great creative product out there and we're investing behind it.\nRobert Iger: We have someone new in the role of prime time -- head of prime time for ABC, Paul Lee. And he and I have talked a fair amount because he's in a job that I had many, many years ago. I advised him that in heading to the upfront in the middle of pilot season, that it's about making great shows, it's not about making a lot of them. Meaning, in development it's not about volume, it's about quality. And that doesn't mean you're looking to increase pricing or reduce pricing on what you make, but we ought to be making the right things and if he sees product that he feels is mediocre then don't make it. There's been a trend at times in the business to fill slots and to just to make a lot of pilots. I don't think that that's wise, particularly in a time that's really competitive for talent. It doesn't help when you water down the field. And I think he's being really disciplined. It's very early, but I like the product that he's developing, and we'll get a chance in May to see what he's made, and put a schedule together from there. But, it's important to make the right decisions and not just make a lot of product.\nLowell Singer: John, thanks. And thanks again, everyone, for joining us today.

My name is Ellen, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Singer, you may begin.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thank you, Ellen, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Walt Disney Company's Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued about 45 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast, and we will post the webcast and a transcript of the call to our website later. Joining me in Burbank for today\u2019s call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob will lead off, and Jay will make some comments, and then of course, we'll be happy to take your questions. So with that, I'll turn it over to Bob, and we'll get started.\nRobert A. Iger: Thank you, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very happy to report that Disney has delivered yet another record annual performance, driven by improved results in each of our businesses. In the fiscal 2012 year, Disney achieved record revenue, net income and earnings per share. Net income was up by 18% for the year on a 3% increase in revenue, and our earnings per share adjusted for comparability were up 21% over last year. I'm also very pleased with our fourth quarter results, which were primarily driven by growth at Cable Networks and Parks and Resorts. Net income grew by 14%, and revenue was up 3% for the quarter. And our EPS for Q4 adjusted for comparability grew 15% to $0.68. These results once again demonstrate our ability to grow earnings in the near term while investing for the long term, and we're obviously proud of our performance. Before I get into the highlights of fiscal 2012, I just want to mention the tremendous creative resurgence we are seeing at Disney Animation. Building on the success of Tangled, our newest release, Wreck-It Ralph, just had a phenomenal opening weekend, bigger than any previous Disney animated movie. With $58.6 million in domestic box office so far, Wreck-It Ralph continues the creative momentum that started with our acquisition of Pixar. Pixar deal brought us more than just great Pixar movies. It also reinvigorated our entire animation pipeline led by the great team of John Lasseter and Ed Catmull. Looking back, fiscal 2012 was a great year for Disney by every measure: creatively, financially and strategically. Marvel had a fantastic year, capped by the extraordinary success of The Avengers, which became the world's third highest grossing movie of all time, a global phenomenon and an incredibly important franchise for us. Pixar also generated a great deal of value for us this year from the opening of the phenomenal Cars Land to transform Disney California Adventure into an extraordinary park, to the opening of BRAVE, which became Pixar's 13th consecutive movie to debut #1 at the box office. We opened 2 new lands in Hong Kong Disneyland, completed the first phase of our historic multiyear expansion of Fantasyland in Walt Disney World and made significant progress in Shanghai to keep development on track to open by the end of 2015. With the addition of the Disney Fantasy last March, we've now more than doubled our cruise business, and this year, we were named the #1 large cruise line by readers of Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler magazine. ESPN was a strong contributor for the year as well, adding Wimbledon to its world-class sports lineup, along with higher ratings, ad sales and affiliate revenue. ESPN also solidified its position in some critical sports, including college football and basketball and major league baseball. Disney Channels worldwide continued to be an important brand and business driver for our company, reaching approximately 425 million homes in 167 countries. In 2002, we introduced Disney Junior and Disney XD to new markets around the world and also launched our first over-the-air Disney Channel in Russia. We also completed our strategic acquisition of UTV, making Disney India's leading -- making Disney India's leading film studio and TV producer, as well as one of the country's leading broadcasters, reaching more than 100 million viewers every week. And looking ahead, our Shanghai development is moving into an exciting phase as the construction work starts to define the shape of things to come and our vision starts to become reality. We look forward to completing our Hong Kong Disneyland expansion, which should only enhance the park's current strong performance. And we're also very excited about the ongoing Fantasyland transformation at Walt Disney World. It's the largest expansion of the Magic Kingdom since that park opened more than 40 years ago, and it's going to be pretty spectacular. And also in Florida, we're very excited about a new technology rollout designed to enhance guest experience and advance and expand guest engagement before their visits. We will provide details early next year, but among the many features and benefits of this technology is giving guests the chance to plan their itineraries ahead of time, including access to their favorite and often our most popular attractions. On the studio front, we're going to follow the success of Wreck-It Ralph with 4 major films this fiscal year: Oz The Great and Powerful opens on March 8, and Marvel's Iron Man 3 will be in theaters May 3. And this coming summer, Pixar's Monsters University will open on June 21, followed by The Lone Ranger on July 3. As all of you know, last week, we announced our acquisition of Lucasfilm. And upon closing, we believe it will fit right in with Disney, ABC, ESPN, Pixar and Marvel in our unparalleled portfolio of phenomenal assets and world-class brands. And when you look at all the franchises and IP ever created in the history of entertainment and rank them in terms of value, Star Wars is always at or near the very top of that list. It is the very definition of a franchise. It has global appeal, stands the test of time, 35 years so far, and we see great potential well into the future. It enjoys strong unwavering popularity with hundreds of millions of fans even in the absence of a new theatrical release in the last 7 years. Star Wars is an incredibly relevant and vibrant franchise, with tremendous opportunity for global growth, especially with the new slate of feature films starting with Star Wars Episode 7 in 2015. The addition of Lucasfilm to our strong portfolio of assets will continue to fuel Disney's creative engine across our entire company to create additional value for our shareholders. We're obviously very pleased with what we've achieved in fiscal 2012, and overall, we believe we're well positioned for continued strong performance and growth. I'm now going to turn the call over to Jay Rasulo to go through the details. Jay?\nJames A. Rasulo: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased with our fourth quarter results, ending yet another record year of financial performance for the company. We reported record revenue, net income and earnings per share in fiscal 2012, surpassing last year's record results. Our performance is the result of relentless focus on maximizing the value of our existing assets and realizing returns from recent investments while continuing to invest for future growth. We believe this balanced approach will deliver consistent and attractive returns for our shareholders for years to come. I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing the fourth quarter in more detail, and then I'll bring -- I'll highlight a few 2013 items. In Q4, Media Networks was the largest contributor to our performance, driven by growth in operating income at Cable Networks due to continued growth at ESPN and higher equity income at A&E Television Networks. Growth at ESPN was due to an increase in affiliate revenue, which was driven by higher rates, partially offset by higher programming costs for college football and Major League Baseball, as well as our new Wimbledon contract. Higher equity income at A&E Television Networks during the quarter resulted from increases in advertising and affiliate revenue. Advertising revenue at ESPN was flat for the quarter as higher rates were offset by lower ratings. We experienced a less robust marketplace around the Olympics, and we did not see as strong a pickup in demand as we expected after the Olympics ended. During the quarter, ESPN signed a new long-term agreement with Major League Baseball. This deal extends our rights through 2021 season and significantly enhances our current deal with more games, greater coexist rights and an increase in annual studio programming hours of more than 100%. Extending our partnership with Major League Baseball further strengthens our unrivaled sports content portfolio, which continues to make ESPN the #1 destination for sports fans, as well as cable television's most valuable network. Operating income at Broadcasting was down modestly compared to last year due to lower advertising revenue at the ABC Network partially offset by higher program sales. Lower advertising revenue at the network was driven by lower primetime ratings. Higher program sales were driven by the sale of Castle and Wipeout in the quarter. At the ABC Network, quarter-to-date scatter pricing is pacing mid-teens above upfront levels. ESPN ad sales are pacing down modestly, and ABC Family ad sales are pacing up high single digits. TV station ad sales are pacing up mid single digits as well. Our Parks and Resorts segment delivered solid results, with revenue up 9% and operating income up 18%. The increase in operating income was due to higher results at our international resorts and Disney Cruise Line. Total segment margins were up 100 basis points compared to last year. Growth initiatives reduced segment margin expansion by about 90 basis points. Results at our international resorts were high due to increased attendance at Hong Kong Disneyland and Disneyland Paris. Royalties from the Tokyo Disney Resort were also higher versus prior year quarter. Higher operating income at Disney Cruise Line was driven by the increased passenger cruise days due to the launch of the Disney Fantasy. Results at our domestic parks were comparable to prior year as growth at the Disneyland Resort was largely offset by higher costs at Walt Disney World as a result of our growth initiatives. We are encouraged by Disneyland Resorts' overall performance in the quarter and are particularly pleased with its attendance and per capita spending results following the opening of Cars Land in June. Overall, domestic attendance was up 3% driven by strong attendance at the Disneyland Resort. Per capita spending at our domestic parks was up 7% on higher ticket prices and food and beverage spending. Average per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 8%. The increase in per room spending was driven by higher pricing and higher merchandise spending. Occupancy at our domestic hotels was down 3 percentage points to 78% due to an increase in available rooms at Walt Disney World. The increase in available room nights was driven by the completion of the final phase of Disney's Art of Animation Hotel. So far this quarter, domestic hotel reservations are pacing up mid single digits compared to prior year levels, while book rates are also up. At Studio Entertainment, the decrease in operating income was driven by lower worldwide theatrical results and higher film cost write-downs, which were partially offset by stronger performance of our worldwide home entertainment business. Worldwide theatrical results were lower due to the strong performance of Cars 2 and Lion King 3D last year compared to BRAVE and Finding Nemo 3D, as well as higher pre-released marketing expenses compared to prior year. Worldwide home entertainment results were up due to higher unit sales and increased effective pricing driven by the successful release of Marvel's The Avengers. At Consumer Products, operating income was up in the quarter due to higher results in merchandise licensing and retail. Growth in licensing was driven by higher earned royalties due to the strong performance of Spiderman and The Avengers merchandise. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up 5%. Higher retail operating income was primarily driven by strong results in North America and Europe. At the Interactive segment, lower operating losses compared to prior year were due to continued improvement in our social games business, which benefited from lower impact to purchase accounting. Results in our console game business faced a difficult comparison to the performance of Cars 2 and Pirates LEGO in the prior year, with no comparable titles in the quarter this year. I would now like to turn to fiscal 2013. Overall, we feel great about our prospects for this fiscal year, but I would like to discuss a few timing and comparability issues, particularly related to Q1, and provide some insight into a few cost considerations for 2013. At Cable, domestic sports rights costs will be $170 million higher in Q1 versus last year driven by increases in college football, NFL and NBA programming. College football increase is due to our new deals with the Pac-12 and the Big 12, along with the expansion of the SEC. Our Q1 NBA costs will be higher compared to last year when fewer games were played in Q1 due to the lockout. However, ESPN's full year results will reflect the benefit of several new affiliate deals, one of which will commence in the second quarter. At Studio, we face a very difficult home entertainment comparison in Q1 given strong operating income from Cars 2 and the Lion King last year. Specifically, we expect this comparison to drive a year-over-year decline in home entertainment operating income of more than $150 million. Cars 2 delivered very strong home entertainment operating income last year, driven in part by lower cost allocations given to the strength -- given the strength of its merchandise licensing revenue. The strong performance of the Lion King was volume driven as the title had not been available on home video since January 2005. Our Q1 Parks and Resorts results will be impacted by a timing shift due to our fiscal calendar as a portion of the New Year's holiday will shift from fiscal Q1 to fiscal Q2. We estimate this will shift about $30 million in operating income from Q1 to Q2. 2013 will benefit from a full year of performance from both the Disney Fantasy and Disney California Adventure. We expect these 2 projects to be accretive to operating income. However, the gains will be offset this year by incremental spending for projects in Orlando and Shanghai. In Orlando, we're continuing to work on the guest experience enhancement project Bob discussed. In Shanghai, we're beginning to ramp up spending for our new theme park. So in fiscal 2013, in aggregate, all of our growth initiatives, both launched and to be launched, will contribute roughly $500 million of both incremental revenue and expense. We expect these initiatives to be accretive to operating income in fiscal 2014 and increasingly add to operating income each year thereafter and each to deliver returns above our cost of capital. We expect the Q1 tax rate to be about 2 percentage points higher than last year due to the benefit of tax settlements in prior year. Pension and postretirement medical expenses will increase by approximately $70 million in fiscal 2013 due to a decline in discount rate. On top of these items, we do expect Superstorm Sandy to impact our Q1 results, though it's a little too early to quantify that. This list of comparability and one-time items that I've just shared with you will impact our Q1 reported earnings. But rest assured, we remain confident that our operating performance for the remaining quarters will result in solid earnings growth for the entire 2013 fiscal year. We continued to repurchase our stock during the fourth quarter with 19.1 million shares repurchased for about $973 million. For the fiscal year, we repurchased 72 million shares for $3 billion. So far this quarter, we have repurchased 8.2 million shares for $419 million. Over the next 2 quarters, we expect to repurchase in the open market up to 40 million shares in connection with the Lucasfilm acquisition, and that's in addition to our regular share repurchase. 2012 was another great year for our company, and in 2013, we expect to deliver another year of strong operating performance. Now I'll turn the call over to Lowell for questions.\nLowell Singer: Okay, Jay, thanks. Operator, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Michael Nathanson from Nomura.\nMichael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: I have a couple of quick housekeeping questions for Jay, then one for Bob. Jay, can you just give us a sense of where [indiscernible] growth was for this year for Cable Networks?\nJames A. Rasulo: Yes, sure. The full year adjusted cable revenue was high mid-single digits. This is just for some -- high single digits, yes. Isn't that what I said? I'm sorry. This adjusts for unfavorable FX impact and also for the impact of Leap Day, which I don't want to get into in great detail. But it affects our revenue for the year, and reported cable affiliate revenue mid single digits.\nMichael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Okay. And then, Bob, you've been around broadcast networks for a long time. And it would just seem to make sense to ask you this question. What do you think is happening to the start of this season? Everyone's worried about broadcast over the years. Is this decline in kind of the ratings something that you think is going to be fixed over the course of the season or are you more worried than that?\nRobert A. Iger: Well, I think the story of the year, really 2 things. One, the greater penetration of DVRs and the greater usage of DVRs, which clearly have shifted the rating in the direction of C3 and ultimately, hopefully C7 because I think it speaks for an expanded look from a Nielsen and advertising perspective at 7 days versus 3. And I think the other story is that there seems to be somewhat of an absence of what I call new big real sort of buzzworthy hits. And because of that, I would say that it would be premature to either write the epitaph or suggest that we're seeing a trend. We've seen years where the presence of a big hit -- by the way, as in the case with NBC, if you look at the impact of The Voice on their schedule, it has improved their numbers dramatically. So I think I'm happy to believe that ABC's schedule is pretty solid. Their Sunday schedule with Once Upon a Time and Revenge is working, and they've got Modern Family and Grey's, and others show some real strong base. And their ratings from a C3 perspective without sports are down in the 7% to 8% range, which I don't consider to be that noteworthy. What I'd like to -- would I have liked ABC to have put on the schedule a really big hit at the beginning of the year? Of course. But they put on a few shows that are I think quite serviceable and have potential, Nashville being one.\nJames A. Rasulo: Okay, Mike. Before we go to the next question, this is Jay, Lowell just handed me a note that I misspoke on the share repurchase. I think I said that we'd buy back the 40 million shares issued for the Lucasfilm acquisition in the next 2 quarters. I misspoke. I meant the next years 2 years, which we stated previously. Sorry, Lowell.\nOperator: The next question is from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just on the domestic park business. You highlighted growth initiative [ph] turning profits in the quarter, and it sounds like they'll continue into fiscal '13. Just want to clarify that any significant margin expansion toward your historic levels, we should now assume will happen more likely in 2014. And then staying with the Parks, I think you mentioned Disneyland drove the good growth in attendance in the quarter. Can you talk about attendance trends at Disney World?\nRobert A. Iger: Alexia, thank you. So relative to the new initiatives and the ultimate impact, I said that they will affect, of course, the rest of fiscal 2013 and begin to be accretive in 2014. I don't want to be -- I don't want to give too much guidance on where that takes us from a margin perspective. I -- we have said for some period of time that there is no reason structurally, including, by the way, what I just said about these new initiatives that will ultimately keep us from reaching our prerecession margin levels at the Parks. So I think that is your -- I hope that answers your question. On the attendance trends on the 2 coasts, obviously, the great success of Cars Land both from a quality and from a quantity perspective in terms of attendance and pricing has reflected itself in Disneyland Resort, greatly outgrowing Walt Disney World. I'll say that Walt Disney World's attendance was down modestly, but Disneyland's attendance was up substantially, resulting, if you add the 2 together, in domestic attendance being up 3% that I mentioned.\nJames A. Rasulo: We also feel good about the expected attendance at Disney World for the year. We have seen some pretty decent Christmas bookings, although there's a quirk in the calendar in terms of when Christmas hits. So if you look at over 3-week period, it's the 2 later weeks of that 3-week period that are the strong weeks because Christmas is on a Tuesday. And that does bleed into what would be our next fiscal quarter, not our -- which is our second, not our first. But the bookings are strong. We also feel really good about Fantasyland rolling out. It is, as I mentioned, the first big improvement that we've done at the Magic Kingdom in about 40 years. The product is already, in some cases, open and doing really well, and we think that's going to drive some attendance gains at that park. And then lastly, we opened a big new hotel, Art of Animation, which features a family suite concept, which is growing in popularity in the marketplace, and the bookings for that hotel have been great.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And we saw -- recently, I saw some reports that Hong Kong reached profitability for the first time. Have you really turned the corner there? And given the success, are you likely to build out even maybe further than what you originally planned?\nJames A. Rasulo: We're seeing really strong trends, and we believe we have turned the corner there. If you just look at the attendance patterns, particularly from the mainland, for instance, we expanded with 3 worlds. 2 of the 3 are open, including a Toy Story Land, and that's doing -- they're all doing quite well. And the third one is going to open sometime this spring. So we feel really good about the trends at Hong Kong Disneyland. We always said that we were going to expand. We have the land to do so, and we have projects that are in varying stages of development, but we have nothing to announce at this point about that.\nOperator: The next question is from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I guess a couple of Parks questions. Jay, I don't know if you want to give us the domestic, international parks splits for the quarter. I think we have to wait for the 10-K usually for that, but I thought I'd ask anyway.\nJames A. Rasulo: Yes, I'll tell you that I've talked for a long time about that range being like 18% to 22%, 23%. And in this quarter at World, they were up at the high end of that range. We had a very strong fourth quarter relative to international attendance, fundamentally driven by Brazil and Argentina. But even the U.K., which is, of course, one of our other big markets, was up for the fourth quarter.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then just staying on the parks, you mentioned in the release and on your remarks that operating income at the domestic Parks and Resorts, so ex Cruise, was basically flat year-over-year. Was there anything unusual on the expense side? Because it seems, based on the numbers you gave us, that revenue growth was pretty solid. So I just wanted to come back to that point.\nJames A. Rasulo: Yes, Ben. Bob mentioned in his comments, these enhancements that we are doing to -- what I would say is really the essence of a visit to Walt Disney World, starting all the way back with planning, pre-reserving up through your experience at the Park with the use of technology and the use of a bunch of enhanced services to make guests visit more efficient and enjoyable while they're there. And we will start to see revenue inure to us from that. But we're -- like many things, just before you start, there are costs. And those costs in fact, have had -- are offsetting the revenue increases that are implied by our attendance and per capita spending increases in terms of the quarter.\nRobert A. Iger: Also, because we're in a testing phase to make sure the technology is working the way we both expect and need it to work, we've been hesitant to roll out more details to all of you and to the public for that matter. There's been a fair amount of chatter about the features of this technological advancement or investment. But we've been hesitant to give details until we're ready to really basically make it -- before it's ready for prime time, so to speak. Ben, we're getting close.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And maybe I could just ask one more, Bob, or either to -- to either of you about the sort of list of items you named for us to think about in '13, it's -- as we furiously write them down and try to digest them. I'm trying to understand if you think this is a year, 2013, that's sort of an investment year for the company on the operating side or where growth is going to be kind of below the historical average we're used to seeing from Disney. Or if these are -- it seems like every year there are things going on at the company where you're investing, but you seem to pump out 15% to 20% earnings growth every year. Any way to kind of put a bow on this for us? These things to think about?\nJames A. Rasulo: Yes, well, let me start by emphasizing, Ben, that almost everything that I did check through, we see as primarily a Q1 impact, not primarily as an overall fiscal 2013 impact. And we are still very confident that this will be a strong year for us in terms of performance. The -- obviously, the comparability, just to go through it, the large items, the one we just talked about in terms of costs associated with these guest enhancements before the revenue comes in. Secondly, the home video comparison, where we'll be off pretty substantially on a comparability basis there because if you think about Cars 2, which was not only a successful video title but because of all of the merchandise success in prior periods around that title, that bleeds off a lot of the amortization that goes with the making of that film. When you -- because consumer product sales are part of the ultimate package in which the film is amortized against. So a lot of that was bled off in prior periods, which made that a particularly profitable title a year ago in the home video front. BRAVE was also a profitable title, but it doesn't have the benefit of bleeding off all of that amortization when the units sell. So that has created a very tough comparison. And then I mentioned the Lion King versus Finding Nemo through -- in terms of its release, where the Lion King had been kind of in the vault since 2005 and, of course, had enormous response in the marketplace due to that. Nemo was more available on a regular basis in the market and therefore didn't benefit from that bump. So those 2 factors are about $150 million, but that's a first quarter event. And that is not -- that doesn't affect our performance at the studio in the rest of the 3 quarters of the year. The tax number I ticked off again is -- has to do with a tax favorability in the prior year. It's a first quarter event as well, of course, because taxes tend to -- you tend to carry that for the whole year. We'll have a little bit up in our tax -- our effective tax rate for the year but not as much as in the first quarter. So I tried to emphasize, and it's always difficult, in prepared remarks to kind of emphasize that these are really largely comparability items that we're trying to give you info on in the first quarter and are not to lead you to believe we don't have confidence in strong results for the whole year.\nRobert A. Iger: Ben, as Jay suggested, we're not going to give you specific guidance for the year. But since you asked us to characterize or categorize the year, I'd say that we are entering a phase of transitioning out of an investment mode and transitioning into a more compelling growth mode. But it is a -- again, it is a transition year in that regard because of some of the things that Jay talked about. And that's also reflected in the rampdown of capital spending.\nOperator: The next question is from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I was just wondering if you could address your boys -- the initiative -- your boys initiative. I'm not sure how to phrase that. I mean, given the Star Wars acquisition, your Marvel acquisition, it seems like you really have a completely different product to offer boys, and historically, the focus maybe has been more girls. So can you talk about how you're viewing that as a category and what you can do to address that? I mean, you are addressing it, but what's the opportunity?\nRobert A. Iger: Well, I think the opportunity is pretty broad in terms of what it will ultimately present to the company. I could start with our theme parks. While we haven't really had a gender problem at our theme parks, we've always been mindful of what we're offering is something for everybody. And as some of the IP gravitated more in the girls' direction, it made us turn to some other IP that maybe wasn't derived from movies or television series, for instance, in order to essentially deliver against the -- basically, the interest of our guests. Obviously, we've had Star Wars in the past. This gives us the ability to expand that presence in our parks. Marvel, in certain circumstances, because you may recall there are some encumbrances there, will give us an opportunity to expand, but -- that mostly internationally. So that's one way. Obviously, on the TV front, we launched or we relaunched a channel a few years back called Disney XD, which had other names in its past. If Disney Channel is focused a little bit more on girls than boys, this is going to be focused a little bit more on boys than girls. We started to roll out Marvel shows there. We referenced in our comments about the Lucasfilm acquisition if there are opportunities for television. One big opportunity for us in Lucasfilm's derived IP is on that channel. Again, it gives the ability to fulfill promise of that channel that much quicker. The footprint from Consumer Products obviously will give us much more of a blend. That enhances our relationship in the marketplace with retailers and with licensees as a for instance and just generally broadens the profile of the brand. Lucas product, by the way, will be co-branded with Disney's name on it. And then, of course, on the games front, we also have that ability to turn more to Disney IP, particularly since games are a little bit more boys-driven anyway. And so I don't want to -- we'll proceed with caution in this direction, but I think it enhances our opportunity particularly in the mobile space, which is very driven by boys.\nJessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Great. And then I guess just I heard you on CNBC, but I was just wondering. So you stated on CNBC today that there probably are not big acquisitions or acquisitions of this size. Can you just give us your thoughts, are you -- do you feel like you're strategically complete, or what other areas would you look at even if they are smaller?\nRobert A. Iger: Actually, we felt we were relatively strategically complete in the past. The Lucasfilm acquisition, even though I just responded to your question about boys in a manner that would suggest we might not have felt strategically complete from a gender perspective. Imagine talking about being strategically complete from a gender perspective. I think I should be shot for that. But we don't necessarily make acquisitions to fill in strategic holes, and we didn't in the Lucas case. That was an opportunity to buy IP that, as I described, is unparalleled really in terms of its value, the strength of its franchise and the potential that it represents particularly or especially to a company like ours. And we're not looking right now at anything from an acquisition perspective that is in any way tied to something that we would consider a strategic hole.\nOperator: The next question is from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein.\nTodd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I have 2 questions, if I may, one on TV and one on consumer. From the TV side -- on the TV side, there is a comment in the release about the Disney Channels having a significant program sale in the prior year. I just wondered if you could confirm -- I think that might have been the Netflix or the Amazon deals, and I wanted to confirm that. And whether it was or wasn't, would love to hear just an update on how you're feeling about those services and the role of them in your platform. And then the question on the Consumer Products side. Just given all the increased breadths of your franchises with Marvel and now Lucasfilm, wondering if that changes the way you think about your retail strategy at all in terms of the aggressiveness about which you might think about opening more store locations or what the store concepts might be or square footage. Any comments on that will be much appreciated.\nRobert A. Iger: Okay, the second part of your question, the impact of the Lucasfilm acquisition on our store strategy. It will not change our store strategy. We've approached that, I guess, with some degree of caution because of the obvious risks associated with being a specialty retail bricks-and-mortar business, so it's not going to change our footprint. It will change our SKU makeup at the stores is a great opportunity as we saw with Marvel to infuse our stores with Star Wars merchandise, for instance, and we look forward to doing that. And also to grow our online retail or our e-commerce business, which, by the way, has grown very, very nicely since the relaunch of disney.com. And noticing -- what we've noticed in terms of sale of Lucasfilm merchandise online, we think there's real potential there. To the first question, we were not specific about the deal that we referenced that was impacted, I guess, the fourth quarter a year ago, and we won't be specific. You're pretty good at guessing, but I'll leave it at that. We feel very, very good about opportunities in SVOD and on digital platforms, as we've seen and other large media companies have seen the opportunities to monetize owned IP are only growing not just because of new technology but globally. And I think you'll continue to see growth in both revenue and growth in bottom line, in income, from output deals to these third party or new platform owners. An exciting time for intellectual property owners.\nTodd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. And just your content is still on Netflix, I think a lot of Disney Channel content is still in there. So regardless of the timing of specifics, it seems like you're still in business with them clearly today and it sounds like you intend to be?\nRobert A. Iger: We're in business with Netflix, we're in business with others, and we'll probably continue to be in business with those and new entrants in the marketplace. And we are engaged in discussions in a number of directions about that.\nOperator: The next question is from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.\nDouglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: You probably started to address this, but if I sort of think back a decade ago, you're always brand-focused, right? And you were running the brand committee. And there was an appeal elegance to having 2 umbrella brands, Disney and ESPN, and having the focus on those 2 brands seem to be an advantage. And now you spread out with so many brands with Pixar and Marvel and Star Wars and now ABC, as you mentioned pretty consistently. Is -- one, was there an underlying strategy to diversify or expand your brand portfolio beyond those sort of 2 initial core brands? And then what gives you comfort that you can successfully manage this many brands when again, in the past, it seems like focusing on just 2 umbrella brands was thought of as an advantage.\nRobert A. Iger: Well, 7 years after the Pixar acquisition or, I guess, technically it's 6 -- sorry, 6.5 years, I think there's ample proof that, that brand has been managed very effectively. And during the period of time that we've owned Pixar, the equity in the Disney brand, no matter how you measure it, has also increased. So I think we've demonstrated our ability to be ambidextrous in that regard. We also co-brand Pixar films with Disney. And we found in the process that, that enhances both impression of the Pixar brand and impression of the Disney brand. Marvel has seen, I think, real strong brand growth. That's largely been tied to a couple of things. One, quality of their films, particularly the last 3: Captain America, Thor and obviously Avengers. But also, and the growth of their -- the presence of the brand, which is in part enhanced by self-distribution. So when we take over the distribution of their films, for instance, and we are also the owner of the brand, we're much more focused on growing the brand in the process than the third-party distributors that distributed their product before were interested in. So there are opportunities there. The Star Wars brand, I think, basically doesn't need much help except to, obviously, will I think benefit greatly from the release of a film. We intend in that case to co-brand, as I mentioned just a few minutes ago, Disney-Lucas or Disney-Star Wars in some form, different forms. And I think that's again another opportunity like Pixar to enhance both the Star Wars brand and the Disney brand. ESPN's doing just fine. ABC is also doing fine, although from a brand perspective, we leveraged the ABC name obviously in much more limited fashion than we do the other brands that we've been talking about.\nDouglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And if -- Lowell, let me ask one for Jay just a quick one. I want to take a shot at the Parks margin a different way. Would you say that the growth initiatives you've been nice enough to give us the revenue and OpEx impact for each of the past 3 years, would you say those will prove margin-accretive to the park division in time or in line or margin dilutive? So not from today but in aggregate, will those growth initiatives be margin accretive or dilutive to the parks?\nJames A. Rasulo: Yes, margin accretive, Doug. We are very confident that if you -- if I tick through the list quickly, the cruise ships, the enhancement of DCA, the Magic Kingdom expansion, Aulani Hotel and this new guest enhancement at Walt Disney World that we were talking about, every single one of those was done with a strategic and -- a pretty tight strategic and financial goal, and they will be in aggregate accretive as well someday, Shanghai, I didn't put that on the list because it's much longer-term than the rest of those things. But we think that all of these projects will be accretive to the ultimate margins of the business.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi.\nJason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just had a clarifying question for Mr. Rasulo. Going back to those, the park investments that you've talked about, were you saying -- I think you said -- I wasn't sure if you were saying you're going to invest $500 million in all of these initiatives next year or you're saying all of the growth initiatives that you've done historically will generate $500 million of revenue at a certain margin and whatever sort of incremental EBIT that generates will be investing that much in these improvements?\nJames A. Rasulo: Okay. What I said was a little bit of all the things that you said. So let's start at the top. In aggregate, they will generate $500 million of revenue. Some of those -- incremental revenue above our base business. Some of those that have been up and running for a while, like the cruise ship and DCA, will, in fact, generate -- will be accretive to earnings. They will generate operating -- positive operating income in the year. The guest enhancement project that Bob talked about and Shanghai Disneyland are still in the investment -- not the investment, in the sort of generating operating income -- there is investment, but generating operating expense that exceeds any revenue that they will generate. So if you look at all these things in aggregate, the Disney Cruise Line expansion, the Fantasyland expansion, Disney's California, the guest enhancement program that we're talking about and Shanghai Disneyland, in aggregate, their incremental expenses will match the aggregate incremental revenue. So they will generate $500 million of incremental revenue and $500 million of incremental expense.\nOperator: The next question is from Anthony DiClemente from Barclays.\nAnthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I don't think anyone's asked about advertising pacings at ESPN, and I guess I think you said in your remarks that they were pacing down, which is a little surprising to me for a couple of reasons. First, I think -- I remember you guys had a bullish tone about ESPN moving forward on the last call. So I'm wondering what really changed during the quarter? And then secondly, just wondering does that ad pacings being down include the return of the new NBA games? Or is that normalized for the impact or normalized for the benefit of the return of the new NBA games?\nJames A. Rasulo: So let me start out at the top, and maybe Bob will want to jump in. Starting at the top, we did say that the pacings were down modestly for ESPN. And some of that has to do, needless to say, with distraction from the elections, what that implies on ratings, debates, the things that basically attract interest that are extraordinary, and sporting events are sometimes consequently have lower ratings. But your question about the NBA, I'm sorry, can you repeat it?\nAnthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Well, the question is really for the 1Q, you talked about on the cost side sports rights fees going up by $170 million. And then just trying to think about that in terms of revenue as well. And if -- one of the reasons that the cost side is going up, you said, is because of more NBA games so -- are ad pacings going down despite the favorable year-over-year comp, despite having NBA games where you had the lockout last year?\nJames A. Rasulo: Yes, Anthony, yes.\nAnthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then I just have a quick follow-up, which is I never -- I didn't think that Hulu was a big driver of broadcasting. But since you've mentioned it in the press release, just wondering where -- what was going on with the higher equity losses at Hulu in the quarter. Just wonder if you could comment on that, how should we think about that?\nJames A. Rasulo: Yes, it's not a big effect. It did make it because we ranked the impacts from largest to smallest, and at some point, we cut them off. I would say this one, we usually like to put 2 or 3. This one made it, in other quarters probably wouldn't. But it's basically increased programming costs. It's above -- if you -- yes, if you back Hulu out of the broadcasting numbers, in fact, broadcasting would've been slightly positive. It turned out to be slightly negative because of it. I want to emphasize it's not a real driver for the quarter.\nOperator: The next question is from David Miller from Caris & Company.\nDavid W. Miller - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: I have one for Jay, one for Bob. Jay, you mentioned in the press release something about a film write-down under the Studio line. Could you just detail what you wrote down in the quarter? And I apologize in advance if it was already in your prepared remarks. I had some technical difficulty on the call. And then, Bob, on the Lucas deal or on the ensuing conference call last week vis-a-vis the Lucas deal, there were some confusion after the call, particularly out of the buy side, about any legacy agreement with 20th Century Fox that Lucasfilm has currently and what you have to pay out, if anything, to extract yourselves out of that.\nJames A. Rasulo: David, let me take the short answer. I think I mentioned at a conference and it was broadly reported that the write-down was for a film that was in progress in stop-action animation called Cinderbiter, and that was the vast majority, 98% of the write-downs for the quarter.\nRobert A. Iger: On Lucas, what we were referring to is the fact that Fox has certain distribution rights to films that have already been made and released and will be released in varying forms going forward as they did recently with the 3D release of one of the Star Wars films. In valuing Lucas going forward, we did not factor in any need on our part whatsoever to acquire any rights back from News Corp. We may choose at some point after closing to explore that, but all the value they were looking at is going forward value associated with all the rights that we bought from Lucas and any new IP that is created, which is not encumbered by any of the deals that Fox had.\nDavid W. Miller - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then, Jay, on the Hurricane Sandy impact, you said you couldn't really quantify it as of yet. But would the majority of that impact, whatever it is, be due to disruption at the parks just because folks in the tri-state area couldn't fly down to Orlando, obviously, may still not be able to fly down there? Or is it more of a make-good situation at the -- at any of the networks or is it a combination of both? What's sort of the majority effect, if you don't mind me asking?\nJames A. Rasulo: Not at all. Let me just tick off a list of things that we're looking at. Obviously, due to the hurricane, there are a number of Disney stores in the Atlantic area that were closed. I think we closed over 40 stores for a number of days. Secondly, when you don't have people with power and you don't have people watching television, you've obviously got some impact there on the broadcast side. On the Parks side, the Northeast is a good feeder market to Walt Disney World. We -- this is probably the toughest to quantify. In the past, I would tell you that we have found from natural disasters that people make their way back in the course of the year, so that could be a short-term impact. We have not seen a raft of cancellations, I would tell you that, that much we know so far.\nRobert A. Iger: Interestingly enough, this is a week that most of New Jersey schools are closed for the week. And that's as Jay referenced the important feeder market to Orlando, and obviously Jersey got devastated by the storm. We have seen very little impact this week. I talked to folks down in Orlando this morning, and it appears that the makeup of attendance at Disney World this week from New Jersey is just as strong as it usually is. So that's a pretty interesting sign.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Senno from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nMichael Senno - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just a couple of questions in regard to CapEx. You guys have mentioned that you expect it to ramp down in '13. Just in sizing that, should we attach some capital expenses to these enhancement projects in the incremental costs and investments that you've articulated for next year? And then also you mentioned this being the peak CapEx year. But looking ahead with the Shanghai consolidation, should we be expecting a reacceleration back up to these peak levels during that time?\nJames A. Rasulo: Yes, I'm happy to answer that. So let me just set the table. So we said that 2012 would be our peak CapEx year for some time to come, and that we would be ramping down significantly in Parks capital thereafter all -- while Shanghai was ramping up. So let me talk to that. If you look on the domestic side, we're -- domestic parks side, we're probably down -- will be down by -- at the end of fiscal '13 about $1 billion from where we were in fiscal '12 in terms of capital expenditures. A lot of the capital expenditure that is behind what Bob talked about as guest-enhancing technologies is behind us. On a consolidated basis, though, it's only going to look like a $500 million decrease. And in fact, the difference has to do with investment in Shanghai Disneyland. But remember, as only 43% owners of that project, we only spend 43% of the capital. So 57% of the capital spent on Shanghai Disneyland will make its way back to us in a financing line. So if you look at it that way, even on a consolidated basis, we're going to be down about $800 million for the year.\nMichael Senno - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. Is there any impact on the timing of that cash that's flowing back or is it pretty much in synchrony?\nJames A. Rasulo: I think there's paperwork that goes to it, but it's not like it's backloaded or it's a bullet payment. It's supposed to be contemporaneous with the expenditures.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vasily Karasyov from Susquehanna Financial.\nVasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Jay, I have a couple for you. One, you mentioned that ESPN has a couple of affiliate deals coming up in the year. You said one will be done by March. Can you please remind us what percentage of subs will be covered by that? And also on film, you highlighted the tough comp in the first quarter. But if you look at the remainder of the quarters, you have an easier comp with the John Carter write-down, and then you have The Avengers for the next 2 quarters. So when we try to estimate, is it going to be a up or down quarter -- or year, sorry, for the studio, what kind of put and takes should we keep in mind there?\nJames A. Rasulo: Okay, let me take your first question, which I've already forgotten, I'm afraid to say.\nVasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: The percentage of subs coming up.\nJames A. Rasulo: So what I've said in my comments -- I'm sorry, Vasily, what I've said in my comments was that we were going to see the kick-in from the revenue side of some new affiliate deals in the course of fiscal '13, one of which was going to be in the first quarter. That's not the renegotiation of that deal, but that is, in fact, the realization of the revenue from the negotiation of a prior deal. I don't want -- we've kind of made a habit of not getting into the details about the timing of our affiliate deals with our partners for all the right reasons of confidentiality and not wanting to get in the way of negotiation. So I'm sorry, I won't be any more articulate about that.\nRobert A. Iger: And as to your question about the comps and our film slate, obviously, we'll have tough Q3 comparisons because of Avengers. But we feel good overall about the slate in the year. Oz The Great and Powerful in March, Iron Man 3, Lone Ranger and, of course, Monsters University. So we think we've got a strong film slate coming up.\nLowell Singer: Vasily, thank you. And thanks again, everyone, for joining us today.

My name is Ann and I'll be your coordinator for today\u2019s call. As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session following the presentation. I\u2019d now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed sir.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Walt Disney Company\u2019s third quarter 2012 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 45 minutes ago; it's now available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. A webcast and a transcript of today\u2019s call will also be available on our website later today. Joining me in Burbank for today\u2019s call are Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob will lead off, followed by Jay, and then of course we will be happy to take your questions. So with that, I will turn it over to Bob.\nBob Iger: Thank you, Lowell, and good afternoon. We had a phenomenal third quarter delivering the largest quarterly earnings in the history of our company. Earnings per share were up 31% over the last year driven by growth in every one of our businesses. We also delivered record earnings per share for the first nine months of our fiscal year and we believe that our results clearly demonstrate Disney\u2019s unique value proposition and great potential to deliver long-term growth. Before Jay gets into the specifics about our quarter, I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes talking about the status of our capital spending in our parks and resorts as well as some of the acquisitions we made in the last few years especially Marvel. These things are relevant to our Q3 results and we will factor into our future performance as well. As you know, we\u2019ve made significant investments in our parks and resorts over the past several years to create an even greater Disney experience for our guests and to drive long-term goals. These include completely transforming Disney California Adventure, expanding Disney\u2019s fleet of cruise ships and enhancing and increasing the size of Fantasyland at Walt Disney World. California Adventure is now an exceptional park in its own right and the perfect neighbor to Disneyland. Since the June opening of the phenomenal Cars Land and the brand new Main Street, attended has been up along with guest satisfaction. In fact, Disneyland Resort had new Q3 attendance record and on most days since our reopening California Adventure has been drawing nearly 50% of the total attendance to the overall Disneyland Resort and that\u2019s up from roughly 25% in the past. The successful launch of the Disney Fantasy in March and the Disney Dream the year before more than doubled the guest capacity of our cruise business. These amazing new ships deliver an extraordinary cruise experience and they both began contributing to operating income in their first full quarter of operation. Our cruise ship bookings are currently at 94% occupancy for the year. Meanwhile, our multi-faceted expansion of Fantasyland has begun in Orlando, it's the most popular land and our most popular park and this will be the largest expansion in the magic kingdom since Walt Disney World opened more than 40 years ago. We will complete this particular project in 2014; however, the bulk of our capital investment will be made by the end of the current fiscal year. In fact with these significant investments behind us, this will be the peak year for our capital expenditures in our domestic parks and resorts business. Going forward we expect each one of these projects to deliver strong returns on invested capital that will exceed our hurdle rate and drive improvement in our overall returns. On the international front, we have also invested in expanding Hong Kong Disneyland. Two of three new themed areas are already open and the third will open next spring. Attendance revenue and operating income for the park were all up again this quarter. Park actually set a new Q3 record for both attendance and revenue. And our investment in Shanghai Disneyland will continue to ramp to it's opening. As I have said many times before, this is the most exciting international project in the history of our company and it's certainly the biggest investment we have ever made outside the United States. Turning to our acquisitions. In Q3, we released two fantastic movies that demonstrate the incredible creativity and value of both Pixar and Marvel. Brave is Disney-Pixar\u2019s 13th consecutive movie to open at number one here in the U.S. It grossed about $225 million domestically and is yet to open on some key international markets including UK and Spain. And Marvel\u2019s the Avengers has grossed almost $1.5 billion in box-office worldwide making it the third highest grossing movie of all time. It's also an important new franchise for us as Disney Interactive, Disney Channels Worldwide, ABC Studios and Disney Consumer Products are all working to leverage the power of the Avengers to create greater value. We acquired Marvel in 2009 and with its multitude of exciting characters and as with Pixar we are confident that Marvel will be able to create original content and build franchises around these great characters to drive significant value across our company. The releases of Thor and Captain America last year built on the momentum from the first two Iron Man movies; combine these two movies grossed more than 800 million in global box-office and led to the phenomenal success of Marvel\u2019s The Avengers. When Marvel took the stage at Comic-Con last month to announce the new slated films that will keep the momentum going, the reaction was huge. Iron Man 3 opens on May 3, 2013 followed by Thor: The Dark World in November of next year. Captain America: The Winter Soldier will be in theaters in April of \u201814 and as I mentioned in our last call is the sequel to Marvel\u2019s The Avengers in the works. In fact Marvel has just signed Joss Whedon to exclusive deal and he will write and direct Avengers 2 and help develop a Marvel based series for ABC. So, as you can see Disney has a unique ability to generate new opportunities and drive significant value from great creative content. Disney, Pixar and Marvel have the incredible characters and compelling stories that people connect to, the time we have proven we can build strong long lasting franchises upon. Our acquisitions give us more than extraordinary creative content, the creative cultures, unique talent, new perspectives and commitment to excellence at Pixar and marvel are now contributing to our company\u2019s strength and along with ESPN and ABC they are creating new opportunities in numerous ways. With some of the world\u2019s strongest brands, greatest creative talent and incredibly valuable assets, Disney has never been better positioned to create continued long-term growth. And with that I will ask Jay to give you the details of our Q3 performance and then we will be back to take your questions.\nJay Rasulo: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon everyone. We delivered an exceptional quarter with segment operating income up 18% and earnings per share of $1.01 up 31% over prior year. There is a great momentum at our company as evidenced by these results which I\u2019m now going to spend a few minutes discussing in more detail then I\u2019ll highlight some factors that may influence our upcoming performance. In the third quarter, the Studio segment was the largest contributor to growth in operating income driven primarily by the tremendous worldwide box-office results of Marvel\u2019s The Avengers. Television distribution results were also higher, but this was offset by a decrease in worldwide Home Entertainment. The success of Marvel\u2019s The Avengers speaks for itself. It's a phenomenal film that dominated the box-office in every market in which it opened so we look forward to the opening of the film next week in Japan. As we look to the balance of the year and fiscal 2013, we are excited about how robust release slate. On the animation side, Pixar will release two of its animated classics in 3D for the first time, Finding Nemo in September and Monsters Incorporated in December which sets the stage for Pixar\u2019s next big film Monsters University, which will be released next June. We will also release Tim Burton\u2019s Frankenweenie in October and Disney Animation\u2019s Wreck-It Ralph in November. On the live-action front, we will release a number of highly anticipated films in 2013 including Oz The Great and Powerful in March, Iron Man 3 in May and The Lone Ranger in July. Results from television distribution were driven by higher sales of our films in international markets compared to the prior year. The decline in home entertainment results was due to lower unit sales in the third quarter including lower performance of key titles by John Carter and The Muppets compared on Tron, Tangled and Gnomeo & Juliet which were released in the prior year. Operating income growth for the Media Networks segment was driven by growth in both Cable Networks and Broadcasting. At Cable Networks, Disney Channel was the primary driver. Growth at domestic Disney Channel was driven by higher affiliate revenue due to contractual rate increases. Disney Channel continues to build and enhance brand awareness for Disney around the world, so we could not be more pleased with its recent success. Disney Channel is stronger today than ever with strength across all of its networks. In Q3, Disney Channel was the number one network with kids 2 to 11 and tweens 9 to 14. As of last week, Disney Channel had been number one with kids 2 to 11 for nine consecutive weeks. Disney XD had its highest rated third quarter ever with kids 6 to 11 and tweens 9 to 14. Our newest network, Disney Junior which we launched in March is already in 55 million homes followed by our recent agreement that brought the network to DIRECTV\u2019s customers. In June of this year, we launched the suite of Disney Channel apps with Comcast, Watch Disney Channel, Watch Disney XD and Watch Disney Junior which gives their subscribers access to live linear feeds of those networks in addition to a host of on-demand programming. This suite of services further strengthens our relationship with consumers by enhancing the value of their multichannel subscriptions. ESPN\u2019s operating income was down in the quarter due to lower recognition of deferred affiliate revenue compared to prior year. If you recall, ESPN did not defer any Comcast revenue during Q1 and Q2. So this quarter, ESPN recognized $139 million less in deferred revenue related to its Comcast agreement than in the prior year. I'll remind you the deferral issue nearly relates to timing of revenue recognition and has no impact on full-year results. Excluding this impact, ESPN\u2019s growth in affiliate rates subscribers and advertising revenue was more than offset an increase in programming and production costs. Programming and production costs were higher due to the airing of additional NBA games compared to Q3 last year as well as higher contractual rates for NBA and Major League Baseball programming. ESPN ad revenue was up mid-teen percentage points compared to last year driven by higher rates, unit sales, and ratings. Viewership of the ESPN network continue to grow during the quarter as ratings were up over 16% due to our coverage of the UEFA 2012 championship, more NBA games and increased viewership of SportsCenter and U.S. Open Golf. Reported cable margins excluding our equity investments were down 70 basis points due primarily to lower affiliate revenue recognition from Comcast. This revenue recognition change associated with Comcast affiliate revenue and an adverse impact on cable margins of approximately 220 basis points. At Broadcasting, the increase in operating income was a result of higher affiliate and royalty revenue and lower programming and production costs at our owned stations partially offset by a decrease in ad revenue at the ABC Network. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was down modestly as higher CPMs were more than offset by lower ratings in a quarter. Ad revenue at the stations was comparable to prior year. Quarter-to-date scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running mid-teens above upfront levels. At ESPN ad sales are pacing down modestly. Our advertising business has been impacted in the last couple of weeks by the Olympics. However, we are very pleased with the strong demand ABC and ESPN enjoyed in the upfront, which is evidenced in the advertiser demand for our networks remains strong. Our Parks and Resorts segment delivered another strong quarter with revenue up 9% and operating income up 21%. The increase in operating income was due to growth at Tokyo Disney Resort, Disney Cruise Line and our domestic resorts. We saw continued improvement in segment margins during the quarter, up more than 190 basis points compared to last year. Results from the Tokyo Disney Resort continue to improve reflecting the negative impact of the Japan earthquake on last year\u2019s Q3 results and the related business interruption insurance proceeds we received in Q3 this year. I\u2019d also note that Hong Kong Disneyland\u2019s operating income grew in the quarter due to increased guest spending and higher attendance. Disney Cruise Line results were higher due to the launch of the Disney Fantasy in late March. At our domestic parks, the increase in operating income was due to increased guest spending and attendance, partially offset by increased cost. For the quarter, attendance at our domestic parks was up 1% and per capita spending was up 8% on higher ticket prices and food and beverage spending. Average per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 6% driven by higher average daily rates. Occupancy decreased 1.5 points to 79% while occupied room nights were comparable to prior year, domestic inventory increased versus prior year, due to the opening of Ahwahnee and Disney's Art of Animation Resorts. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 1% while book rates are up 4%. Booking at the Disney Cruise Line are 38% higher than prior year with occupancy for the entire fleet at 94% for the year. At Consumer Products, operating income was up in the quarter due to an increase in merchandise licensing. Growth in licensing was due to lower revenue share with the studio compared to prior year and higher revenue in Japan. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was down modestly. We are pleased with the sale of Avengers merchandise and the early sell-in of Spiderman, but faced a difficult comparison given the performance of Cars merchandise last year. At the Interactive segment, we continue to make steady progress with lower operating costs in the quarter compared to prior year due to improved results in our games business. Social games results continued to benefit from lower impact of acquisition accounting for Playdom as well as improved performance driven by the success of Gardens of Time. Results of our console games business were comparable to the prior-year. During the quarter, A&E Television Networks agreed to redeem NBCUniversal\u2019s entire 15.8% equity interest in A&E for approximately $3 billion. 2.5 billion of this purchase price represents the enterprise value of NBC used equity interest in A&E and the balance represents the value of tax benefits expected to be generated as a result of the transaction. We are very pleased with the price A&E will pay to redeem this stake. We expect the transaction to close by the end of calendar 2012 at which point our ownership stake in A&E will increase to 50%. Turning to the fourth quarter, there are couple of items I\u2019d like to highlight that will impact year-over-year comparisons. ESPN will incur more than $100 million in incremental programming and production costs due primarily to contractual increases for College Football and Major League Baseball as well as higher costs associated with our new contracts for the Pac-12 and Wimbledon. At Disney Interactive, while year-to-date results have improved over prior year, we expect Q4 results to be comparable to last year. Results in our console games business faced difficult comparison given the performance of Cars 2 and Pirates LEGO in the prior year and we have no comparable titles this year as our next big title Epic Mickey 2 will be released in the beginning of fiscal 2013. We continue to repurchase our stock during the third quarter with 8.6 million shares repurchased for about $373 million. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased 55 million shares for $2.1 billion. While our pace of repurchase in the third quarter was slower than in recent quarter, it's probably more useful to look at our buybacks over the longer term than in any individual quarter. Returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase continues to be a key component of our capital allocation strategy and we intend to continue repurchasing our stock. We have not altered our thinking about the amount of capital allocated to share repurchase. We\u2019re very pleased with our Q3 results. We\u2019ve made a number of investments in last couple of years with an eye towards creating long-term sustainable value for our shareholders and we believe this quarter demonstrates the impact of these investments are having on the financial results of our company. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lowell for your questions.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Jay. Operator, we are ready to take the first question.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with Nomura. Please proceed.\nMichael Nathanson: I have two for Jay just on Parks. Jay, when you started the year, I remember you guys set rough numbers they will be about $500 million of incremental revenues and expenses related to the new ships. I wonder, now you are three quarters in the way down through the year, can you just update on where you up to those 500 million and is there any differences on the timing of revenues and expenses?\nJay Rasulo: We said last year that we would have 300 million of incremental revenue matched with cost and then an incremental 500 million this year. And we are still very much on pace for that and it seems like it will be, as we thought, pretty much match up with costs of launching, training, preopening and all of the things that go into launching these new initiatives. If you look at this quarter in particular, Michael, we think about 50 basis points of our Parks margin, the change that you saw in the Parks margin number that I gave you, is the impact of these new initiatives on the margins for the quarter. That\u2019s the Disney Cruise Line, California Adventure expansion and our Ahwahnee really represent the bulk of that 50 basis point impact.\nMichael Nathanson: I\u2019ll ask one follow-up on park trends, we\u2019re all excited about the new California park, give a sense of what the attendance trends look like through the quarter, maybe next quarter in California versus Florida, is there anything you are seeing differently than previous years?\nJay Rasulo: No, not really a big difference between those two parks as we sort of get into the summer and look at what the rest of the summer is probably going to look like and into the fall, not a huge difference.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nBen Swinburne: I have a question for Bob on Avengers and then a follow-up for Jay. Bob, last quarter you talked about being a little short on inventory at the Avengers and on the CP front, and wanting to sort of the get the company focused on fully monetizing that property. Looking at Q3, how would you sort of judge the performance of the company overall across the segments particularly at CP and at film, and how do you think about looking at this property from a licensing perspective relative to some of your other big hits like the Cars where you really didn't see much of a fall off on the licensing front as you moved out over the years beyond initial release of the film?\nBob Iger: We think Avengers is a strong property. It's not as strong as Cars from the CP front, but that's the strongest that we\u2019ve ever had. I think it's important to note that you can't look at one of these properties in terms of it franchise quality or strength in one quarter. The Avengers is probably a good example of that, because we have to look at it through the release of DVD which is late this September and obviously that takes as well in to Christmas and because the Avengers incorporates Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and the Hulk, we basically are selling products against all those characters and we\u2019ll be selling it when those are the movies, certainly Iron Man, Thor and Captain America come out. So, this is kind of a long-term proposition; Avengers not as strong as Cars but until when the DVD comes out and we get into the Christmas season, it's way too early to assess this and we have high hopes for not only the films from the individual characters that appear in the movie but that in for the sequel which will come out at a time we haven\u2019t announced yet.\nBen Swinburne: Jay, on ESPN, would you be willing to give us the affiliate revenue growth in the quarter if you exclude the deferral timing or if not [ESPN] for cable which I think will be in the queue. And the 100 million costs you called out for Q4, is that a change in the year-over-year expense growth at ESPN what we saw in Q3, because I know you obviously have recorded. You have increases in Europe in your licensee?\nJay Rasulo: Sure. Let me take the first half of your question, and then I\u2019ll talk about the 100 million. So Ben relative to our affiliate growth rate, it was pretty much flat versus prior year on a reported basis due to the impact of that Comcast deferral and we also had some unfavorable FX stuff in there but the majority of it was the deferral. If you adjust for that deferral and adjust to the FX rate as well, the Q3 cable affiliate rate growth was very similar to the first half of the year which was high single-digits. I think I gave that out in the last call. So, those two factors pretty much account for what looks like a slowdown in the reported number. On your second question about the 100 million, basically that it really matches the kind of pace of cost growth that we\u2019ve seen which is the sort of low to mid single-digits in cost growth quarter-to-quarter at ESPN nothing really special there. And that\u2019s Q4 versus prior year, Ben.\nBob Iger: I want to just provide some perspective on affiliate rate increases, because I know this has gotten some attention this last few weeks, not just for us but across the media sector. When we give a figure of high single-digits, which Jay just gave, you are looking at a blended rate of all of our networks, obviously including ESPN. Because of the size of ESPN sub fees, as you know, we\u2019ve been cautious about how we increase those rates in these new deals that we make given the fact that the fees for ESPN are as high they are, we\u2019re increasing rates on such a high base. The pricing that we get is probably the strongest in terms of a percentage increase is from the other networks led by the Disney Channel. So, we\u2019re getting tremendous price growth in some of the other channels and decent growth in ESPN, but albeit on a very, very high base.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nAlexia Quadrani: My question is on the Parks margin. Should we assume when we look into the September quarter that we could see I guess more than the 50 basis points expansion from the newer investments given that a lot more of the cost is probably rolling off in this quarter?\nJay Rasulo: Alexia, I don't feel comfortable sort of giving guidance on a specific quarter's margin, but obviously as these projects roll off the revenue they produce which is pretty much been what we expected when we pro forma these projects. All of those startup costs will drop off and we\u2019ll start producing (inaudible) against those and they won't be the margin drag that they have been. But I really don't want to talk specifically to timing, just gets too close to guidance from my taste.\nAlexia Quadrani: And then just a follow-up question on the really impressive ratings momentum you have seen at the Disney Channel, I guess given that you don't sell advertising there, is there I guess ways you can really translate that into more meaningful step ups, but it's just higher affiliate rate when context come up or is there otherwise you can monetize that impressive success you had there?\nBob Iger: Well first of all the Disney Channel programming appears on over 100 channels worldwide and many of those channels are advertised supported, so the strength of these shows while they only show up primarily in the U.S. against the sub fees, they do drive advertising in other markets around the world. The other thing that's important is, we manage these properties across businesses and we leverage their success across businesses. So, if you look at Phineas and Ferb which is a mammoth success on the Disney Channel in the U.S., that has being leveraged as a franchise across a variety of different company businesses. I\u2019ll note the tremendous success of a recent mobile game for instance is one example, Consumer Products being another one and publishing, the fact that it will show up in the products in fact that we have a movie in development against Phineas and Ferb. So, we\u2019re monetizing because of the Disney branded nature of these properties. We\u2019re managing these successful properties, the way we manage successful properties out of the studio as franchises.\nOperator: Next one comes from Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.\nJessica Reif Cohen: Could you address the retrans and affiliate comp where you are, roughly where you are in fiscal \u201812 and how will that ramp up over the next couple of years.\nJay Rasulo: We\u2019re going to stick with a total number that we gave. I really don't want to talk to how that's going to blend in overtime because we don't want to get into all the details of when deals come up for renegotiation, when we start, whether we start early and so on and so forth. So, we\u2019re going to stick with that total 450 to 500 million numbers that we gave in fiscal \u201815 sort of live with that.\nJessica Reif Cohen: And then just on the buyback, I mean, you had mentioned Jay that it was quite a slowdown in the quarter. Could you give us your current views on capital allocation? If CapEx peeks into your free cash flow growth should be at least for the domestic product should be fairly significant. Why was there a slowdown and how should we think about capital allocation in coming years?\nJay Rasulo: Let me take the bits of your statement in order. Certainly, the equity method basis and even on a consolidated basis for the next couple of years, our CapEx will drop. In fact, 2012 at least into the foreseeable future on an equity basis because a lot of the big capital bumps you will see in the future will be in Shanghai, only 43% of which is our money. You will see the reported number start to look higher as we get into the pre-opening of that part, but on the equity basis, the actual cash outflow will not reach the 2012 numbers. So, you are right about that we will be more cash flow at least netting will be less. If you look at buyback in particular, I\u2019d say this, we haven't changed our point of view at all about buying back our stock. We still believe that we trade below our intrinsic value that it is a very useful and a strategic way for us to return capital to shareholders. So, I just wouldn't read too much into what happened this quarter versus the same quarter last year, not important. We haven't changed our focus on the amount of capital or how we think about allocating capital to buybacks in the future.\nOperator: And it comes from the line of Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nSpencer Wang: It's a two-part question on ESPN. First for Jay, I think you mentioned that ESPN is pacing slightly down in the September quarter and you mentioned the Olympics. Is it all just a shift to the Olympics or is there any sort of change in tone in the scatter market? And secondly for Bob, I know international growth has been a focus for you. So for ESPN now that the English Premier League rights will go to British Telecom in the Fall 2013 and you have unwound the Star JV, can you just update us on your thoughts on the international strategy for ESPN?\nJay Rasulo: I really wouldn't read too much into the ESPN ratings other than on and of course the enormous focus that takes place around the summer games and the disruption or this equilibrium that creates in the market. We believe we have incredibly strong programming. Our upfront, which is you probably know for EPSN one of a couple or few upfronts that we do was incredibly strong, demand for our programming and our product is incredibly strong. We\u2019re not looking too much further into it than that.\nBob Iger: And by the way as it relates to the Olympics and ESPN, it made a decision at the upfront to sell deeply into this current quarter at the upfront so that they would leave themselves less vulnerable to the competitive forces of the Olympics from an advertising perspective. So, even though the Olympics are siphoning some money out of the marketplace particularly with strong ratings, ESPN was fully prepared for a quarter that would be impacted negatively by the Olympics by selling deeper into the upfront. I should also say that their sales for their Fall premier product notable college football and pro football are very, very strong and very, very encouraging. On the international front, ESPN\u2019s track record internationally has not really delivered the kind of bottom-line results that we would have liked or expected and as we look forward, we did not see the kind of growth engine from ESPN internationally and so we have approached it somewhat more conservatively. The bid that we made for instance for Premier League was we considered to be a rational bid to try to turn ESPN's business in the U.K. into a profitable business and we are outbid by very, very powerful local distributor adding really not only impossible to compete with them, but it made no sense for us to do so because it simply would not have benefited our bottom line. Asia a different story, well those we look long-term at that JV. We didn't think we would drive great growth for the company. It was also a partnership with News Corp. and every once in a while the partnerships even though we had a good one with News Corp., you have a different point of view about the future or the direction of the business and both entities felt that it would be better to go off individually and so we decided basically with News Corp. being very interested to sell our interest back to them and to pursue other markets for ESPN and internationally notably Latin America. Well we do think that we have a path well we are profitable today and we have a path to growth long-term.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Barclays. Please proceed.\nAnthony DiClemente: Two questions for Bob, just to follow-up on your recent comments there, I appreciate your comments about ESPN and the pre-sales for (inaudible) but wondering on just broader core advertising market trends with a multiyear whether you think that there is a good amount visibility in the marketplace as we look to the end of the year. Whether or not you are seeing any sort of change of tone in ad demand?\nBob Iger: I would express nothing but bullishness about ESPN\u2019s ad prospect certainly number of months maybe for the next year, live sports is still very much in demand. I think the Olympics proved that a high quality live sports events still attract large audiences and are of great interest to a variety of different advertisers. So, you have sort of multiple sectors. They had a strong upfront. By the way, as at ABC selling roughly 80% of its inventory in the upfront at increased rates. So, I think we feel generally speaking good about the market and not huge visibility, but this is what we are seeing I think we\u2019re positive particularly on the ESPN front.\nAnthony DiClemente: And then second question, Bob, on the performance of Brave, which it was impressive in its own right, maybe not as impressive as some of your existing franchises like thinking back towards the Toy Story 3. I\u2019m wondering if the performance of Brave does anything to inform your strategy at Pixar for introducing brand new brand of franchises from here particularly looking at how The Avengers did and whether or not the Marvel characters and franchises become more prominent in your overall strategy?\nBob Iger: To the point you made, we feel good about Brave, it's just under 225 million domestically and we put a character in the marketplace that is clearly very, very popular and has long legs, no pun intended, in terms of franchise ability. We\u2019ve instructed Pixar to make great movies. That's their primary priority, tell great stories and if we get good franchises out of them that's great for the company. But we're not taking a check boxes approach to how we develop. That said they do have properties in the marketplace that we really believe in. The sequel to Monsters, which comes out in 2013 would be one very good example of that. It's also kind of tough to compare things to Toy Story since that was the number one grossing animated film box office ever. What we have instructed Pixar to do is to continuing doing what they\u2019ve been doing all along and doing quite well, which is find great characters, tell great stories and when we have got one that can me mine the way Toy Story was or Cars was or some of the other properties and certainly Nemo was onto that category. Monster then we should make the film then we should leverage it, but by and large we want to make good movies tell great stories first.\nOperator: The next is from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.\nTodd Juenger: A quick one on the TV Everywhere apps, I guess especially the new kids channel app you are talking about with Comcast, and my question will be how do you see that expanding out to other distributors who I\u2019m sure would love to offer that to their subscribers and I'm sure there is various barriers to that. If you could comment on the timing or the barriers that are standing in the way of maybe getting more deals done like that and then anything you can say on the way that you could economically participate or benefit from deals like that?\nBob Iger: Sure. We\u2019re very encouraged by the apps that we launched through Comcast and the app, the ESPN app that was launched by Time Warner about a year earlier. The take up rate in terms of downloading the app and ultimately authenticating has been impressive and what's really impressive particularly from the Disney Channel side is the number of shows that have been viewed on that app. This proves a number of things to us. One, the power of mobile media, clearly the device mostly, the tablet to some extent the smartphone is a device that people are willing to watch a long-form video on particularly kids and that's very encouraging. What we've got here is a model that benefits the consumer, because it gives the consumer more ways to access the programs conveniently. It benefits the distributor, because we are protecting the business model because of the need to be a multichannel subscriber and it certainly benefits us. So, I think we will do more deals like the one that we did with Comcast. There is a veritable queue of distributors that would like to launch these apps, but we are willing to launch them as part of overall extensions of omnibus deals that we\u2019ve done with them, with the deals that we\u2019ve done for the channel and not just allow distributors to launch them basically outside of the format of an extension of our deal. On the monetization front, we are working on technology that we expect to implement probably this fall for ESPN and for the Disney branded apps to embed advertising that is discrete to these apps both on the VOD front so that when they watch an episode, but also in terms of streaming of the channel and so we have an opportunity we believe not just to use these apps to increase the value of the multichannel ecosystem, but ultimately to drive greater revenue through advertising.\nTodd Juenger: If I could ask one quick follow-up. I know that took a lot of time, so I'll try and make this real quick. Your comments on the ESPN Upfront were very helpful. I wonder if you might share some similar comments on the Kids Upfront, especially some of this might draw a conclusion that there are lot of GRPs are going out of the market. The demand seems fairly strong, so one might suspect that pricing might be way up and your share is way up, so any comments on your price or volume, you got out of the Kids Upfront would be greatly appreciated?\nBob Iger: Todd, you are right. We had a very strong Kids Upfront driven by Disney XD primarily because we\u2019ve got real growth in ratings and the strength of the programming in that channel as well as Disney Junior is enabling us to monetize at a faster pace, robust pace and to take market share. That said our position in the marketplace is relatively small, but as we said earlier in this call, we don't sell advertising on the Disney Channel. So we're driving advertising in relatively smaller channels, but we've definitely seeing strength there and real growth and we look forward to continuing to grow these channels both in terms of subscription fees from increased distribution, but also from increased advertising which is due to the popularity of the programs and the channels themselves.\nOperator: And our next is from David Bank with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nDavid Bank: First, Bob, given your opening comments, the quality and the visibility on the studio slate is really actually pretty staggering. I guess in that context, if you look over the past decade the studio kind of hit peak EBIT north of $1 billion, margins in the mid-teens. Do you think you are on a trajectory over the next couple years to get back to those kinds of earnings power numbers at the studio given the slate you outlined? And second completely unrelated question, could you remind us of when the Castle syndication money is going to head and is it comping up against any other major syndication or the timing of any other digital syndication dollars?\nBob Iger: David, no real guidance on the studio side we feel good about the slate too. With anchors from Pixar, Disney and Marvel we like our positioning and we are confident in the slate coming up. We do believe we\u2019re going to continue to improve returns on that business led by the franchises and the big brand power of our films, but no guidance in terms of what level of profitability we achieve or what we return to in terms of total profitability. Jay, you want to take the Castle question?\nJay Rasulo: On the Castle revenue recognition, David, we did recognize some in Q3 and we\u2019ll recognize even more in Q4 as there is both, we\u2019re monetizing both seasons three and four in Q4, but there's also a bump due to the fact that we will hit the magic \u201888 episodes in which there's a lift to the entire pricing of what we sold prior and we will recognize that in Q4 as well.\nDavid Bank: And that's at the Studio or Media Net? I sorry for asking.\nJay Rasulo: That's at the Media Net.\nOperator: And our next is from Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nDouglas Mitchelson: Two questions if I could. So, Bob mentioned that both cruise ships are possible in the June quarter were those cruise ship margin still held back by a marketing launch cost and if so how long does it take to reach steady state margin for those cruise ships? That's the first one.\nBob Iger: Yes, and they are behind us. So we should start to see normalized margins from this point forward.\nDouglas Mitchelson: Second question, because of some of the currency shifts, I think it will be more expensive for international visitors to come into the U.S., I think in the past, really sort of the past year or so, it seems like international attendance growth has helped drive increases in attendance at the park, so should we have any concerns regarding currency swings impacting the parks?\nJay Rasulo: Interestingly, the Q3 percent international where it really matters most is that which is at Walt Disney World was identical to the prior Q3 year ago Doug. And I will tell you there has been a bit of mix shift up where Europe which for us is primarily U.K. and Canada were down a little bit, but that slack was completely picked up by Brazil and Argentina. So, yes, there is always a possibility for currency swings to affect our business. We actually haven't seen that much of it over the last couple of years. Of course, the euro and the pound have been relatively strong for most of that period.\nDouglas Mitchelson: Well you have got a lot of experience for this, is there any kind of lag given that people plan their trips in advance? You know what point would you expect to see if we're going to see anything? Would you have seen it already?\nJay Rasulo: Generally not, I think that for the most part, particularly starting with Europe, flights from the U.K. and a long holiday in Orlando tend to be a lot more economical decision for people from the U.K. than going elsewhere in Europe, and the growth of interest in Latin America for the Disney franchise and particularly visitation to Walt Disney World is probably going to mask any relative currency swings there. The only thing we are held back by from South America is actually believe it or not our visa policy and the ability of people to get access to the market not the desire or the demand to come up to Walt Disney World.\nOperator: Our next is from Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nMarci Ryvicker: Two questions, the first, DreamWorks has recently announced plans to build a theme park in Shanghai and potentially start a kids network, any thoughts on these announcements, particularly given that this would be new competition for Disney?\nBob Iger: To my knowledge, they are not building a theme park in Shanghai. They are building some form an entertainment center and it was described in the release more of a theater district. That get to suppose to include practical theater as well as movie theater and some other forms of tourist attractions, but it is not being characterized at the theme park and is not being capitalized; mainly investment is nothing close to what it would take to build the theme park. This is more I think theater venues and retail that is entertainment based than theme park.\nMarci Ryvicker: And then A&E, you said in your last filings that you most likely will not be consolidating that, so just want to confirm. And then also related to this, any thoughts about doing a swap with Hearst in terms of your interest in A&E for their interest in ESPN?\nBob Iger: You are right on your first assertion which we do not have plans to consolidate it and I don't really want to comment on anything regarding our relationship with our partners with Hearst.\nOperator: And it comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please proceed.\nJason Bazinet: Just a question for Mr. Iger. The street seems to have soured a bit on social gaming and the prospects of social gaming; I was just wondering does it alter your view at all in terms of the importance of that division to Disney?\nBob Iger: We do. Our strategy in the games front is to diversify modest investments in console, investment in mobile and investment in social. We\u2019ve actually grown share a bit on the social front lately. Our exposure is less than some of the big competitors in that space namely one big competitor in the space and we\u2019ve actually seen some interesting growth, thanks to the new Facebook App Center that was launched recently where we\u2019re getting access to customers, Facebook users of Facebook for marketing purposes that we didn't have before. If you check the apps that are around, if you play social games, you will note that you will be marketed to by friends or through friends who are playing social games and you will be marketed from companies that create games because of the games you may have already played. And so we\u2019re getting access to a marketing platform that we actually believe is encouraging. The other thing to note is there is still growth in Facebook in terms of number of users and the numbers in terms of how much time Facebook users spend playing games are staggering. And so we still believe in that business, but our investment is relatively modest in the space. I think we launch about 10 games this year, a lot of them are based on Disney-owned IP which we believe gives us, not necessarily [advantage], but an interesting way in to that space. So we feel relatively good about it. It's not a huge business for us, but it's one that we\u2019re going to continue to be in.\nOperator: And the next one comes from Tuna Amobi with S&P Capital IQ. Please proceed.\nTuna Amobi: I have got two as well, so first for Jay, in the context of capital return and specifically share buyback, so I'm wondering given the average price that you bought back your shares so far and the current trading price of your shares by my calculation is more like 38, 39% above your share buyback average repurchase price. So, I\u2019m wondering, (inaudible) on your parameters for kind of these open market purchase season, at what point do you kind of feel that some of this capital maybe better put to use somewhere else potentially M&A opportunities and stuff like that. So, I\u2019m just trying to understand where do you kind of draw the line and say that it doesn't seem like the best use of capital.\nJay Rasulo: We obviously we want to be cognizant of our intrinsic value and be sure that we believe that far in excess of the market price and we think we\u2019ve got a lot of room. We are not worried about bumping up against that. If you look at the history of this, it's probably wise for a company to leave a little gap between their intrinsic value and the price at which they are willing to purchase because of inefficiencies in the market. But we\u2019re not up against that, we\u2019re not bumping against it. We are very happy with the concept and allocation of capital to this activity and we don't think it eclipses other fantastic growth opportunities for the company. If you look over the last five years, we have allocated 60 to 65% of the cash generated by the company to the incredible products that you see coming forth, and you know whether it's Avengers, whether it's theme park product, cruise ships, these are the kinds of things that we know we can get higher returns on and we will continue to seek those out. History of our company has been growth through acquisition. If you look at the acquisitions we\u2019ve made from Marvel and back, Playdom and the others, we feel very, very strong about the returns in that. We allocate we think the right amount of money to invest in our television networks. The Disney Channel is proof of that. Some of the great series you see coming out of ABC last year and I hope again this year. We\u2019ll show that this is first and foremost what we want to do, but it does leave us the opportunity to return capital to shareholders and we are determined to allocate a sizable portion of the cash we generate through that. If you look over the last the last few years it's been 20 to 25%. No reason to think differently about that.\nTuna Amobi: Separately, it seems like DCA has been off to a great start given the stats that Bob had given early, I'm just going to trying to reconcile that to the forward pacing that Jay provided? I know it's kind of not the main driver but I was expecting that maybe that could have started to have to have a little bit more impact overall on the attendance and the bookings and whatnot. So, if you can maybe break that out a little further for us in terms of how much of those forward pacing is actually been driven by DCA which I\u2019d expect would be above average in terms of the numbers you gave.\nBob Iger: Jay gave forward pacing on our bookings, hotel bookings. As you know, we have three hotels at Disney Land Resort, I'll compare with many, many rooms in Orlando. So, it's relatively small in the scheme of things, but pacing of bookies for the California resorts substantial ahead of the pacing for the Florida resort that they would be substantially more volume and it's being driven we believe completely by the investment we made a California Adventure not that Disneyland isn't still driving attendance, still very, very high quality experience. The numbers that we see at California Adventure are extremely impressive. I mentioned one which is about 50% of the attendance of total resort is now going to California Adventure up from 25%. The guest satisfaction level is huge particularly on the major attraction, where I think the people who are riding the primary attraction they were 100% intent on riding it again. We have huge satisfaction and higher spending on merchandise and food and beverage as well and we raised our ticket prices. So, it all is very, very good news and bodes well for the future.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of John Janedis with UBS. Please proceed.\nJohn Janedis: Bob, you've been little more aggressive on YouTube relative to some of your peers. How do you view that platform over the longer term, is it more of a branding opportunity for you or do you see that as having the EBITDA potential to be a meaningful contributor to revenue and so how big is that investments over time?\nBob Iger: We definitely see it is more than a branding opportunity. The agreement that we have with them for basically the Disney brand at our kids-oriented channel is the following. We put basically YouTube curated by Disney on Disney.com. That will be even more evident when we relaunch Disney.com later this year and we sell that advertising and then we curate the channel on the YouTube platform and we share that revenue with YouTube. So we think that given some of the number that we\u2019ve seen through the basically the beta that we have launched already that is an opportunity to increase consumption, increase revenue from that and also use it to drive more users to Disney.com and to increase the value as a marketing platform. So it has multiple effects and we\u2019ve not been specific about the nature of the investment but it is modest.\nJohn Janedis: Maybe one for Jay quickly, Jay you talked about South America and Europe. Has there been any change in length of stay from your international guest?\nJay Rasulo: Not appreciable, no.\nLowell Singer: Thanks again everyone for joining us today.

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Walt Disney Company's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued 45 minutes ago and is now available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast, and that webcast, along with the transcript, will also be available on the website after the call. Joining me in Burbank today are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob's going to lead off, followed by Jay, and then, of course, we'll be happy to take your questions.  So with that, I'll turn it over to Bob and we'll get started.\nRobert A. Iger: Thank you very much, Lowell. Good afternoon. We're very pleased with the company's strong performance in the second quarter with earnings per share up 18% over last year when adjusted for comparability. Growth in advertising and affiliate fees in Media Networks as well as greater attendance and guest spending in our parks and resorts primarily drove our performance.  There are many exciting things happening across our businesses starting with The Avengers, which, as all of you know, shattered industry box office records, achieving the biggest domestic opening weekend of all time with $207.1 million. The movie set new opening weekend records in several other countries as well, bringing its worldwide box office gross to more than $700 million to date.  It's a fantastic movie, and we're obviously thrilled that audiences around the world share that opinion. It's also a great illustration of why we like Marvel so much: great characters, great storytelling and the wonderful ability for them to bring their characters and stories to the big screen so effectively. Ironman, Thor and Captain America initially brought those compelling characters to millions of people, leading to the tremendous success we're now seeing with The Avengers. And we'll continue to build on this incredible franchise with the release of Iron Man 3 and Thor 2 next year, followed by Captain America 2 in 2014. And since I'm sure I will be asked, yes, we are in development on a sequel to Avengers.  There\u2019re obviously numerous benefits to creating such a valuable franchise, and one of them is in our Consumer Products business, where our combined Disney-Marvel licensing team is hard at work bringing those characters to market in multiple ways, significantly growing our retail presence around the world. And based on early figures, the demand for Avengers merchandise has been very strong. We actually have a lot of other great new movies on the way as well, starting with Disney/Pixar's BRAVE, a brilliant action-adventure featuring Pixar's first female hero. And then later this year, we're looking forward to Frankenweenie, Tim Burton's heartwarming twist on the classic monster movie, as well as Disney Animation's Wreck-It Ralph, which takes viewers into the world of classic video arcade games. And next year, we've got Oz The Great and Powerful, as well as Johnny Depp's Tonto in The Lone Ranger and a Monsters, Inc. prequel from Disney-Pixar. We've also got plenty to be excited about in our other businesses. Our media networks, ESPN, Disney Channels, ABC, ABC Family [ph] plus our equity stakes in A&E, History and Lifetime [ph] , represent an incredibly valuable growth-driving segment for us with multiple revenue streams supported by strong, high-quality, creative content leveraged across territories and on many new digital platforms. It's almost a clich\u00e9 to mention ESPN as the strongest brand in media, but it continues to strengthen and to grow. And in 2011, more adults 18 to 49 watched ESPN than any other 24-hour cable network. And fans are spending more time with ESPN-branded media on TV, online and on a variety of mobile devices than any other sports brand. ESPN delivers tremendous value to distributors with an unparalleled content array that helps to drive broadband subscriptions, local ad sales and HD upgrades. And with numerous sports rights agreements in place into the next decade, including the NFL, the ACC, the SEC, Pac-12 and Wimbledon, and long-term agreements in place with 2 of the largest multichannel providers, ESPN is obviously quite well positioned to remain the preeminent sports brand.  It's also worthy of noting that as of today, Comcast subscribers can download the WatchESPN app that brings the total number of subscribers that can now access ESPN's channel on mobile devices to 40 million. While we had mentioned the Disney Channel on these calls on numerous occasions, we thought it was time to put its accomplishments in perspective. With 103 channels in 167 countries right now, Disney Channel is our biggest and most effective global brand builder and content engine, taking Disney into hundreds of millions of homes every day. And the list of markets where we are in continues to expand, sometimes in pretty dramatic ways. An example of this is in Russia, where we launched a free-to-air channel in January to excellent ratings, and it's just the beginning. Here in the U.S., Disney Channel is a top destination for kids and tweens. And for the last 3 months, it has been the #1 network among kids 2 to 11, supported by 3 of the top 10 shows among that essential audience.  Original programming is also driving the success of Disney Junior, where we've got the top preschooler shows, including Jake and the Neverland Pirates and our newest animated hit, Doc McStuffins.  And after achieving record ratings again last year, Disney XD's core audience continues to grow, drawn by the exciting programming that defines that brand.  So when you think about this collection of Disney-branded channels, consider their strength in terms of program quality, program success, reach, brand building effectiveness and financial growth. And rounding out our cable portfolio, ABC Family continues to build on its eighth consecutive years of growth with an ambitious slate of original programming. The channel is not only popular with Millennials [ph] , it's currently the #3 cable network in all key female demos. And the same high-quality, original content that draws audiences to ABC Family here in the U.S. is now being sold into several hundred markets around the world. On the network side, we're a week away from the ABC upfront where we'll introduce our shows for next season, and we're anticipating a strong upfront marketplace. And we're very impressed by the quality of our pilots, particularly those from ABC Studios. We're building on the strength of our current schedule, with ABC-owned Grey's Anatomy [ph], the #1 drama, and Once Upon a Time, the #1 new drama, as well as television's #1 comedy, Modern Family [ph], and Revenge, one of the season's top new series. With strong demand for our content around the world, we're currently selling ABC programming into more than 225 international markets, and our success has allowed us to presell our new series globally often before they air on the network.  Our ABC Studios business is meaningful. Revenue from domestic and international syndication and digital sales will reach an all-time high this year and has grown 25% per year over the past decade. As we've articulated on numerous occasions, global expansion remains a key part of our strategy, and China is a top priority for us. During my recent visit to China, I met with Vice President Xi Jinping about our current initiatives and future opportunities. I was very encouraged by his support and enthusiasm for our plans, especially Shanghai Disney Resort, which is a critical investment for our long-term growth there. The Shanghai Disney Resort site is fully cleared, and the land has been prepared for construction. And visiting the site the week before last gave us a visual validation of just how vast and how significant this project is for us. We have several investments in our Parks and Resorts now coming online or near completion, all of which we're very optimistic about. Our expansion of Hong Kong Disneyland is also proceeding nicely and features 3 new themed areas, including the hugely popular Toy Story Land, which we opened in 2011, as well as Grizzly Gulch, which comes online later this year. And we're happy with the progress of Hong Kong Disneyland as well as the fact that it just had another great quarter. California Adventure, we're looking forward to the June 15 opening of Cars Land, an incredible 12-acre addition that transports guests right into the world of Radiator Springs. And with 3 new attractions and theme restaurants, Cars Land is the culmination of the expansion we started with Toy Story Mania!, Little Mermaid and the spectacular World of Color. I believe the completion will result in a park that will both stand on its own but also serve as an important and worthy neighbor to Disneyland and finally enable the 2 to become the destination resort we once envisioned. And lastly, on the cruise ship front, we recently launched the Disney Fantasy, the sister ship to the Dream, which sets sail in 2011, and the 2 new ships have proven to be extremely popular with strong bookings. A few of us had the chance to sail on the Fantasy's maiden voyage with over 3,000 other guests, and the ship is visually stunning, the sailing experience truly wonderful. It's impossible to fully explain just how magnificent this ship really is. The quality, the service and the attention to the very smallest details create the kind of extraordinary family vacation that only Disney can provide. And by the way, a lot of the people on that first maiden voyage reserved future trips. So as you can see, in Parks and Resorts, many of our long-term investments are now coming to fruition, driving increased performance and positioning us for future growth. Our commitment to creative excellence is also evident on Broadway. The Lion King is now the top-grossing Broadway production of all time, and our 2 newest productions, Newsies and Peter and the Starcatcher, just turned an impressive 17 Tony nominations.  I also want to mention our Disney Interactive team who are also leveraging creative content from our lines of business to generate games and other interactive content. Marvel: Avengers Alliance is the first social media game ever based on the Marvel brand, and it already has nearly 1.5 million daily players. Animal Kingdom Explorers is a popular game based on Disney's Animal Kingdom Park and builds on the hidden objects game success of Gardens of Time, which is now available on mobile platforms. We just recently launched disneychannel.com, a new highly interactive, consumer-friendly site for kids and family. In a few weeks, we'll introduce our Disney video product, which includes a Disney YouTube family-friendly destination. And then later this year, we'll launch an all-new Disney.com. So in closing, we're obviously pleased with the results in the quarter and thrilled with the reaction to Avengers, but we remain extremely excited about the future for all of our businesses. We're seeing revenue increases in Media Networks, driven by the quality of our content and the consumer demand for it; we're welcoming more guests to our parks and resorts as a result of our expansions and enhanced experiences; and we're very optimistic about what's being developed and constructed for the years ahead. And we're using characters and creativity from Disney, Pixar and Marvel to deliver extraordinary entertainment and drive franchises across our entire company. We're expanding the reach of our content and consumer access to it on a variety of new platforms, while we're dramatically expanding our international presence in the traditional and emerging markets around the world. So here's Jay for the details about the quarter and some comments about current business trends. Jay?\nJames A. Rasulo: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered strong financial performance during the second fiscal quarter with operating income up 10% on a revenue growth of 6%. Earnings per share, excluding certain noncomparable items, were up 18%. These results continue to demonstrate the success of our strategy, the strength of our company's assets, the unique competitive position and our ability to generate attractive returns on investment over the long term.  I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing the second quarter in more detail and then highlight some factors that may influence our upcoming performance.  In the second quarter, Media Networks was the largest contributor to our performance. Operating income growth for the segment was primarily driven by growth in Cable Networks, with ESPN and the domestic Disney Channels being the main drivers.  ESPN's growth was due to higher affiliate and advertising revenues as well as lower affiliate revenue deferrals compared to the prior year. The growth in affiliate revenues were due to contractual rate increases. ESPN deferred $72 million less in revenue during the second quarter compared to last year. And I'll remind you that this change in ESPN's revenue recognition is related to Comcast affiliate revenue and has no impact on full year results. ESPN's Q2 advertising revenue was up 14% compared to prior year and up an estimated 6% when adjusted for the timing of the Rose and Fiesta bowls and the impact of the NBA lockout. If you'll recall, the Rose and Fiesta Bowls aired during our second quarter this year, but those games fell in our first quarter last year. As I mentioned last quarter, despite the NBA lockout, ESPN aired the same number of regular-season NBA games as last year. However, the number of games per quarter was different. We have aired 9 more games during Q2 compared to prior year, and there are 20 additional NBA games during the third quarter compared to prior year. So far this quarter, ESPN ad sales are pacing up high single digits. Growth at the domestic Disney Channels was driven by higher affiliate revenue due to contractual rate increases and higher sales of Disney Channel programming. At ABC Family, the decision to further invest in original programming during the quarter is paying off as the network continues to resonate with viewers and advertisers. For the quarter, ABC Family prime time ratings were up 7% among adults 18 to 49. ABC also had 3 of the top 5 basic cable, scripted, original series among females 12 to 34: Pretty Little Liars, which was #1; Switched at Birth; and the Lying Game. ABC Family ad revenue was up 12% in the quarter, and that follows the 10% growth delivered last quarter. So far during the third quarter, ABC Family ad sales are pacing up 10%. Reported cable margins, excluding our equity investments, were down 100 basis points in the quarter. However, this decline was due to a net negative impact of 170 basis points resulting from several noncomparable factors. On the positive side, we had the benefit of the change in the Comcast revenue deferral. On the negative side, there was the impact of the timing of the Rose and Fiesta bowls, the NBA schedule changes and the incremental expense we incurred for ABC Family programming and to launch our Japan broadcast satellite channel. On balance, the negative factors outweigh the positive factor, thus driving the net negative impact of 170 basis points. At Broadcasting, the increase in operating income was the result of higher advertising revenue as well as lower programming and production costs. The increase in ad revenue was due to higher rates at the ABC network, partially offset by lower ad revenue at our owned stations.  Ad revenue at the ABC network was up 6% during the quarter. Ad revenue at the stations was down 8% in the quarter. Excluding the Flint and Toledo stations, which we sold in Q3 last year, ad revenue at the stations was down 5%. Quarter-to-date, scatter pricing at the ABC network is running over 20% above upfront levels. Q3 TV station ad sales are pacing down low single digits. On the cost side, lower programming and production costs reflect the absence of the Oprah Winfrey Show at our owned stations as well as lower daytime and new production costs at the network. At our Parks and Resorts -- our Parks and Resorts segment delivered another strong quarter with revenues up 10% and operating income up an impressive 53%. Operating income was higher at our domestic resorts, Tokyo Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, partially offset by a decrease at Disneyland Paris. We saw continued improvement in segment margin store [ph] in the quarter, up more than 200 basis points compared to last year. At our domestic parks, the increase in operating income was due to increased guest spending and attendance, partially offset by increased costs. For the quarter, attendance at our domestic parks was up 7%, and per capita spending was up 5% on higher ticket prices and food and beverage spending. Average per-room spending at our domestic hotels was up 7%, while occupancy increased almost 2 percentage points to a little over 82%. The increase in per-room spending was driven by higher average daily rates.  The results at our domestic parks and resorts confirm that our strategy of restoring pricing to normalized levels continues to pay off. During the quarter, we enjoyed growth in pricing and volume, both at our domestic parks and at our domestic resorts, with Disneyland setting a new Q2 attendance record, reflecting the success of our continued expansion of Disney's California Adventure. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 1%, while booked rates are up low single digits. Q3 bookings at the Disney Cruise Line are 30% higher than prior year with occupancy for the entire fleet now over 90%.  At our international parks and resorts, better results from the Tokyo Disney Resort reflect the negative impact of the Tokyo earthquake during Q2 last year and the related business interruption insurance proceeds we received in Q2 this year. We continue to enjoy strong performance at Hong Kong Disneyland with the park achieving Q2 records in revenue and attendance. The growth in operating income during the second quarter was due to increased guest spending and higher attendance. At Disneyland Paris, operating income was lower due to lower attendance and higher labor costs. At Studio Entertainment, operating income declined in the quarter due to the performance of John Carter compared to prior year titles, which included Tangled and Mars Needs Moms as well as higher film impairments in the quarter driven by John Carter. At Consumer Products, operating income was up for the quarter due to increased -- an increase in Merchandise Licensing, partially offset by lower results in our retail business. Growth in licensing was due to higher recognition of guaranteed shortfall revenue as well as higher merchandise sales. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up 3%.  At the Interactive Media segment, operating losses were lower compared to prior year due to improved results in our games business. Social games results benefited from the lower impact of acquisition accounting at Playdom, as well as improved performance driven by higher revenue from Gardens of Time. The improvement at console games in the quarter was due to lower product development expenses as we continued to focus on developing fewer console games and more social games. Turning to the third quarter, there are a number of items that will impact year-over-year comparisons. At ESPN, net deferred revenue recognition for Q3 will be $140 million lower than prior year since we no longer defer revenues from Comcast as part of our new deal. ESPN will also incur about $35 million in additional costs due to 20 extra NBA games in the quarter compared to last year.  During the second quarter, NBCUniversal exercised an option that requires A&E Television Networks to purchase a substantial portion of NBCUniversal's 15.8% equity interest. The transaction is expected to close following determination of value of NBCUniversal's equity interest and will result in an increase in our equity interest in A&E, which, at the end of the second quarter, stood at approximately 42%. We expect to continue to account for our interest in AETN as an equity method investment.  We continued to repurchase our stock during the second quarter by buying back 21.4 million shares for about $870 million, which is consistent with the pace during the second quarter last year. Fiscal year-to-date, we have purchased 51 million shares for $1.9 billion.  We are pleased with our Q2 results and our current business momentum and the ongoing process of our growth initiatives and competitive position in our Media Networks. That, coupled with the strongest balance sheet in the industry, gives us great confidence that our strategy of managing the company for long-term success will continue to deliver returns to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell for questions\nLowell Singer: Okay, thanks Jay. Operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Starting with Avengers, I'm wondering if you could talk a little about how we should think about the Consumer Products benefit and, in particular, the change in the relationship -- sorry, that's a Sony comment, on -- no, [indiscernible] -- just the timing of when you would recognize merchandising revenues for that film and how you're thinking about sort of the plan to monetize that particular title along the licensing front. And then, Jay, can I just ask a follow-up? The -- was the insurance settlement a meaningful contributor to margin in the parks this quarter? I just want -- you called that out, and that was one thing I didn't know.\nJames A. Rasulo: Okay, let me start, Ben, with the insurance question. So there's -- there are a lot of moving parts for our Tokyo results and, ultimately, their impact on the overall Parks and Resorts margins for the quarter. But the -- it was a driver. We had - first of all, we had the comparison between last year when Tokyo Disney Resort was closed for 3 weeks in the quarter versus the current week. Secondly, we had a business interruption payment this year that we received relative to that quarter. And finally, the performance of Tokyo Disney Resort actually improved over the comparable operating weeks compared to the prior year. So the aggregate benefit of all of these effects was about $50 million in Q2.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Any -- could you quantify the onetime insurance piece of that just for our benefit?\nJames A. Rasulo: I'm -- yes, I'm not sure it's frankly relevant compared to the fact that the park was closed in prior year. But roughly, it's $15 million.\nRobert A. Iger: Well, I'll try to give you some perspective both on the licensing side of Avengers and on Avengers in general. First of all, there was substantial amount of interest in the film among I'll call it the consumer products industry, more interest than some of its predecessor films, Thor and Captain America. But the interest was not commensurate with what we've already seen in terms of the success of the movie and the interest in the movie among audiences around the world. So what you basically have is you have extraordinary demand for the products that are on the shelves and, in many cases, product that's already been sold out. So our global licensing team is hard at work working with licensees and retailers around the world to stock the shelves as fast as possible. We expect, given the interest in this film, that demand for its product is going to continue to be strong pretty much throughout the year. But given the plan that we have for this film and the characters, it's our complete and -- or full intent to make sure that demand for consumer products continues. So as I mentioned in my calls, in 2013, you're going to see a sequel to Thor 2, and you're going to see Iron Man 3. In 2014, you're going to see a sequel to Captain America, and then eventually, a date to be determined, you'll see a sequel to Avengers and so on. The other thing that we're seeing is that interest in other characters like The Hulk for instance, is also strong. That had always been a decent merchandise product for Marvel in the past, but the presence of the character in this film and the performance of the actor, the popularity has actually grown significantly. So there's real demand for Hulk product in the marketplace right now. So I think what you're essentially seeing here is a true franchise not necessarily in the making but having been made and launched. And I -- the box office is only one part of it. There are multiple opportunities to continue to mine this great set of characters. And while it all started with a set of really good movies, we fully intend to continue to fuel the marketplace with Marvel's Avengers-related stories and characters so that the momentum continues.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of us Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.\nSpencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Bob, maybe just a follow-up question on Marvel and Consumer Products in 2 parts. The first is if you look at Marvel holistically in terms of the licensing opportunity, I think one of the big synergy opportunities from the acquisition that you talked about in the past is driving higher penetration abroad for the Marvel licensing and the characters. So I was wondering if you could just update us on where is that today. I think back pre-acquisition, 40% of Marvel's licensing revenue was international. Where is that today? And then secondly, as you look at the portfolio of characters, would you consider buying back the film rights to some of the other characters, say, like X-Men from FOX?\nRobert A. Iger: I'll answer the second part of the question first. Marvel's got a slew of great characters to mine, and we'll continue to do that. They've got development in the works for a number of unnamed characters that are going to give us and Marvel the ability to make numerous films over the years ahead. So I don't think you'll see necessarily a need to buy back characters or all that much opportunity. On the licensing front, we're fully integrated internationally. Marvel used to use third parties frequently to represent them on the licensing side. We have a global licensing organization that we fully integrated with some really talented Marvel folks. And that, we believe, will not only -- has not only reduced costs because we're paying basically third-party representatives to handle licensing on behalf of Marvel, but we believe that the combined entity has a much more effective ability to gain access to the marketplace and increase our presence at retail. And with the quality of the films that Marvel is making, the interest in them -- that -- obviously increases that much more. No specifics, though, in terms of the percentage represented by international sales. Clearly, the box office side is really significant and should continue to be. This, we believe, will be the most successful Marvel film internationally, and that obviously will give us some great opportunities on the licensing front, too.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I have one more Marvel question and then a separate question. Can you talk about plans, if you have any, for integrating Marvel characters into the theme parks? Any attractions that you plan?\nRobert A. Iger: I won't be specific. We do have plans. As we noted when we announced the acquisition, there are some encumbrances, notably in Florida, where an old deal that Marvel had in place with Universal precludes us from creating a presence in Orlando. But we have a number of other opportunities, unencumbered situations, at our other parks, notably California and Europe and in Asia. I guess that pretty much covers the rest of the world. And our Imagineering group has been working over the last year. We've actually ramped it up more recently to create more opportunities for Marvel in the parks. I will note, by the way, I got a note from Tom Staggs earlier that all the Marvel product that we've been selling in our parks is pretty much off-the-shelves. So we're hard at work there. We control our pipeline product a little bit more. So we're hard at work replenishing the stuff on our shelves. But interest is clearly keen wherever our Marvel characters are touching the public.\nJessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And then I just want to ask about Cars Land. I mean, it sounds pretty exciting. And should -- I mean, if it works as you guys are laying it out, it should increase the length of stay in Anaheim. Are there plans to build future hotels?\nRobert A. Iger: We're opening Cars Land in the middle of June. We've been specific about it. It is 12 acres, it has 3 attractions. I think I mentioned that. And it is the culmination of the -- both the improvements and the expansion at California Adventure. We've also done a great job of creating an entirely new entry sequence, and it comes on top of some attractions that have been very popular already, Toy Story Mania! or Midway Mania and World of Color and Little Mermaid. We believe, Jessica, that this will give us an opportunity to increase length of stay. It also gives us some leverage on the ticket pricing side, which we hope to take advantage of. We just redid the Disneyland Hotel there. We did some expansion on -- the hotel was built when we opened California Adventure, the Grand Californian. But mostly on the vacation front side, we've not announced any plans to increase our hotel inventory there, but we do have the ability to do so either by expanding one of the existing hotels or building a new hotel. And I think what we'll do is we'll take a wait-and-see approach to see how the park performs even though we have a lot of confidence in it, test the marketplace. And if we have an opportunity, we certainly will take advantage of it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Could you give us a bit more color on the impressive attendance trends at the parks in the quarter? I guess just -- or makeup of international, local and sort of regular sort of domestic visitors? And then second question, if you could just update us your thinking about use of cash given the expected pickup in free cash flow in the back half of this year and into 2013?\nJames A. Rasulo: Sure, I'll be happy to, Alexia. Let me start out with the attendance origin question. So the quarter was pretty strong on international attendance. We are now -- I've always talked about the sort of 18% to 22% range of international attendance at Walt Disney World. And in fact, we're at the very high end of that range in the previous quarter. We've seen a lot of visitation from Brazil in particular, which is not a new market for us, but it -- but increasingly becomes an increasingly important market. Canada always stays an important market out here at Disneyland. We're also in the range there, pretty high, approaching 10% of international visitation, lots of it from Asia. On the domestic side, domestic visitors outside of the state of Florida and outside of the state of California, we were relatively flat on the quarter versus prior year. And of course, because of all the new stuff we're doing, we're seeing a lot of -- a big pickup in resident attendance and a lot of demand on the Annual Pass programs, particularly out here on the West Coast. So we're very happy about what we're seeing, gives us, particularly at Disney's California Adventure, a very good feeling about what's to come when we finally drop the rope on that in mid-June. The -- your second question was about cash. I presume that you are asking about returns to shareholders, which we, of course, always talk about aggressively as part of our overall strategy. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are pacing at the same level with now about $2 billion worth of buybacks in the first half of the fiscal year. You'll remember last year we ended up buying back about $5 billion in the year. And that's not to be predictive, but we are always out there and opportunistically looking to make an investment in our own stock, and we will continue to do so as part of our fundamental strategy. I don't need to remind you that we increased our dividend significantly last year. Well, the board did. And of course, we will -- they will look at that again as we near the end of this year, our goal being to stay in the pack in terms of the yield that we pay against our stock. We're quite conscious of that and had fallen behind and don't want to fall behind again.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.\nDouglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Bob, if you take a step back and look at the last few years, it's been a pretty heavy investment cycle, right? So Marvel, Parks CapEx, Disney Channel, international, more sports, ESPN, plenty of others. When you look forward, would you say the company is shifting to more of a harvesting stage at this point? Or do you see or want to undertake another round of investment? And obviously, I'm thinking outside of the Shanghai park, which we're all well aware of.\nRobert A. Iger: I think you're likely to see relatively prudent behavior over the next number of years. We'll obviously continue to look opportunistically. But we do have some commitments that will continue to be reflected in increased capital spending. Then -- the one that is most notable is Shanghai Disneyland and the completion of the Fantasyland redo or build-out in Florida. But I think you're likely to see a fairly prudent period for the company. Not to suggest that we won't take advantage of what we think is a great opportunity, but I'll leave it at that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.\nAnthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I have one for Jay and one for Bob. Jay, you've been clear that through affiliate fee growth and advertising growth, that ESPN will more than cover the increase in costs from your NFL rights increases. I guess the question is, as you look out on the progression of that, is it appropriate to think that because of the nature of the step-up in the fees in 2014, that ESPN margins could at least temporarily compress because of the step-up nature of those fees, at least until the curves on affiliate fee and advertising revenue catch up with those fees? And then my question for Bob, I think you guys mentioned in your prepared remarks on social games your strategy is to develop more social games than console games. And so I'm wondering if you can give us an update on that strategy. I mean, we've seen these games like Draw Something on the iPhone pop up so quickly and resonate with kids in time spent. I mean, that's your bread and butter on your target demographic. I'm just wondering what the strategy at Disney mobile is in terms of attacking that market.\nJames A. Rasulo: Let me start, Anthony. This is Jay. I don't want to be predictive. We've made a practice of not being predictive on margins and looking too far down the road. But let me take the opportunity to talk a little bit about what happened in this current quarter in terms of affiliate revenue growth. So on a reported basis, cable revenue growth grew at over 10%, and ESPN grew almost at 12% in terms of affiliate fees. Of course, you have to adjust for the things I spoke about in my prepared remarks, the covenant-related Comcast deal, the other puts and takes that I mentioned. And if you do that, ESPN affiliate revenue was up high single digits in the quarter, which was comparable to the growth that we achieved in the first quarter. So that gives you some sense of what -- where we are even though, obviously, we are seeing some of the escalations in sport deals we have in place already in our numbers.\nRobert A. Iger: And on the games front, our -- as you know, our stated goal was to turn our digital media business into a profitable business in 2013. And it's reflected in this quarter and will be reflected in 2012, where we continue on the path to deliver that. One way to do that was to decrease our investment in console games and increase our investment, or diversify our investment, to social and to mobile games. And I don't think that it would be fair to conclude that we've given social a priority, even though we purchased Playdom, to enable us to get more into that business. We've actually spent a fair amount of time and investment on mobile games and have had some considerable success, notably Where's My Water?, which, for a period of time, was the #1 downloaded mobile game on the iTunes platform ahead of another very popular game that involved birds. So we think that you're right that we see a dramatic increase in the time and money spent, particularly among our core demographic, on mobile platforms. We actually think that they are going to continue to penetrate the market more profoundly, particularly outside the United States, and our presence on that -- those platforms is very, very important. The other thing to note is that the development cost for both the social games and for the -- and the -- basically the production costs for social and the mobile games are relatively inexpensive. So in order for us to get to profitability, we have to reduce expenses, and one way to do that is to deemphasize console and emphasize the other. And I think that actually is timed right to the market because you're seeing such a dramatic increase in time and money spent on those other platforms.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alan Gould with Evercore.\nAlan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: At the analyst meeting last year, you had a slide showing Cars merchandise -- Cars 1 merchandise revenue consistently over $200 million, say $215 million to $240 million, a year for number of years. Are we talking The Avengers having the ability to be as high as the Cars type of numbers?\nRobert A. Iger: Cars was pretty extraordinary because it obviously took great advantage of very, very distinct play pattern among boys all over the world. And those die-cast cars as well as all kinds of other cars were extraordinarily popular, both when we put out Cars 1 and Cars 2, I think actually our #1 Consumer Products franchise of all time. It would be premature for me to predict that Marvel's Avengers is going to get to that level, but we're obviously bullish about where it can get to. And I think I'll just leave it at that.\nAlan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay, if I can have a follow-up with Jay. Jay, the last public numbers on A&E Network was EBITDA of about $800 million in '09. Then EBITDA increased to about $1.1 billion. And is that entity still basically unlevered?\nJames A. Rasulo: Well, I'm not going to comment on the future profitability on -- of A&E. And in terms of its leverage, it is relatively unlevered, yes.\nAlan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Can you tell us what -- last year what -- 2011, the historic -- the latest year was?\nJames A. Rasulo: No. Sorry, we don't break that out, Alan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Barton Crockett with Lazard.\nBarton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: I was interested in the discussion of a news network launch with Univision. And in particular, how should we think about the materiality of that for the Cable Network segment over the next couple of years? And how should we think about the expense impact on broadcast? Because I assume there's an opportunity to share costs between this new network and ABC.\nRobert A. Iger: Well, it's -- look, we're excited about the opportunity, particularly given the dramatic increase and the size of the Hispanic market in the United States. And we think it's a good opportunity for ABC News to expand its presence beyond the ABC Network. But the investment in this is relatively modest, and so its impact on the overall business is going to be relatively small.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Janedis with UBS.\nJohn Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: With the proliferation of tablets, I would think there's going to be a fair amount of kids viewing on them. Can you give us maybe an update on the timing around a measurement standard and to what extent you see this an opportunity for you?\nRobert A. Iger: Yes, I agree with you. I think you're going to see continued consumption of particularly film entertainment on tablets around the world. And that's great for us. We are hard at work at creating a set of apps to enable subscribers of multichannel services to watch these channels on these mobile or tablet devices as well as smartphones. I mentioned in my call we launched ESPN today to Comcast subscribers. And we're going to be launching apps for subscribers of the Disney Channel in June, and that's a big deal because suddenly, you'll be able to watch all this programming, both streamed live but also on an on-demand basis, on these devices provided you're a subscriber. What that does is it pays us incremental money in terms of the money that we're being paid by the multichannel providers. It also helps protect the value of that product to the distributors and increases the value of the product to the subscribers. And it does give us additional opportunities to either up-sell other product or to sell advertising in certain cases. I can't, at this point, give you some -- an estimate on just what the upside could be, but we clearly believe that we're going to increase engagement with our programming on multiple fronts, ESPN, all the Disney channel programming, ABC and ABC Family. And by increasing that engagement, there are all kinds of opportunities to monetize.\nJohn Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And Jay, just to clarify, on the high single-digit pacing\u2019s at ESPN, does that include the 9 extra NBA games? And if so, is there maybe an adjusted number you can give us?\nJames A. Rasulo: No, that backs -- those that -- backs those numbers -- those games out.\nRobert A. Iger: It's an actual pacing.\nJames A. Rasulo: Oh, the pacing number? I'm sorry. I thought you were talking about the affiliate revenue.\nRobert A. Iger: Yes.\nJames A. Rasulo: Yes, the pacing number has those games in it.\nRobert A. Iger: Yes.\nJohn Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Is there a way to get a cleaner number off that? Would it still be positive, do you think, or...\nJames A. Rasulo: No, we don't have that on the pacing, sorry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Miller with Caris & Company.\nDavid W. Miller - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: I have 2 for Bob. Bob, are you still prognosticating making money in the Interactive business in fiscal '13? And the second one is, with the Rich Ross' departure, as you assess perhaps filling in that position or what have you, does any scenario go through your mind where upon you could imagine just not having any Chairman of the Studio at all? And the reason I say that is because it seems like the Marvel unit is kind of somewhat self-contained, they kind of run themselves, although there's obviously a lot of cooperation and symbiosis with your other businesses. Pixar's obviously run by John Lasseter. You maybe clearly need somebody to run sort of the Walt Disney Pictures label. But do you really need a Chairman of the Studio? It just seems like it's too many layers, and I'm wondering if you can comment on that.\nRobert A. Iger: As I said a few minutes ago, David, we -- our target goal is for DIMG [ph] to be profitable in 2013, and we're taking a step in that direction, a dramatic step actually in 2012 and we're not abandoning that as a goal. As for the Studio, I really have little to say about where we're headed in terms of management except to remind everybody really that it is a big, complex, global business that involves multiple entities, multiple moving parts, that all need to be coordinated very, very carefully and very, very aggressively. You mentioned the multiple entities, but the Studio markets and distributes those multiple entities and gets involved with many issues related to both the making of the movies at those individual units and distribution and management of the -- of those movies, as well as the library and all the other aspects of the Studio that exist, like the live entertainment business, our Broadway plays and the music business. Maybe that's a way of my saying that this is a business that probably requires someone to run it, and I'm not going to get any more specific than that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein.\nTodd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: So picking up a little bit on John's question, I think it\u2019d be remiss if we didn't get your comment, to sort of wrap up the last couple of weeks, on what's going on with kids TV and, specifically, the relationship, sort of what's going on with traditional [ph] linear delivery, how that relates in your view of the situation with what's going on at Netflix and how that thinking impacts you as you approach the renewal decision you have with Netflix in Q4, as well as the various TV Everywhere deals that you're also talking about. Those sort of all 3 things, do they all exist together? Or how does all play out in your view?\nRobert A. Iger: Okay, well I'll start with the fact that the Disney Channel\u2019s ratings are probably the highest they've ever been, meaning at least from a competitive perspective. They're enjoying great success. I believe that great success is solely the result of great programming. And there are a number of programs that are delivering those great ratings. We have been aggressive as a company at being present on new platforms because we believe that by and large, they create incremental revenue opportunities and thereby increase your interest in our programs and relevance. We also have managed our presence on these platforms very carefully because the digital media business is still nascent and certainly dynamic. It's changing right before our eyes. What we believe we've done is to strike a pretty good balance between protecting the core, or the traditional business and platforms, and taking advantage of new opportunities on new digital platforms, which also happens to give viewers more access to these programs, both from a time perspective and a place perspective, than they've ever had before. We have not seen any negative impact from the presence of Disney Channel shows on these new platforms. Most of them, by the way, are not available until after a season ends. And I think on the Netflix deal, there's only 4 that are. And what we found is that the product that is available on the linear channel through the multichannel provider is simply much richer, much more diverse and much more attractive to the consumer than what's available on the other platforms. Not that the other platforms, the new ones, aren't good. They are, but they pale in comparison in terms of how attractive they are to the consumer. So that's a long way of my saying that we feel good about the balance that we've struck, we're going to continue to look and watch very carefully. We believe it would be wrong for us to remove our product from these new media platforms, particularly as they grow, just as it would be wrong for us to be cavalier or reckless about the traditional business, which is delivering so much value to our company and our distributors. And that's why the Watch apps were created. It creates an unbelievable balance, as far as we're concerned, between protecting an old business and being aggressive about going after new opportunities. But again, going back of the Disney Channel, when you have great programming, you get great ratings, and you're just not that susceptible to the presence of those shows on other platforms.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi.\nJason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I just have a question for Mr. Iger. You made some comments about your expansion to Disney Channel globally. I was just wondering if you could summarize for us where ESPN is today in terms of your global aspirations and where you think it might go.\nRobert A. Iger: ESPN's international business has never been particularly large, nor has it been a huge priority for the company. They have managed to take advantage of certain opportunities, notably through the partnership in Asia with News Corp., in Latin America and selectively in Europe, particularly the U.K. They're going to continue to look at those opportunities with an eye toward determining whether they have the ability to grow or, in some cases, become profitable or, if not, potentially exit those markets. That's not to say they we're going to get out of international, but I think ESPN is likely to be selective about their presence there. It's tough going for them because they're frequently competing with local or locally owned and controlled platform owners that are going after sports almost as loss leaders to drive subscriptions to their platforms. And the absence of us owning true or traditional distribution in these markets, it's kind of tough to be as aggressive buying live sports. So the opportunities for ESPN internationally, I think, are somewhat limited. Not to say that they're -- they don't exist, but it's never going to be a big part of ESPN's business.\nLowell Singer: Thank you, Jason. And thanks again, everyone, for joining us today.

My name is Melanie, and I'll be your coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's meeting will be recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\nLowell Singer: Okay, thanks, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Walt Disney Company First Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued about 45 minutes ago. It's now available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. After the call, a replay and a transcript of today's remarks will also be available on our website.  Joining me in Burbank today are Bob Iger, Disney's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob will lead off followed by Jay, and then of course we'll be happy to take your questions. So with that, I will turn the call over to Bob, and we'll get started.\nRobert A. Iger: Thank you, Lowell. Good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results were driven by strong performances from many of our businesses, particularly, Cable Networks and Parks and Resorts. And EPS of $0.80 for the first quarter was up 18% from last year. Our results reflect the benefits of our ongoing strategy to invest in and leverage our core brands, Disney, Pixar, Marvel, ESPN and ABC, underscoring our consistent focus on creating high-quality entertainment experiences through the use of innovative technology across our businesses and around the globe. Since our last earnings report, a lot has transpired. We launched an over-the-air Disney Channel in Russia; we successfully acquired control of UTV, a leading movie and television company in India; we made a lot of progress in the design and early construction of Shanghai Disneyland; our fourth cruise ship, the Disney Fantasy, completed sea trials in the North Atlantic; 2 of the films we distributed were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture; the Disney Channel has the top 5 shows for kids; and we announced the landmark agreement with Comcast for the distribution of all of our program channels. I'd like to start by explaining why the Comcast agreement will be significant. As you all know, we own and program some of the best and most watched and most valuable channels in the business, all branded Disney, ABC or ESPN. These channels have delivered great value to us, to consumers and to distributors, and over the years, we've successfully invested more capital to enhance their value. And this new deal not only provides for distribution into the next decade, but the rates that we will be paid reflect the increased value we're now providing.  The multichannel business model is extremely important to us and to others in the business. And as new choices to distribute and consume content proliferate, we thought it was vital for us to accomplish 3 things: allow more consumers access to our programs and channels on new devices, including mobile, desktop and laptop; protect and enhance the value of the multichannel subscription to the distributor by allowing it to sell access to our programs and channels on devices as part of their service and by not allowing access to channels to nonsubscribers; and get paid by the distributor for creating this opportunity. And all 3 were accomplished in this deal, which Comcast and we view as important to us and to our customers. This deal highlighted the value of our television businesses, including our Kids portfolio. And as I mentioned earlier, the Disney Channel has had great success and tremendous ratings growth, driven by the compelling characters and strong storytelling that define the brand and connect with kids, tweens, as well as their families. In an incredibly competitive environment, Disney Channel now has the 5 top series for kids 2 to 11, led by Jesse and Good Luck Charlie. It's been the #1 channel among tweens, 9 to 14, for 21 months in a row, and the top channel for kids 6 to 11 for 9 straight months as well.  Disney XD launched in 2008, and it just returned its most-watched quarter ever with its ratings increasing 11% over the last year. We see Disney XD, with its target audience of boys, as a great opportunity to leverage Marvel characters. And we believe the April 1 launch of the new Marvel Universe programming block will generate even stronger ratings and will become a powerful platform to support and grow the Marvel brand. Disney XD now has 23 existing channels and program blocks around the world and will add Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia. Our newest kids brand, Disney Junior., also posted record ratings, with 24% increase year-over-year as preschool viewers tuned in to a programming block of original series like Jake and the Neverland Pirates and the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, which are now the top 2 cable programs among preschool boys. Given its growing popularity, we also believe Jake and the Neverland Pirates has significant franchise potential, joining our list of successful franchises including Phineas and Ferb. Since introducing the Disney, Jr. brand a year ago, we've successfully launched 28 standalone channels and branded programming blocks around the world, and we'll launch a 24-hour channel to 30 million U.S. homes next month. To date, we've launched more than 100 kids channels around the world, including Disney Channel, Disney XD and Disney Junior, and our kids portfolio is a key component of our company's global growth strategy, especially in emerging markets.  We're encouraged by the initial success of our newest Disney Channel in Russia launched just 5 weeks ago and the recent addition of Turkey. In the last 3 years, our reach across European, Middle Eastern and African markets has tripled to more than 100 million households.  The combination of strong programming and far greater distribution has elevated the Disney Channel business to incredible importance and value for the company, helping to drive strong financial results and amazing brand-building momentum. Some additional highlights from our Media Networks. ESPN's Monday Night Football was the most-watched series on cable for the sixth consecutive year. And although the football season is over, ESPN makes great use of those additional rights that it acquired in our recent NFL contract extension and runs NFL-related programming on a year-round basis. ESPN continues to lead on digital platforms and has been the #1 sports destination on mobile devices since 2007, while online at ESPN.com, it has captured more of fans' time than any other sport site for 16 consecutive months. And at ABC, Revenge and Once Upon a Time, our 2 new fall dramas, continue to be hits for the network, and ratings increased for the second year in a row for our Wednesday night comedy block, led, of course, by the multi-award-winning Modern Family. Several promising ABC shows premiere in the coming weeks, including Missing, Scandal and GCB, and tonight is the debut of the spellbinding new drama The River. Earlier, I mentioned UTV, and last week marked a major step in our India expansion with our acquisition of a controlling interest in UTV, India's premier media and entertainment company. By combining our existing businesses in India with UTV, we'll be a leading film studio and TV programmer, with 9 separate channels, including Disney Channel, which is #1 with kids in the country. The UTV acquisition will allow us to more effectively build, monetize and brand local and Disney franchises, and create content for the world's second-largest population. And one of the exciting opportunities for us in India is the absence of a strong family entertainment brand in that country, and our goal is to make Disney the #1 family entertainment brand in India, something we've accomplish over the years in so many markets around the world. Turning to Parks and Resorts. I'm very pleased with recent attendance and pricing trends. Disneyland Resort has seen strong results lately due in part to the strategic investment we made at Disney's California Adventure. We've already opened some attractions as part of the expansion plan, but the largest and most exciting part of this expansion has yet to open, and that's Cars Land. This brand-new 12-acre land with 3 attractions set in Radiator Springs will open in June.  Hong Kong Disneyland had a very good quarter as well, with its recently unveiled Toy Story Land, the first of 3 new themed areas to open as part of its expansion.  Setting sail next month is the Disney Fantasy, the sister ship to the popular Disney Dream, expanding our fleet to 4 and allowing Disney Cruise Line to significantly increase the number of destinations around the world. And as I also mentioned earlier, we're really pleased that construction at Shanghai Disney Resort is well underway at the 963-acre site. And just looking at the model of this vast new resort has us all very excited about its prospects. Turning to the Studio, our key upcoming titles are John Carter, an epic live-action adventure from Director Andrew Stanton of Pixar, Marvel's much anticipated The Avengers, which will be the first Marvel film marketed and distributed by Disney, Disney-Pixar's Brave, about a feisty heroine's adventure in the Scottish Highlands. And then later this year, we have Tim Burton's Frankenweenie and Disney Animation's Wreck-It Ralph. And those are both in fiscal 2013. Also in 2013, our tentpole releases are Oz, Iron Man 3, the Lone Ranger and Monsters University, the sequel to the very successful Monsters, Inc. As an extension of our new Consumer Products business, Disney's baby initiative, we launched disneybaby.com last month, creating a new destination for parents to connect and share experiences with each other. I'm also proud to say that in December, we had record-breaking traffic across all Disney-branded online sites, and our popular mobile game Where's My Water? has now reached the top of the charts in 71 different countries, including currently in the U.S. and while Gardens of Time was named the most popular social game on Facebook. In closing, we had a great start to the fiscal year, executing on our ongoing strategy, driving more and more value from our brands, Disney, Pixar, Marvel ESPN and ABC in the U.S. and around the globe. And we're confident that our commitment to creating and providing exceptional family entertainment on multiple platforms continues to position us to create long-term shareholder value. And with that, I thank you, and turn the call over to Jay Rasulo.\nJames A. Rasulo: Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal 2012 is off to a great start, as evidenced by the strong financial results we delivered during the quarter. These results follow on the back of record revenue net income and earnings per share we delivered in 2011.  I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing the first quarter in more detail and then highlight some factors that may influence our upcoming performance. Operating income for the quarter was up 11% on revenue growth of 1%. Excluding Studio, revenue would've been up more than 4%. I mention this because as you know, the Studio has pursued a strategy of reducing production output and focusing on improving returns on invested capital rather than growing revenue. Our Q1 results reflect this strategy.  In the first quarter, Media Networks was once again the largest contributor to our performance, led by Cable Networks, where operating income growth was driven by ESPN and the worldwide Disney Channel. ESPN's growth was due to higher affiliate revenue related to both higher rates and lower revenue deferrals compared to the prior year. We deferred $76 million less in revenue during Q1, primarily as a result of our new affiliate agreement with Comcast. As a result of this agreement, ESPN will no longer defer Comcast affiliate revenue during the year. We expect ESPN will defer approximately $70 million less in revenue during the second quarter than in prior year. I remind you that the change in ESPN's revenue recognition related to Comcast has no impact on full year results. ESPN's advertising revenue in Q1 was comparable to the prior year, but up 8% after adjusting for the timing of the Rose and Fiesta Bowls and the impact of the NBA lockout.  If you recall, the Rose and Fiesta Bowls aired during our first quarter last year, but those games fell in our second quarter this year. Also due to the NBA lockout, ESPN aired 29 fewer NBA games during Q1 compared to last year. ESPN will air more NBA games during the second and third fiscal quarters compared to last year, so the full year total will not change. So far this quarter, ESPN ad sales are pacing up single digits after adjusting for the benefit of the Rose and Fiesta Bowls. We are quite pleased with ESPN's current ad momentum, particularly given that ad revenue was up 23% during the second quarter last year after adjusting for the benefit of ESPN's first airing of the BCS. Growth at the worldwide Disney Channel was due to increased advertising and affiliate revenue, partially offset by higher programming and production costs. We continued to enjoy strong advertising momentum at ABC Family during the quarter, with ad revenue up 10%. So far during the second quarter, ABC Family ad sales are pacing up double digits.  At Broadcasting, operating income was lower in the quarter as a result of decreased political ad revenue at our owned TV stations, partially offset by lower programming and production costs. Marketing spending at the ABC Network was higher in the quarter, reflecting support for several new primetime shows launched in Q1, including Revenge and Once Upon a Time. Both of these ABC Studios-produced shows are off to great starts. Ad revenue at the stations was down 20% in the quarter. Excluding political advertising and the Flint and Toledo stations, which were sold in Q3 last year, ad revenue was up 3%. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was comparable to the prior year. Quarter to date, scatter pricing at the ABC network is running mid-teen percentage points above upfront levels. Q2 TV station ad sales are pacing down single digits. We are pleased with our strong -- continued strong results at Parks and Resorts. Revenue for the quarter was up 10% and operating income was up 18%. The growth in operating income was the result of higher guest spending and attendance at our domestic parks and higher passenger cruise days driven by the Disney Dream, partially offset by higher costs. Total segment margins were up 120 basis points in the first quarter versus last year's Q1.  For the quarter, attendance at our domestic parks was up 3% and per capita spending was up 8% on higher ticket prices and food and beverage spending. Average per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 6% while occupancy was flat. The increase in per room spending was driven by higher pricing and a reduction of promotional room nights. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up mid-single digits compared to prior-year levels, while book rates are also up mid-single digits. Our first quarter results and the trends we are seeing so far in the second quarter are further evidence that our strategy of returning pricing to more normal levels without sacrificing volume continues to pay off. At our International Parks and Resorts, operating income at Hong Kong Disneyland was higher due to increased guest spending and higher attendance. Operating income at Disneyland Paris was lower due to higher costs and the absence of a real estate sales that took place in Q1 of last year.  As I mentioned earlier, Studio Entertainment revenue decline compared to prior year. This decline was primarily due to the release of fewer Disney-produced titles compared to last year and higher worldwide box office performances of Tangled and Tron in Q1 last year compared to the Muppets this year. However, Studio operating income was higher in the quarter due to lower marketing, distribution and production costs associated with the release of these films. At Consumer Products, operating income for the quarter was comparable to prior year. Merchandise, licensing earned revenue was in line with prior year as higher sales of Cars merchandise was largely offset by lower sales of Toy Story merchandise.  At the Interactive Media segment, operating losses increased from the prior year due to the lower performance of our console game business, but partially offset by higher operating income from social games. The decline in console games was due to fewer titles being released this quarter compared to last year, as well as lower performance of Disney Universe in Q1 compared to the very successful Epic Mickey last year. Higher operating income at social games was due to lower impact of purchase accounting for Playdom, as well as improved game performance driven by higher revenue from Gardens of Time. Now let me turn to the second quarter. We'll continue to invest in successful initiatives that strengthen and extend our brands. In 2011, ABC Family's ratings grew for the eighth consecutive year, and ABC Family ranked as a top cable network for the third consecutive year in total viewers in adults 18 to 49. During Q2, ABC Family will air approximately 20 additional hours of original programming, which will further strengthen its lineup of shows and extend ABC Family's popularity with millennial viewers. These additional hours of programming will result in approximately $35 billion of incremental programming and marketing expense in the quarter.  As Bob mentioned, we continue to expand the geographic footprint and reach of the Disney brand. In March, we will launch a new broadcast satellite channel in Japan targeting women and families. We expect to invest $35 million behind this initiative during the remainder of the fiscal year with approximately half of that falling in Q2.  At Parks and Resorts, we will launch the Disney Fantasy at the end of the second quarter, whereas the Disney Dream launched in late January last year. As a result, we expect to incur preopening expenses in the second quarter related to the launch of the Fantasy, but the ship will not generate meaningful revenue until Q3. While all of these investments will drive incremental expenses during the second quarter, we're confident in our ability to generate attractive returns on these investments. We continue to repurchase our stock -- continued to repurchase our stock during the first quarter by buying back 23.3 million shares for about $800 million, which is consistent with the pace during the first quarter last year. Fiscal year to date, we have repurchased 33 million shares for $1.2 billion.  We feel great about the start of the fiscal year and look forward to continuing to execute on our strategic and financial objectives, and delivering strong performance for our shareholders during the rest of fiscal 2012. With that, we turn the call over to Lowell for questions\nLowell Singer: Okay, thanks, Jay. Operator, we are ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.\nDouglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I was just curious, Bob, given the affiliate revenue growth rate for the #1 pay distributor on ESPN and the cost growth for the most expensive sports program that you have, the NFL, and both are long-term deals. Is it fair to say that you have increased comfort in the ability for ESPN to continue to expand margins over time? And if I could just throw a quick one for Jay. Are you willing to size CapEx for fiscal '12 at this point, given we're through the first quarter?\nRobert A. Iger: The answer to your question, Doug, is yes. Jay?\nJames A. Rasulo: Okay, so parks CapEx. So we've been saying for quite some time, Doug, that fiscal '12 will be the high point of our capital expenditure over the, sort of, relevant range. So you know where we were in fiscal '11. Fiscal '12 is a little bit higher in the multi-hundreds of millions of dollars. I don't want to give you an estimate yet after only the first quarter in terms of what that number will precisely wind up being by fiscal '12. But it'll be a few hundred million higher than it was in fiscal '11\nDouglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And I know I'm pinning you down a little bit here, but in terms of seasonality the rest of the year, is fiscal 2Q a big number because of the rest of the ship or is it later in the year?\nJames A. Rasulo: Yes. The ship is the single biggest investment that we'll hit in Q2 for the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with Nomura.\nMichael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Have a couple of housekeeping ones for Jay. Jay, first, on cable revenues, if you backed out the benefit of those deferrals this quarter, what is normalized affiliate fee growth for the first quarter?\nJames A. Rasulo: Okay. The number you'll see reported in the Q, which is the total cable segment, will be 11%. But I want to give you a little more insight to your question, particularly regarding ESPN. So because of that $76 million referral, we will see affiliate -- reported affiliate fee growth in the mid-teens. But when you adjust it for that deferral issue, we'll still be at the adjusted level in the high single digits for affiliate fee growth.\nMichael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Okay, then let me just turn to cost because you have the same issue on cable network cost comparability because of the BCS and NBA. So the question we have is, if you're just looking at apples-to-apples in this quarter, adjusting for NBA and BCS, what is the run rate for cable network cost right now in first quarter? Is that a good growth rate for the year? So how do you look at apples-to-apples for the first quarter?\nJames A. Rasulo: Yes. So you're absolutely right in your analysis that because the Fiesta and Rose Bowls kicked over into Q2 and because of the NBA lockout, you do see, sort of, an artificial growth rate in our cost at ESPN artificially low for the quarter. If you adjust those things out and look at the other increases that will, what I would say, are more organic, the cable growth was about 7% in Q1 in terms of costs for ESPN.\nRobert A. Iger: This is Bob. Just one thing I wanted to make sure you understand. The quarter we just announced, other than the deferral that Jay talked about, does not have any additional rates in it from the new Comcast deal. So those rates will start kicking in over the next few years. And obviously, that will have an impact on our affiliate revenue going forward since this was mentioned earlier they're the largest distributor out there. But this quarter that we just announced does not have new Comcast rates in it.\nJames A. Rasulo: Okay, and the 7% for Q1 is a reasonably good proxy for 2012.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.\nSpencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: I have a 2-part question on the Studio business. First, for Bob. I was wondering if you could just update us on your thoughts with respect to KeyChest, and if you're planning on just going with that, would you also consider supporting UltraViolet? And then for Jay on the housekeeping side, the Studio margin is, I think, north of 25%, I don't recall them ever being that high in a given quarter. So could you maybe size for us the benefit from lower film write-downs so we can get a sense of the normalized margin at Studio?\nRobert A. Iger: Spencer, we still think that it would be a smart thing to offer consumers greater interoperability for the obvious reason, because it would increase the price to value relationship that they'd be getting when they bought either physical goods or digital goods.  We haven't rolled out KeyChest as extensively as we hoped that we would at this point. We're in pretty significant discussions with a number of entities as we have been for a while, but there's nothing really further to report on that. I don't want to sound too critical, but we're taking a wait-and-see approach on UltraViolet. I'm not suggesting that we're not open minded about it, but so far, I'm not sure that it's proven to be as robust as we'd expected or as consumer friendly as we had hoped. Again that's not to say that we wouldn't necessarily consider it, but it's way too early to conclude that.\nJames A. Rasulo: The second half of your question, so the bulk of the margin improvement was really due to the factors we cited upfront, which were the lower marketing, distribution and production costs in the quarter. But since you asked, the impairment delta was $13 million for the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: My question is on the Parks business. Is there any sense of how much of the, sort of, launch costs or expenses associated with your new investments this year really fell into the fiscal first quarter? And do you still assume that the revenues associated with these new investments will be offset by these expenses this year?\nJames A. Rasulo: So let me answer the second part of your question first because of magnitude. Yes, we still believe that the new initiative revenues will largely be offset by cost, new costs in -- for the entire fiscal year. And I've mentioned that before that we were looking at about $500 million of additional revenue, which would be largely offset by launch costs, training costs, all the things that go into launching those businesses. In terms of Cruise, Alexia, it was not a really significant difference in the number. It's about $7 million or $8 million difference from what we recognized last year. But understanding that the timing of the launch of the Fantasy is later than the timing of the launch of the Dream, there would be more costs in Q2. Sort of in total, they're about the same, but it's more switched into Q2 than Q1 versus those costs for the Dream. And as I mentioned on a few calls ago, we're talking in the tens of millions for the launch costs associated here and nowhere near triple digits on the lower end of the tens of millions.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And just a second question, if I could squeeze it in. Now with the Comcast deal behind you, is it safe to assume that the affiliate growth rates should pick up in fiscal 2013? And any sense on how many subs you have up for renewal for the next few years?\nRobert A. Iger: The answer is yes. Affiliate revenue will kick up, not only due to the Comcast deal, but due to other deals that will be negotiated in the ensuing years. One of the things that is of interest to us is the fact that by offering Comcast and its subscribers authentication or the ability to watch all of these services, every one of the services on mobile devices and computers is clearly something that other distributors would like to be able to offer their consumers. And other than the deal that we did with Time Warner for ESPN, and the deal that we did with Verizon and a few other smaller distributors, we haven't done deals that allow that. So DIRECTV, Cablevision and others are -- and Time Warner because all they got was the rights to do that for ESPN. Those will all start kicking in, we anticipate, relatively soon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Bob, I want to come back to the Comcast contract also because it was something you obviously highlighted in your opening remarks. One of the big discussion topics over the last couple of months has been tiering of sports and sports costs as a major issue for the multichannel video providers. I believe Comcast has an Xfinity sports package or tier. Is there any additional flexibility for them in this new contract? And how do you sort of square that with how you think about ESPN's revenue growth and making sure you're fully distributed across as many subscribers as possible?\nRobert A. Iger: First of all, they've always had that flexibility, but they haven't had that much interest. I'm assuming either they themselves haven't had it or they haven't had it from their customers. And so ESPN has remained basically on a highly distributed tier, not just with Comcast, but across the industry. Now there's so much that's been said about cord cutting and cord slicing and a la carte packages. I think it's just important to emphasize a couple of points about that again. First, I'll start with ESPN. I think they've now gotten to a point because of their popularity and the quality of what they offer, they almost transcend sports. They offer news, stories that are of interest nationally and locally, they program 6,400 hours of live and original programming a year, 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. Their ratings double the combination of all the RSNs in markets as a -- for instance. And I just think, generally speaking, not only are they popular, but they've gotten into that virtual must-have category. Now we don't take that for granted. But because of their position and because of not just their popularity, but almost the value that they now supply both to the distributor and to the customer, we don't really see either a la carte offerings or cord splicing -- or slicing I guess, I should say, as a trend. The only thing I want to say about a la carte and I'll say it -- I've said it a few times, is that I think people want variety, and they're getting it today, and they're also getting substantially increased quality. I've said this before, but for $60, which is the average cost of the expanded basic service, consumers get about 100 channels of programming. Those channels, ours and others, have put billions of dollars into programming over the years, so that the product is a lot better. And if suddenly, they were able to buy these channels on an a la carte basis, we know what would happen. First of all, there would be channels that are of interest to a lot of different entities, in some cases, niche channels, that would simply go away. And I don't think that would necessarily be good. Secondly, the channels that were left would see decreased distribution, decreased ratings, decreased advertising revenue, and that will put a lot of pressure on the rates that they charge. So the rates would go up. The result would be that consumers would be spending more per channel, and it's quite possible that the $60 100-channel package would quickly become a $60 50-channel package. And I don't think that's necessarily good. So I think that's one of the reasons why we're not seeing some great interest in cord cutting because I think, generally, consumers are happy with the quality and the variety that they're getting, and the price-to-value relationship is generally good.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Great. And just as a follow-up...\nJames A. Rasulo: And I just want to add one thing to what Bob said that might have been a little bit -- I just want to make sure you understood this. The MVPDs have always had the opportunity to offer small packages. What they don't have is the opportunity to offer ESPN on small packages. The deal basically requires that ESPN be offered on the first or second most popular tier offered by the carrier.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got it.\nRobert A. Iger: And by the way, I was answering the small package question as opposed to the ESPN. I went online yesterday to a local cable operator's site just because I was curious. And I tried to order a small package, and I couldn't find it. And my guess is that they are not marketing it very aggressively because it's not, one, not all that attractive to their customers and, two, not all that attractive to them.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got it. If I could just quickly ask a follow-up on the film side again. Maybe for Jay. If I look at -- I know it's dangerous looking at any given quarter because of all the moving pieces, but your expenses were down about $350 million year-over-year Q1 to Q1 in film. Is any of that, sort of, recurring structural reductions in overhead or distribution costs? Or is it all variable with the, sort of, P&A of the films in the quarter? Because I think growing studio earnings over time seems to be as much a cost game as a revenue gain from here.\nJames A. Rasulo: Well, I think we've warned you guys and ladies talking about our new film strategy, which is really focused on a smaller number of films, mostly franchise supportive, under either Disney, Disney-Pixar or Marvel labels. And with that, I would answer your question this way: We are very focused on rightsizing our Studio behind our new strategy. The reductions in costs that you see this quarter are largely related to reductions in cost from a smaller slate. But as we continue to move forward and continue to exercise around that new strategy, we will rightsize the Studio. So it's not -- I'm not saying yes and I'm not saying no in answer to your question, I realize that, but accept the fact that if we continue to have quarters and continue where we have lower film releases, years that we have lower film releases, that some of the things that you're seeing in Q1 of this year will de facto become permanent cost savings for the Studio.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I have 2 topics. The first one is on advertising. I know you made some comments on fiscal Q2, and I was just wondering if you could give us some indications on fiscal Q3. Have you seen cancellation options? Can you say what you're seeing cancellation options at the network and any indications of scatter?\nRobert A. Iger: Option pickups have been great. And, Jay, do you comment about scatter -- scatter pricing has been very strong, both at ABC and at ESPN. The trends that we're seeing in advertising are good. We sold out the Academy Awards, I think, about a week ago. We've actually heard recently there's demand for even more spots than were allowed in the contract. And ESPN has seen some real strength in the last month, and their ratings, the NBA now that it's back, are up just under 40%, and there's real demand there. So I'd say the advertising marketplace is healthy.\nJessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Great. And then the other topic is just kind of the recent news events, and there were 2. One is kind of the -- I don't know if you'd call it announcement or pre-announcement by Verizon and Redbox. How do you think about the windows and pricing for the service, the services, kind of, discussing? And the second thing is there's -- today there were a lot of reports about your interest in starting a Spanish language news network with Univision. I was wondering whether you will or won't? Can you talk about the, kind of, the strategic -- how you view that strategically, what you could contribute whether it's newsgathering, what the upside might be? How do you think about that?\nRobert A. Iger: I read -- I know this sounds stupid here, but why not -- I read the Verizon Redbox article about 4x, and I even turned it upside down and sideways, and I'm still not 100% sure I understand what they're offering. But my sense is that it's going to be another opportunity for us to sell content to the marketplace. That it's another entity that will be looking for high-quality branded content. As to -- I think what was hidden or maybe not in your question about how we're looking at Redbox and a lot of these services, we are in discussions to go to the 28-day window to not make -- to not sell directly our physical goods to these entities unless they adhere to a 28-day window. Obviously, because of the first-sale doctrine, they would have an ability to buy those goods from normal retailers. But rather than us being part of that sale and in protection of the sell-through window, we feel that, that would be a wise thing for us to do. I'm not, obviously, as you anticipated, Jessica, going to comment about the Univision article that came out yesterday.  I've said before that ABC has a platform that we continue to invest in from a content perspective. And ABC News is a very important part of that platform. And we have an interest in seeing that ABC News continues to flourish and giving it an opportunity to look for and create some growth opportunities on its own.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Morris with Davenport.\nMichael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division: Two questions. First, I believe that you have a pretty sizable expansion of your value-priced rooms in Florida coming up later this year. And if you -- can you speak a bit more broadly about why value priced? How we should think about the impact that, that will have on your economics and everything from occupancy to the ability to push more people through the parks? First of all. And then second of all, topic we've discussed in the past, but any update on your, sort of, position towards the use of leverage? Obviously, last fall, you were able to borrow incredibly cheaply. You still, relatively, have a low level of debt financing relative to your peers. And given some of your CapEx and the fact that you have such great subscription fees coming in, what's the philosophy there?\nRobert A. Iger: We are -- you're correct, Michael. We're opening the Art of Animation Resort. Actually, it's opening in waves. And most of what we're opening are family suites, where we've seen a real demand in the marketplace. We actually converted some of our space in some of our other hotels to family suites. And we will be opening different parts of this hotel over the next year, year and a half, most of which will be in the family suite category. And to put that in perspective, I don't have the pricing in front of me directly, but my recollection is that we're selling family suites for somewhere in the neighborhood of $200 to $225 a night. These have been very, very popular in the marketplace, and we thought we wanted to expand. Obviously, a family suite is designed to accommodate an entire family. And for that price, we think that this is -- it's right to call this a value room or a value accommodation. We've seen a fair amount of demand in this space over the last 5 or so years, actually probably longer. As we've said before, if you look at our profile, particularly in Florida, we have many more value-priced keys, rooms and suites available today. About 40% of our total fit into that category as of the first quarter that we just announced. Obviously, when we open this new resort, which is very, very large, that number's going to grow somewhat. I think it reflects what's going on in the marketplace in some respects, but it also reflects the popularity of our product and the fact that we're now making it more accessible to more people because of the affordability factor. And for people to be able to come and stay in a room like the ones that we're building for that price is a pretty good deal. Do you want to answer the second?\nJames A. Rasulo: Yes. Mike, relative to your leverage question. So you're absolutely right in stating that we have been through the market multiple times in the past year. I want to add, because I'm very proud of it and proud of our team, but for what we borrowed, in both the amounts and our rating, we really, almost always in the past year, saw historically low coupon rates on that debt. And whereas a couple have been better since then, I think we've timed our steps into the debt marketplace very carefully and put a lot of time into picking what we think would be low entry points, and we've been very successful in doing that. In doing so, we've obviously increased our debt because of the availability of money at these great rates. But I think that one of the reasons why we kind of punched beyond our weight in the debt market is because we have been so strategic and so public and so consistent in wanting to keep a A rating as -- on our balance sheet and go to the market with that consistent message. We have no intention at the current time to change that. There is some -- we can continue to leverage up somewhat and stay below that sort of 2.0 gross debt ratio that will keep us at that A, and we won't push ourselves beyond that. I think there's a little more capacity when we see opportunities to step out. Again, we've got a couple of maturities that we'd like to fill in. And when they see the opportunity to step in at great rates, I think you'll see us doing that. Of course, as time passes, will have some maturities that will refill. But don't expect us to back the truck up to the point where we have to give up that great balance sheet and great Standard & Poor's rating that has, I think, served us incredibly well over the past decade, including when liquidity dried up for most companies in 2008.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi.\nJason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I just have a question for Mr. Iger. I think was a year ago when you talked about the Interactive division at your Investor Day. There was a lot of discussion on cost containment and driving that division towards EBIT breakeven. Can you share any color in terms of, sort of, the reasonable timing to, sort of, glide into a breakeven number at Interactive?\nRobert A. Iger: We are working toward, actually, not breaking even, but making money in fiscal 2013. And when the results of this full year is in, we believe we will have taken a big step in that direction.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vasily Karasyov with Susquehanna.\nVasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I have a question for Jay. Jay, you mentioned that you now have -- you mentioned recently you have now approximately 100 international channels. So could you provide us with some color as to when you expect them to start contributing meaningfully to the Cable Network segment profitability, and how that can evolve over time? Is it going to be like what News Corp. is now seeing or other even Discovery?\nRobert A. Iger: Some of those channels start contributing straight out-of-the-box as soon as we launch them. Some have a different trajectory, all, in sum total, are contributing obviously to the growth of the Disney Channel and our company and will continue to do so. But I think that we can't forget that the power of this channel expansion is not just financial. And to look at it that way, I think, would miss, sort of, a key leg of our strategy. We know from research that the Disney Channel is now the strongest brand driver of the Disney brand in most countries in the world. And as such, we try to get that channel in front of more and more people, which explains why we did the Russian free-to-air joint venture, why we moved from premium to free-to-air and a much broader distribution in Spain and France last year, why we've launched in Turkey. This is a great entry point for people into the Disney franchise. The Disney Channel is a franchise builder. It's a Disney brand builder. And so the combination of both, its financial contribution to the company and strategic leverage that we draft off of in everything that we do around the world makes those investments really payback multifold.\nVasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Do you think 100 channels is the number where you will probably stop pushing for expansion, or is the number going to go...\nRobert A. Iger: Unlikely. Unlikely we'll stop at 100. Because you know now in the U.S., we've got the Disney Channel, the core Disney Channel, launching Disney Junior as its own channel. XD is gaining momentum, and of course, not all of those markets have all of those Disney Channel offerings. So we will continue to introduce those over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Miller with Caris & Company.\nDavid W. Miller - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: Two questions, one for Bob and one for Jay. Jay, just real quickly, what was the ESPN affiliate gross percentage in the quarter? I didn't hear you say that in your prepared remarks, apologize if I missed it. And then Bob, I know you can't talk specifically about any sort of Disney/Univision joint venture on the 24-hour channel if in fact you do it. But if you could just answer this from me topically. I mean, if you decide to go forward with something like this, where are we going to put it? I mean, I don't think there's any room on the analog tier. You could certainly go to digital tier. But having covered Univision for so many years, and most of us on the call covered Univision for many years when it was public, I mean, Univision is primarily an over-the-air play, not necessarily a triple play household type situation. I'm wondering if you can reconcile that for us.\nJames A. Rasulo: First, David, in answer to your question, I gave the numbers in answer to Nathanson's question earlier, but I'll repeat them. 14% or mid-teens on a gross basis and high-single digits on an adjusted basis adjusting for the Comcast deal deferral.\nRobert A. Iger: I'm not going to add anything to the discussion about the article that was written yesterday regarding ABC/Univision [ph]. So with all respect, I decline to answer the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi with Standard & Poor's.\nTuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research: I've got one for Jay and one for Bob. So, Jay, can you just give us an idea of what we can expect from new deals with Amazon and Netflix in terms of the lumpiness or linearity of those revenues as they kick in for fiscal '12 and fiscal '13? That would be helpful for modeling. And then for Bob. With regard to your earlier comment that protecting the Pay TV subs was -- is a paramount consideration, and you said also in response to a Verizon Redbox question that you are, it seems, revisiting your day-and-date strategy, is what I got out of it, given the current situation. It wasn't clear to me if that was a result of the Verizon Redbox announcement or why it took you so long to revisit this. I think it's been almost 3 years when a lot of the other studios have been imposing this window. So I wanted to get your sense of how this perhaps might also affect your view of the whole authentication philosophy, which Verizon itself is also a stakeholder. And now they're, kind of, in the streaming side, as well. So how do you balance all of these interests?\nRobert A. Iger: I'll take it first, Jay, otherwise I'll forget it. There was no connection between the announcement that was made yesterday and the decision by the Studio, which was made by the Studio, to go to the 28-day window. The reason they hadn't gone to that window before is the Studio felt that it was not seeing any affect from these dollar rentals on their sell-through business. And it was their feeling that if they went to that model, it really wasn't -- there would be nothing to be gained from it. In fact they thought they actually might lose some. They have taken a hard look at the business overall. I'd say that the industry has continued to suffer on the sell-through side. And the sale of goods digitally or the rental side have not made up for enough of that falloff that's across the industry. And so they've decided to take a step in the direction of further protecting the initial window and the sell-through window. The whole issue of authentication is somewhat different or separate from the discussion on windowing, although I understand why you would connect the 2. What authentication is about is we see it as really 2 things. One, it's recognizing the value of the multichannel distribution business model and working to protect it, but also working to enhance it by recognizing the value and the excitement of new technology platforms. And so what this does is it gives people, who have subscribed to those services, the ability to watch these channels and watch these programs in a much more mobile, much more flexible ways on all the new devices. It also does create a window that advantages the subscriber and on, at least, the rental side, disadvantages the nonsubscriber. The nonsubscriber would still be able to buy some of these programs on a sell-through basis digitally, virtually right after they air, but would not be able to gain access to them on a rental or a video D model, unless they're subscribers of the service. And that's obviously designed to protect, again, the business model, while at the same time recognizing the importance of and the potential and the excitement around new technology-driven platforms.\nJames A. Rasulo: In answer to your first question, Tuna, your question a little bit assumed the answer, which is that these deals, because of a couple of different factors, first, they are relatively short term and get renegotiated, which makes the flows from them lumpy in and of itself. But secondly, the revenues in these deals are recognized based on the program availability, which even in the course of a deal over, let's say, 3 years means that the flows are going to be not unpredictable, but lumpy. And we really -- it would be extremely both difficult for us to give you insight into how to think about them on a, if you will, normalized basis because there is no normal. And secondly, we haven't discussed the details of those deals or the numbers around them. So I'm sorry that I can't give you any further guidance there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Janedis with UBS.\nJohn Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Jay, can you update us on what you're seeing from a European bookings perspective at Disney World? And has the length of stay changed? And then from a domestic visitor perspective, are you finding that they're coming or committing earlier given you're promoting less?\nJames A. Rasulo: Let me talk to the first half of your question. So if you look at our 2 domestic destinations, Walt Disney World and Disneyland, relative to the mix of international from prior year happens to be precisely the same. And that -- I've talked for a long time about the quarter-to-quarter swing between 18 and low 20s, and it's in that range.  But in that mix, we are seeing more from -- of an increase and strength, particularly from Brazil and Mexico, and a little bit of weakness in Canada and the U.K., the U.K. being, of course, by far and away our biggest European market. So in answer to your question, I'd have to say European bookings are a little bit down and European visitation is a little bit down. On the other hand, the second half of your question, we've pretty much seen strength across the board. What was the second half of your question?\nJohn Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I think in the past, you'd said that you weren't seeing the length of commitment in terms -- I think it was about 13 weeks ahead.\nJames A. Rasulo: Window. Yes, we explicitly did not see a change in the booking window in this quarter relative to prior. I think I've told you it's been 13 weeks, and that has held solid for the first quarter of the year.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, again, everyone, for joining us today.

My name is Livian, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now like to turn the call over to Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Singer, you may begin.\nLowell Singer : Okay, thanks Levy and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Walt Disney Company\u2019s fourth quarter 2013 earnings call. We issued our press release about 45 minutes ago. It\u2019s now available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today\u2019s call is also being webcast and the webcast and the transcript of the call will also be available on our website. Joining me for today\u2019s call are Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob is going to lead off and then Jay will follow him and then we of course will be happy to take some questions. So, with that, I will turn it over to Bob.\nRobert A. Iger: Thank you, Lowell, and good afternoon everyone. We are very pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter with earnings per share up 13%, primarily driven by growth in our Interactive, Consumer Products, and Parks and Resorts businesses.  Our net income for the quarter also grew by 12% on a strong revenue growth of 7%. I am also happy to report that in fiscal 2013, Disney delivered record revenue, net income and EPS for the third year in a row.  We are also making two other important announcements today. One is that we have set an official release date for Star Wars Episode VII, December 18, 2015. This obviously is one of the most important movies we have in the next few years and we\u2019ve chosen a date we believe will allow the creative team of the Time to make a great film. It\u2019s also the date Avatar opened in 2009. The second announcement is our unprecedented deal to create multiple live action series and a mini series event exclusively for Netflix, beginning in 2015. Under the agreement, Marvel TV in association with ABC Television Studios will develop four serialized programs featuring some of the Marvel\u2019s popular characters; Daredevil, Jessica Johns, Iron Fist and Luke Cage. This original program will run over a multiple years and lead to a Marvel's The Defenders mini-series event that reimagines dream team of heroic characters. Both of today\u2019s announcements underscore the value of two of our major acquisitions Marvel and Lucasfilm. As you know, over the last several of years we\u2019ve made a number of major acquisitions and capital investments to drive growth and create shareholder value, now with some of those investments have been completed and the actuations are fully integrated their positive impact is clear in our results especially in Parks and Resorts.  In its first full year of operations since we open Cars Land and completed the transformation of Disney\u2019s California Adventure, the Disney Land resort delivered record attendance revenue and profitability. Walt Disney World also set new attendance records for the year, driven in part by our historic expansion of Fantasyland which will be completed in 2014. We are beginning construction on an Avatar themed area in Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom and continue our progress towards the full roll out of MyMagic+. International attendance in our domestic parks, also set in all time high in fiscal 2013. Internationally; Tokyo Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland also had record attendance this year. We recently announced that Hong Kong will be home to our first Marvel-themed attraction when the Iron Man experience opens in late 2016. And last month construction on our Shanghai Resort officially went vertical it was a major milestone. And we are on track to open the gates of that spectacular resort just two years from now at the end of 2015. Turning to our Media Networks group, ESPN has been the brand in sports for almost 35 years more than 100 million sports fans connect with ESPN every week for incredible sports contact, content rather. And that connection is strong, the average fans spends about 7 hours a week interacting with the ESPN, it was more then 35,000 hours of sports programming every year. Major long term sports rights locked up for the next decade and unparallel brand strength, we remained confident in ESPN\u2019s value and continued rein as the leader in the sports. In broadcast, we are encouraged by ABC\u2019s start to season and non-sports programming ABC is currently a very close second in both C3 and L7 ratings. The network is some of TVs most DVR shows as well as the number one new show Marvel\u2019s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the fastest growing returning series Scandal. The perennial leader among upscale audiences this season ABC once again leads the other networks in the price demo by double-digits, it\u2019s also the only broadcast network to see it\u2019s audience get younger. We\u2019ve also successfully sold ABC studio shows including S.H.I.E.L.D., Scandal, Revenge and Grey\u2019s Anatomy into more than 100 markets around the world. We continue to generate tremendous value from original Disney content as well, especially in kid\u2019s television businesses. All ten of the top 10 series for Kids 6-11, in Q4 were Disney Channel shows and the channel has been number one among that demo as well as with Tweens 9-14 for 125 consecutive weeks. Disney Junior is another fantastic success story although we just launched the standalone channel here in the U.S. 19 months ago it\u2019s been the number one pre-school channel among Kids 2-5, every single weeks since News On began reporting its ratings back in April. The success of franchises like Sofia the First, Jake and the Never Land Pirates and Doc McStuffins have made Disney Junior an important growth driver for our merchandise licensing business. Retail sales for Disney Junior products exceeded $1.8 billion in fiscal 2013, more than double the year before. And going into the critical holiday season, Disney Junior toys are prominently featured on the retailers hot toy lists and our top four retail partners are planning to double Disney Junior shelf space compared to last year. Retailers are also excited about Disney Infinity this holiday season and so are we. We\u2019ve already sold more than 1 million starter packs globally and the individual figures are also doing extremely well with the most popular ones selling out at major retailers in a matter of days. This successful launch drove Disney Interactive swing profitability in Q4 and all indications suggest the strong demand for Disney Infinity will continue. Turning now to our Studio business with the phenomenal global success of Marvel\u2019s The Avengers and Iron Man 3. Marvel Studios became the first studio in history to release two $1 billion movies in a row. That gives us some incredible momentum going into our next model release, Thor: The Dark World, which has already opened strong in a number of international markets and we\u2019re confident that Thor will do very well when it opens here tonight. We plan to keep the streak of great Marvel movies going with Captain America, The Winter Soldier and Guardians of Galaxy next year and with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on small screens around the world and new Iron Man attraction headed to Hong Kong. And the Netflix deal we announced today, it\u2019s clear our integration of Marvel across our company has been incredibly successful. Through the animations phenomenal greater resurgence continues with Frozen, a new animated musical and the spirit of tangled and the great animated films throughout Disney\u2019s history. Great storytelling, fantastic music and world-class animation, Frozen will join the ranks of the loved Disney characters when it opens at Thanksgiving. Then we\u2019ll end the year with Saving Mr. Banks, a great story starring Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson as Walt Disney and Mary Poppins author P. L. Travers. Next year in addition to the two Marvel movies I mentioned, we\u2019re also looking forward to a new Muppet Caper and Angelina Jolie as Maleficent. And of course we\u2019ve got some huge movies in calendar 2015 with Marvel\u2019s The Avengers, Age of Ultron and Star Wars Episode VII as well as Pixar's Inside Out and The Good Dinosaur. We\u2019re obviously pleased with our performance in fiscal 2013 across The Walt Disney Company from both the creative and financial standpoint. We\u2019re well positioned for continued growth in 2014 and with the slate of blockbuster movies I just mentioned as well as the opening of Shanghai Disneyland. We\u2019ve been more excited about what\u2019s ahead in 2015 and beyond And now, I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Jay for the financial details.\nJames A. Rasulo: Thank you, Bob and good afternoon everyone. Earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $0.77, an increase of 30% over the last year. We are very pleased with our results this quarter, which capped yet another year of strong financial performance. Our fourth quarter and record full year results only again demonstrate the significant benefits we derived and the way we managed the company, which includes aggressive reinvesting in our core businesses, extending our portfolio through prudent M&A and returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders. Operating income at Media Networks was down in the quarter. As a result, the Cable were adversely impacted by the timing of affiliate revenue recognition at ESPN. Broadcasting results were down versus last year. This quarter ESPN recognized $172 million less in previous deferred affiliate revenue than it recognized in the fourth quarter of last year. As a reminder, this issue does not affect full year results. Absent this impact, both Cable revenue and operating income would have been up 6% compared to last year driven by higher operating income at ESPN and the domestic Disney Channels. Excluding the impact of the revenue to deferral ESPN\u2019s operating income would have been up in the quarter due to higher affiliate revenue and increased advertising revenue partially offset by a modest increase in programming costs for College Football, the NFL and the Major League Baseball. Reported cable affiliate revenue was down 3% in the quarter. This decrease was due to the impact of the ESPN\u2019s revenue deferral, business model changes including the sale of the ESPN U.K. business as well as FX. Absent these impacts cable affiliate revenue would have been up high single-digits. For the full year cable affiliate revenue was up 6% on a reported basis and high single digits absent these impacts. Ad revenue at ESPN was up a solid 9% in the quarter due to an increase in unit sold and higher rates. The ESPN\u2019s ratings were up year-over-year driving by College Football, Major League Baseball and the NFL. So far this quarter ESPN\u2019s cash ad sales are pacing up nicely. At broadcasting operating income was down in the quarter due to difficult comps and program sales and higher prime time programming costs which were partially offset by higher ad revenue at the ABC Network.  At the Network programming costs were higher in the quarter because we aired more hours of scripted program in compared to last year, when some prime time hours were dedicated to coverage of the Presidential election. Ad revenue at the Network was up 10% in the quarter as a result of increase in unit sold higher rates and growth in online sales partially offset by lower ratings and the Emmy's rotating from ABC to CBS this year. Quarter-to-date scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running more than 20% above upfront levels. Our parks and resort segment delivered yet another solid quarter of performance. Revenue for the quarter was 8% and operating income was up a solid 15% on the back of continued growth at our domestic parks and resorts and vacations club sales at the Grand Floridian. Result at Disneyland Paris were lower in the quarter. Higher operating income at our domestic parks and resorts was primarily due to increased guest spending, higher attendance and occupied room night at Walt Disney World and a k increase in guest spending at the Disneyland Resort, partially offset by higher costs including on going spending for growth initiatives. For the quarter attendance at our domestic parks was comparable to prior yeah, an increase in attendance at Walt Disney World was offset by a decrease at the Disneyland Resort given the comparisons to last year when there was a surgeon attendance around the opening of Cars Land. Domestic per capita spending was up an impressive 9% on higher ticket prices and food and beverage spending. Average per room spending at our domestic hotel was up 4% compared to prior year and occupancy in the quarter was comparable to prior year redespite an increase in available room nights. So far this quarter domestic resorts reservations are comparable to prior year levels, while book for 5% or 8% versus prior year. We continue to enjoy steady margin improvements as the base business grows and margins begin to reflect the benefit of recent investments. Total reported parks and resort segment margins were up 90 basis points in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. The year-over-year change in Q4 margins was on top of an adverse impact of an estimated 90 basis points due to spending on growth initiatives. For the year margins were up 110 basis points and that was on top of an adverse impact of 30 basis points due to growth initiatives.  At Studio Entertainment, operating income was up due to better worldwide theatrical performance and higher TV distribution results, which were partially offset by higher film cost write-downs and lower operating income from worldwide home entertainment.  Theatrical results improved in the quarter due to strong performance of Monsters University compared to Brave in the same period last year. Film impairments were higher in the quarter, reflecting the impact of our write-down of The Lone Ranger. \n : At Consumer Products, growth in operating income was primarily due to gains in Merchandise Licensing. Results were due to strong demand for a number of our key properties including Planes, Monsters University and Disney Junior. The increase in licensing this quarter also reflects the inclusion of Star Wars results. Licensing revenue was up an impressive 9% in the quarter and that\u2019s on a comparable basis, so it excludes the impact of Star Wars.  At the interactive segment, operating income was up significantly in the quarter through the successful launch of Infinity. Segment results swung from an operating loss in the fourth quarter last year to an operating profit this year. As Bob said, the next test for Infinity will come this holiday season where we feel good about it\u2019s prospects based on sales so far and the feedback we have gotten from retailers, consumers, and hardcore gamers.  During the fourth quarter, we significantly increased our pace of share repurchase by buying 21.8 million shares for about $1.4 billion and for fiscal 2013, we repurchased 71.3 million shares for $4.1 billion.  We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders via share repurchase and dividends. We believe our shares are very attractive at these levels and as we have said, we expect to repurchase between $6 billion and $8 billion in stock during fiscal 2014. So far this year, we have repurchased 15.1 million shares for about $1 billion.  We feel very good about how we are positioned for fiscal 2014, given the underlying trends we are seeing in our business.  Before I conclude, let me proactively address a couple of questions you may have about 2014. We expect total consolidated CapEx in 2014 to be about $1 billion higher than in 2013 with the increase, primarily due to increased investment in Shanghai Disney Resort.  As we have discussed in the past, capital spending for the Shanghai project will ramp meaningfully in 2014 and 2015 as we prepare for the resorts opening in late 2015.  While we fully consolidate all of Shanghai\u2019s CapEx, our net contribution is only 43% of the total CapEx. Thus our CapEx will be up approximately $600 million. Domestic parks CapEx is expected to be essentially flat compared to 2013.  Pension expense is expected to decline in 2014 due to an increase in the discount rate. The lower pension expense will be partially offset by expected adverse impacts from foreign exchanged rates primarily due to a decline in the value of the Japanese yen. We expect the net impact of these two items to through result in a benefit of about $150 million for the year.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Lowell for Q&A.\nLowell Singer: Jay thank you and operator, we are ready for the first question. \nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Alexia, please go ahead. \nAlexia Quadrani \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities LLC: Thank you. Just two quick questions. First, just curious why you chose to put the Marvel movies on the Netflix rather on one of your own platforms like ABC or ABC Family?\nRobert A. Iger: Well, we are already producing Marvel shows for our networks. ABC has S.H.I.E.L.D. and has developed another concept and we have shows on Disney XD. And when we look forward we realize that there were just so many Marvel shows we thought we could actually fit on to those platforms. So we looked at other opportunities. There was a lot of interest from a variety of different distributors, new and traditional platforms and ultimately Netflix won out. They are in the business of creating original programming already. Obviously House of Cards is a great example of that. And we saw a scenario where they were only going to continue to buy more original programming and this seem like a good opportunity for us to provide them with some branded product that they haven\u2019t had access to, except for the programming they get off channel once, in other words after its aired. So good opportunity we thought for them and a great opportunity for us.\nAlexia Quadrani \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities LLC: And just a follow-up question on the domestic part. So I think in the past you\u2019ve sort of called out some incremental expense that we may see on different initiatives. I guess is there something incremental we should look out for in fiscal 2014? I guess where are you on the spending around MyMagic+ and then on MyMagic+ when we might see, I guess some signs or data points and how it\u2019s impacting the business?\nRobert A. Iger: Alexia, let me take the back end of your question, first on MyMagic+. So the situation we\u2019re in right now is that we basically are continuing to roll forward with making this benefit available to more and more of our guests. And at this point if you\u2019re staying on property at one of our hotels, you are basically a beneficiary of MyMagic+. And we\u2019ve talked about the benefits in two basic categories in terms of financials of the company. The first, as it greatly improves the experience at Walt Disney World, we expect that as we have with everything else we\u2019ve done to improve the experience at our parks to have an underlying increase in business, whether that\u2019s more individuals coming to the resort every year or those individuals who comedown to Orlando, spending more time with us and having a better time. That tends to reverberate throughout our business in a very positive way. And then, sort of easing some of the, let\u2019s say, logistics of getting around the property, paying for things, entering the parks, getting in and out of the resort hotels, when you make that easier people tend to spend more time on entertainment and more time on consumables, be that food and beverage, merchandise, et cetera. So as we are still very much in the early days of rollout we haven\u2019t been characterized in that impact, but we do expect this to be a net positive and growing the positive impact on our business in the years to come. Relative to the front end of your question, on continued spending and ramp up of new initiatives in Florida, and that\u2019s not only MyMagic+, which \u2013 the operating portion, of course cost are kicking in and we\u2019re now seeing as we put the assets in place some of the depreciation that comes with that project being reflected in our expenses. But if you look at it on an overall basis, those new initiatives were accretive in 2013. We continue to be accretive in 2014. I said in my comments that the margin impact of that in fiscal 2013 was about 30 basis points on our overall margins and this year we are looking at about a $300 million expense item and more or less the same amount on the revenue side. So we\u2019ll continue to see accretion into 2014 and ramping up beyond that.\nAlexia Quadrani \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities LLC: Thank you very much.\nRobert A. Iger:  You\u2019re welcome.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Alexia. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from Moffett. Michael, please go ahead.\nMichael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson LLC:  Thanks. I have two for Jay, one on CapEx and one on housekeeping. Jay, on CapEx, we thought, and you just said MyMagic+ starts become an operating expense asset. I know you\u2019ve been through building, your hotels and building new attractions. So was the CapEx in domestic business same level? What are you guys now spending it on? So we thought it ramped down a bit this year. So is there anything new project-wise that you guys have not announced yet that will be coming out?\nJames A. Rasulo:  Yes. Michael, we are in the process of finishing up the Fantasyland expansion, not quite done. Of course we\u2019ve got the underlying CapEx that both maintains and adds quality to our existing assets and we are beginning, as we\u2019ve discussed, to spend some capital on AVATAR. And I want to reinforce for all of you that we\u2019ve talked in shorthand frankly about AVATAR and AVATAR Land at Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom. But for purposes of thinking about the economic benefit of this project, you really have to think of AVATAR Land the way we discussed Cars Land in shorthand. That is that Cars Land was part of an overall re-concepting and redelivery of Disney\u2019s California Adventure, which had park-wide benefit in terms of volume and length of stay et cetera. AVATAR Land is playing a similar role in Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom as we are converting that park into a full-day experience that goes into the evening and expect to have impacts on the overall volume and length of stay at that park as we well. So we\u2019ve begun to spend capital on that, both aspects of the specifics of AVATAR Land as well as converting the Animal Kingdom to the point where it can be an evening experience as well as daytime. So the combination of those factors is basically keeping our domestic CapEx equal to what it was last year.\nMichael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson LLC: Okay. And then just on housekeeping. I know you called out the impact on [indiscernible] ESPN U.K. changed for the quarter and for the year. ESPN gets changed I know, but at what point do you think the international affiliate fee growth will start to become less of a drag for you guys because I know just earlier you report one number affiliate fees. So what point you think it\u2019s also a drag internationally?\nJames A. Rasulo: Well, let me hasten to add that the business model change on the ESPN U.K. decision i.e. to exit that business and therefore receive less affiliate fees was accompanied by more than a cost savings for that business and therefore that was a net positive on an OI basis even though it was a negative on international affiliate fees.  And secondly, we've moved to a free-to-air format. Our moving to a free-to-air format in Germany, which has also depressed what we're formally recognized as affiliate fees and will now be realized in the form of advertising. And more importantly in the biggest and wealthiest country in Europe as a brand lifter as the Disney Channel has been all over the world, as it we much, much more broadly distributed free-to-air than it had been in a relatively small Cable channel or with a partner.\nMichael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson LLC:  Okay, thank you.\nRobert A. Iger:  You\u2019re welcome Michael.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Michael. Operator next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank. Doug, please go ahead. \nDoug Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you so much. So Jay, I don't have too much on the park CapEx, but I believe this time last year, you said that the CapEx driven growth initiatives would be breakeven overall in fiscal '13, but would start to drive profitability in 2014 and ultimately achieve double-digit returns and earlier in the call, you indicated that, it turned out there was some profitability in fiscal 2013, but wouldn't improve in fiscal 2014? So, I'm just curious what changed from where we were a year ago and has the return on investment profile, of the growth initiatives changed at all in your mind?\nJames A. Rasulo:  I think if you look at \u2013 so, we said things would be breakeven in fiscal '14 [ph], they were actually a little more accretive than we originally thought at the beginning of the year and they continue to grow in their contribution on the revenue side, but as you can imagine with a project like MyMagic+ which had a very heavy IT investment which depreciates on a much more rapid basis than other normal assets we've put into place in world. We did expect the cost side, to bump up, even though the revenue side from the new initiatives continues to grow. And it really hasn't changed at all our perspective on the returns that we expect either on individually on any of these projects, or in total for the new investment we're putting in to the division. \nDoug Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.:  And then, one for Bob, it might seem like there's a bit of an arms race in terms of Theme Parks with both you and Universal building out more attractions and hotels. Universal obviously now with the backing of Comcast is investing much more aggressively. Do you think there's room in the marketplace for both of you with all of the investments that you're both putting in place? \nRobert A. Iger:  Yes, I do. They, I think they been investing over the years. Universal expanded before Comcast own them. Harry Potter actually was started well before Comcast own them. So do I think that they are going to ramp up substantially? I think the jury is still out, we will see just how much they're willing to invest and what kind of creativity they have to invest in, but yes, there is room in the marketplace. Sure.\nDoug Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.:  Thank you.\nLowell Singer:  Thanks Doug. Operator next question please? \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Cohen from Bank of America. Jessica, please go ahead.  \nJessica Reif-Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: All right, thank you. A couple of questions, I guess starting with China. As you kind of march towards the Shanghai opening in late 2015, can you talk about how you are going to build the Disney brand between now and then? Maybe as once it opens what do you think the halo effect will be on your overall business there?\nRobert A. Iger: Well, we have been building the Disney brand over the years, Jessica, and we\u2019re going to continue to. We\u2019ve had continued growth or presence on television platforms although because of restrictions that is limited. We\u2019ve grown nicely in the mobile space and online and we continue to grow at retail plus we\u2019ve had some real success with some of our feature phones there, particularly as we\u2019ve seen screens grow or the number of screens grow tremendously in China. A lot of the activity though between now and when the park opens will be to grow the theme park brand. To make sure that not only the people know that it\u2019s coming, but to give them a better appreciation for what will be in it, which we\u2019ve not yet announced, but you can expect a lot of kind of making of kind of programming and things that are done in the marketplace that track what attractions will be in the park itself. So if we have a themed attraction based on, say a certain movie then it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll see or the Chinese will see that move in the marketplace in a variety of different ways would be one example. So they can better appreciate the story. We\u2019re also opening or developing our first big store in China and that is actually in Shanghai, which will be used before it opens sort of a quasi visitor center to let people know more about the park itself, and it is in one of the highest traffic areas in Shanghai, just at the foot of the TV tower. Once the park opens we actually believe that we\u2019ll have a significant halo effect on the brand. There will be a lot more interest in and appreciation of Disney stories and characters. And we intend to explore all different avenues to take advantage of that, but we\u2019re right now focused mostly on building a great park and making sure that it is appropriately marketed so that people when they can go can really appreciate the experience better.\nJessica Reif-Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  Thank you. And then the second question, just totally different. But I was wondering if you could comment about what\u2019s going on with Dish. I mean is there something really different this time in terms of rights or is this just short of \u2013 I mean retrans is maybe one issue, but things like the Hopper can you just kind of talk us through what the key issues are or \u2013 in any negotiation because it does seem to be taking longer than normal?\nRobert A. Iger:  Well, first of all we\u2019ve had a productive negotiation and so progress is being made. There are still issues to be resolved and they could take some time, but as long as we\u2019re making progress we are perfectly patient to see this thing through and avoid a blackout sorts of our channels, which we\u2019d like to do. You are right to suggest that this is complicated because these deals have gone well beyond just how many subs they\u2019re going to provide and what fees they are going to pay us. Technology is creating a lot of complexity in terms of what we\u2019re selling to them, in effect what they are buying and ultimately what they can do with the product that we\u2019re making available. We want to make sure that we are open-minded and modern in our approach to recognize all the different changes in the marketplace that enable consumers to have better access to our product, but at the same time we intend to be steadfast in our desire in our strategy to protect the value of our intellectual property. It\u2019s just complicated and right now, the negotiation is more about issues related to technology than related to the more standard issues of basically sub fees and distribution.\nJessica Reif-Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  Thank you.\nLowell Singer:   Thanks, Jessica. Operator next question please.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein, Todd please go ahead.\nTodd Juenger \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC:  Well, hi, thanks. Two, one that picks right up where we just left off. So, you get such intense scrutiny obviously on affiliate fees, and particularly with regards to ESPN. So, you just said how complicated it is. I'm trying to identify any other degrees of variability going forward. It seems like your message is that sort of the normalized growth rate, at least this past year, has been singles of affiliate fees.  We've talked a little bit about the international business change, about some renewals that could have an effect on that rate. Are there any other big material puts and calls that we should be thinking about and one that comes to mind is the WATCH Apps and whether they could influence that track rate?  And then the second sort of housekeeping call, similar on Consumer Products, thanks for getting us the number ex-Lucasfilm for the quarter. Just looking into next year, we have got the Lucasfilm going on but then you also \u2013 your App's in the Pixar movies so just any help you could give in terms of how we should think about the puts and takes on the growth of that business with those two ins and outs?\nRobert A. Iger:   On the ESPN front I think that you are likely to see nothing particularly dramatic to change the trajectory of growths of ESPN over the next five years or so, partially because a lot of our distribution deals are done, as are a lot of our licensing deals for sports rights. We have seen across all of our Media Networks tremendous adoption of our WATCH Apps and significant usage of those apps. And in the deals that we are cutting with distributors we are getting paid so that they can provide access to their subs for mobility or for the WATCH Apps.  In other words TV Everywhere, is something that actually is adding to our subscription revenue because they\u2019re making it available to their customers and it is a rather compelling product because suddenly as you know, Todd, the customer is no longer basically confined to just having watch the multichannel service in the home. They can really watch it everywhere. The number of subs that will have this service and in effect the growth in sub piece from it is only going to continue as we cut more deals with distributors. \n :\nJames A. Rasulo:  On the second half of your question Todd, let me give you some sense of why we are excited about for DCP licensing in the coming year. First of all, just as a matter of fact, we will have three quarters of Lucas in the numbers as opposed to this year, we will have all four quarters versus three quarter, but if you think about on the kinds of properties we will have in the market on the theatrical side, first of all Spiderman will benefit from the Q3 2014 release of it, that\u2019s like in May and we historically and very much expect to see a lift in our license revenue there.  For the slightly younger audience I think we will see both DVD release and in Q4, the second film release of Planes. And Planes has turned out to be an incredible juggernaut on the DCP side with license merchandise because it not only has its own following and its own characters and it\u2019s own new merchandize that it adds to the market, but because it\u2019s from the world of cars, it tends to reinvigorate the interest in those characters as well and [indiscernible] very well in 2014. And for our youngest audience, the Disney Junior properties are absolutely on fire Bob, refer to the ratings and the strength of Disney Junior and whether it\u2019s so Doc McStuffins, Manny, or Jake and the Never Land Pirates they are experiencing double digit growth rate now on the licensing side and we expect that to continue as those franchises are still all relatively new and all very much in the growth stage with the marketplace.  If you went out this year for Halloween, you bump into a lot of little doctors and lot of little pirates and guess what, that\u2019s where kids interest are and therefore, their parents purchases this all.\nTodd Juenger \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Very helpful, thank you Bob.\nLowell Singer: Thanks Todd, operator, next question please.\nOperator:   Our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov from Sterne, Agee. Vasily, please go ahead.\nVasily D. Karasyov \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Thank you, good afternoon. I have a question on the income in the earnings of [indiscernible] for cable. If I am doing my math right, there seems to be a material deceleration quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. So I was wondering what the nature of that is and how representative that will be of the run rate in fiscal 2014?\nRobert A. Iger:  Thanks Vasily for that question. Little bit unusual for A&E where a lot of our income of invest comes from. A&E had a big investment period in the fourth quarter, I don\u2019t see that as typical. If you look at the full year impact of the contribution from A&E, it\u2019s strong, it\u2019s been growing. We expect it to be strong into the future and I\u2019d see Q4 more as an aberration and that is what is driving those numbers. \nVasily D. Karasyov \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: All right, thank you very much.\nRobert A. Iger:  You are welcome. \nLowell Singer:  Thanks Vasily. Operator, next question please.\nOperator:   Our next question comes from Tuna Amobi from S&P Capital IQ. Tuna please go ahead.  \nTuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research:  Thanks a lot. So I guess my first question Bob, could you explain your television station, there has been some reports about potentially selling that, which I was surprised about, given all the talk about retransmission, is there any scenario where that doesn\u2019t become a strategic asset for ABC and separately from your earlier comments regarding the mobile initiatives at ESPN, I was trying to get your thoughts on the monetization of C7 ratings. It almost seems to become a moot point for ESPN, given a) their live viewing of the sports programming, and also b) your integrated multi-platforms sales.  So I am just wondering, if some of your peers have talked about C7 coming to fruition perhaps as early as next year. Do you feel like your less invested at ESPN on that and perhaps going to diverge ABC given your comments that ABC seems to be getting a lot of ratings uplift on the extended view? So I am just kind of trying to put together your strategies there for C7. Is there going to be a divergence versus ESPN and ABC, if that makes sense?\nRobert A. Iger:  Yes. That makes sense. You are right, because most of ESPN's viewing is live. We don't expect much of a lift from a ratings or a revenue perspective for either C3 or C7 for ESPN. By the way on the C7 side, while there has been some, I guess, a couple of deals done on C7, we certainly like to see more because of the significant consumption beyond C3. I'm not sure that's going to happen very quickly. You mentioned a year that sounds aggressive to me. I don't think the advertising market place is going to move that fast.  On the first question, we haven't commented about the station, so your reading was complete speculation from, I can't remember whether it was the press or the investment community, but neither one necessarily reflects the opinion or the attitudes of this Company. These have been good assets for us. They've been run extremely well. They're number one in most of the markets, we only have eight by the way and I think as long as we're in the Network business, we'll be in the station business. We don't comment about acquisitions or divestitures, but I don't think it would be wise to either predict or to conclude that these assets were on the market. \nTuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nLowell Singer:  Thanks, see you now. Operator next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comers from Barton Crockett from FBR Capital Markets. Barton please go ahead.\nBart E. Crockett \u2013 FBR Capital Markets: Okay, thanks for taking the question. I was interested in a little bit more on the Netflix Marvel deal. Do you see this as a platform putting shows on Netflix that could drive enough viewership that it actually could help make these bigger brands from a licensed merchandise perspective in other ways?\nRobert A. Iger: I do. I think that's a good question. Marvel has thousands of characters and it would not have been possible if \u2013 it is not possible to mime them all with filmed entertainments. And in fact, while these characters are attractive characters, they're not among the most popular and they are characters that we probably were never going to make feature films about. Although, if they're popular on Netflix, it's quite possible they could become feature films. So I think that there are a number of ways for Marvel to create more sort of value opportunities or value generating opportunities and this is one of them, and it's also, I think happens, as I mentioned earlier, happens to be great for Netflix.  They're looking to make more original programming. It's branded. There's a huge fan base. I looked today just at comments that were being made about this deal from, I'll call it the Marvel fan base, and other than the chatter about the dating of the Star Wars film, this was among the most talked about step out there today.  Next to of course, I guess the IPO of Twitter. Although the dating of Star Wars was the number one tweeted or trending subject on Twitter today, I thought was also interesting. Anyway, this is, I think, a great opportunity for Marvel to create more brand value and to create more character value and I think it's only one step in a direction that will lead to much more value being mined at Marvel and ultimately, Lucas, there's Star Wars, other ABC production capabilities and of course Disney. There are more opportunities beyond our platforms to produce product for them.\nLowell Singer: \n : \nOperator: Our next question comes from Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo. Marci please go ahead.\nMarci Ryvicker \u2013 Wells Fargo: Thanks. I have two questions Jay. You mentioned Shanghai CapEx for fiscal 2014, which is curious how we should think about operating expenses. And then secondly, the pick-up in the share repurchase activity for this year, should we take this as a signal that there is nothing on the horizon in terms of M&A? Just trying to understand what prompted the change and if this level of share repurchase activity is more of a trend rather than just a one year event?\nJames A. Rasulo: Thanks Marci. So obviously the vast majority of our spending in Shanghai is capitalized and will show up as roughly the 43% of \u2013 roughly $600 million as I mentioned in the comments. On the operating \u2013 but there are operating expenses, you're absolutely right. Those are in round numbers, $100 million, I don\u2019t know if they will wind up being a little less than that, because we tend to plan conservatively and has to do with of course the onboarding of the operating team, the onboarding of the management team, sending a lot of people to our existing Parks to become trainers of future employees kind of in the train the trainer mentality.  And we did that extremely successfully in Hong Kong with a staff that was very unaccustomed to what Disney operations were like. We will do the same thing in Shanghai, actually we have already begun and we will continue to ramp that up. So, on fiscal year 2014 to make a very simple question easy, about $100 million, I'd use that in your thinking. Second part of your question was?\nMarci Ryvicker \u2013 Wells Fargo: In terms of the share repurchase, is that a signal that there is no M&A or something that's going to continue?\nJames A. Rasulo:  No. I would signal that. We have talked about the fact that a lot of these investments that we have put in place would eventually contribute to our cash flow. We see that clearly manifesting itself in our planning in the coming years. And while we are absolutely happy with our single A rating, the strategic position it gives us in the capital markets, we feel that we\u2019ve got the capacity, we had the capacity to increase our return of capital to shareholders.  We are not cash hoarders. But I don't think you should read it as a signal about M&A. Now I am not \u2013 on the other hand I am not trying to signal you that there is something imminent, but on the other hand I wouldn't signal it as, hey, Disney is out of the M&A business, because it has been an incredible, a growth vehicle for the company.  Year in and year out, we have used acquisitions successfully to add to the IP of the company and the distribution capabilities of the company and of course we\u2019re in a dynamic marketplace that we\u2019ve been talking about for call after call and we don\u2019t want to standstill and act as if we have everything in our hand that could potentially continue to grow the company. So I wouldn\u2019t read that either way, but I think we\u2019re a company with incredibly strong balance sheet that has the capacity to both engage in returns to shareholders as well as opportunistic M&A.\nMarci Ryvicker \u2013 Wells Fargo: Great. Thank you so much.\nLowell Singer:  Thanks, Marci. Next question please operator.\nOperator: Jason Bazinet from Citi. Jason, please go ahead.\nJason Bazinet \u2013 Citi: Just another question from Mr. Rasulo, within the Consumer Products segment, at least historically, as far back as I can go with the operating income margins sort of peaked in Q1. This is the first year I can find we are peaked in Q4 and you mentioned a 9% up on licensing ex-Star Wars, but that number doesn't seem, I guess, extraordinary to me when I look at history. So is there anything else going on that's more fundamental that would cause the magnitude of margin expansion and does it foreshadow something structurally different in terms of the margins for this segment? Thanks. \nJames A. Rasulo:  Yes, I would say that your observations are correct. Obviously, the Lucas edition has contributed to margins. We said when we did both the Marvel and Lucas acquisitions that we had the onboard capability to absorb the licensing of those franchises without increases in overhead, which of course, gives you incremental margins that are better than your average margins, but we've also had very significant worldwide improvement in our Disney Store business and you can imagine that when you're looking at the blend of businesses that Consumer Products engages in, both from the licensing side, where margins are enormous, to the retail side, where margins are \u2013 where you know they are in retail, no improvement in that and improves the overall margin. So we're pretty happy with a division that's pretty much firing on all cylinders at this point. I also think that when you consider that we've got Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Lucas products in the marketplace that the scale that that generates, creates margin expansion and general growth opportunities, some of it comes just from gaining access to more shelf space, some of it comes from basically being able to cut better deals as well. It's just a healthy collection of assets that retailers and licensees around the world are really interested in. \nJason Bazinet \u2013 Citi:  That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nLowell Singer:  Thanks, Jason. Operator, the next question please.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Vijay Jayant from ISI Group. Vijay, please go ahead.\nDavid Joyce \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group:  Thank you. This is David Joyce for Vijay. In thinking about the longer-term free cash flow generation and capital returns for the company, we are trying to contemplate the capital expenditure profile past 2015 and in particular given that the Disney cruise ships are so successful and they are booked the year in advance and they are at industry leading load factors. When would you decide if you need to add to the fleets? Say there is obviously a need for a long lead time there. Thanks. \nRobert A. Iger:  We are not currently contemplating adding to the fleet, Vijay. We like the itineraries that are available to us. We have had a number of conversations about potential itinerary expansion and frankly given the business that we're in or the aspect of the business that we're in, the opportunities are not that numerous. I think eventually Asia will open up to the cruise business, but when it opens up to the family cruise business we are still unsure of and my guess is that it won't open up in the very near term.  So yes, we are not really at the moment contemplating adding to our fleet. We think that we have some interesting opportunities to expand the itineraries of our current four ship fleet but we are not going to need a fifth ship to take advantage of flow of itinerary opportunities for a while.\nDavid Joyce \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group:  All right thank you.\nLowell Singer:\n : Okay, operator we have time for one more question.\nOperator:  And our next question comes from Alan Gould from EverCore, Alan please go ahead.\nAlan S. Gould \u2013 Evercore Partners :  Thank you. I\u2019ve got a question about the Cable Networks. The growth in the Cable Network operating income was much lower this year. Margins were roughly flat with last year. I know there's a lot of incremental sport rights costs, and I know next year you have the new NFL contract. Are we going to \u2013 your sports cost is going up for the next 10 years, as you've said? Should we be seeing margin expansion or should it stay flattish for a while, given all the incremental costs that are coming onboard?\nJames A. Rasulo:   Thanks Alan. Let me \u2013 I guess, when you talk about Cable as a whole it obviously encompasses a lot of things, the ESPN and it's network \u2013 it's part, the domestic Disney channel, international Disney channels and the A&E Network. They all wind up in the same basket. Of course, when you look at an aggregate number, it's very hard to decipher for you guys what's going on within.  Let me say this that ESPN adjusted Cable OI was up 6%. ESPN was significantly higher than that as were the domestic Disney channels, way beyond 6%. I don't want to give specific as to how high they were, but well beyond 6%. What you're seeing that ends up averaging down is the investment in the A&E Network that I mentioned before that shows up in that line as well as a pretty significant investment, the heaviest investment in its lifetime for the launch of the Germany free-to-air channel. And it does take a fair amount of work and money to put up a channel that you expect to be successful in a big country, and that is depressing the average, pulling it down to that 6%.  So, I know it may not be that satisfying, and I am not giving you specific numbers, but they're much stronger up in the high singles and low double-digits for our core networks, and the balance is the opposite as I just mentioned.\nAlan S. Gould \u2013 Evercore Partners :  Okay thank you for that clarification Jay.\nJames A. Rasulo:   Welcome Alan. \nLowell Singer : Thank you. Thanks again everyone for joining us today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Singer, you may begin. \nLowell Singer: Okay, thanks Leslie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Walt Disney Company\u2019s third quarter 2013 earnings call. We issued our press release about 45 minutes ago. It\u2019s available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today\u2019s call is also being webcast. And after the call, we will post a transcript of the call to the website. Joining me for today\u2019s call are Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Jay is going to lead off today. He will be followed by Bob and then we will be happy to take your questions. So, with that, let me turn it over to Jay, and we\u2019ll get going. \nJay Rasulo: Thank you, Lowell, and good afternoon everyone. Earnings per share in the third quarter, excluding items affecting comparability were $1.03. Given the number of headwinds we faced in the quarter, we are very pleased with the financial results we delivered. In the third quarter media networks was once again the largest contributor to our performance. Operating income at cable networks was up a healthy 12% in the quarter, while operating income at broadcasting was down compared to last year. Our strong cable performance was due to continued growth at ESPN and higher equity income from our investment in A&E Television Networks. ESPN\u2019s growth was driven by increased affiliate revenue and to a lesser extent higher advertising revenue. ESPN\u2019s programming and production costs were higher in the quarter, which relates contractual rate increases for Major League Baseball rights and our expansion of the X Games. I mentioned affiliate revenue was the driver of growth at ESPN in the third quarter. If you call, last quarter, we told you we are expecting ESPN to recognize $73 million less in previously deferred revenue in Q3 compared to last year. As it turned out, ESPN actually recognized $64 million more in previously deferred affiliate revenue in Q3 compared to last year. The $137 million swing was the result of ESPN meeting certain programming commitments in the third quarter, which were met in the fourth quarter last year. ESPN was able to meet those programming commitments in Q3 due to the airing of incremental hours of Wimbledon programming. As a result of this shift, ESPN has now recognized all previously deferred affiliate revenue for the year. As such, ESPN will recognize no deferred affiliate revenue in the fourth quarter, which is $172 million less than last year. ESPN cash ad sales were up 9% in the quarter, which is roughly in line with the ad sales pacing we discussed on our Q2 call. ESPN\u2019s reported ad revenue was up 3% as a result as the increase in cash ad sales was partially offset by lower ratings. The decline in ratings during the quarter was primarily related to NBA comparability issues. During the quarter, ESPN aired fewer NBA regular season games compared to last year when the lockout created a more back-end loaded schedule. Also, ESPN air fewer play-off games and those match-ups delivered lower ratings in last year\u2019s playoff games. So far this quarter, ESPN\u2019s cash ad sales are pacing up 11%. At Broadcasting, lower operating income in the quarter was primarily due to three factors. First, higher prime-time programming cost as a result of airing more hours of acquired programming, which was more expensive on a per hour basis. Second, lower program sales compared to last year. If you recall, we sold Grey\u2019s Anatomy and Castle in the third quarter last year and had no comparable sales this year. And third, lower advertising revenue as a 7% decrease in station ad revenue offset a modest increase in ad revenue at the ABC Network. Affiliate revenue at the ABC Network was up nicely in the quarter, but the increase wasn\u2019t sufficient to offset these three items. Quarter-to-date scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running mid-teens above upfront levels. ABC and ESPN recently completed their respective upfronts and we feel great about the pricing increases achieved and the amount of inventory each network was able to sell. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our parks and resorts business. The segment delivered another quarter of solid growth as our recent investments at Walt Disney World and the Disneyland Resort continue to payoff. Revenue was up 7% and operating income was up 9% in the quarter due to growth at our domestic parks and resorts. As we noted during last year quarter\u2019s call, Q3 segment operating income was adversely impacted by an estimated $35 million as a week of the Easter holiday shifted into Q2 this year. Adjusting for this shift, segment operating income growth in Q3 would have been up 15%. Higher operating income at our domestic parks and resorts was primarily due to increased guest spending, occupied room nights, and attendance partially offset by higher costs including ongoing spending for growth initiatives. During the quarter, attendance at our domestic parks was up 3% with Walt Disney World and the Disneyland Resort each setting new Q3 attendance records. Per capita spending was up 7% on higher ticket prices and food and beverage spending. Average per room spending at our domestic hotels was comparable to prior year and even though available room nights increased in the quarter occupancy was comparable to prior year. So far this quarter domestic reservations are pacing up 3% compared to prior year levels while book rates are up 4% versus prior year. Total parks and resort segment margins were up 40 basis points in the third quarter compared to prior year. The year-over-year change in Q3 margins was adversely impacted by an estimated 140 basis points due to the timing of the Easter Holiday and spending on growth initiatives. At the studio we released two films in the third quarter Iron Man 3 and Monsters University both of which performed exceptionally well at the box office. Iron Man 3 generated $1.2 billion in global box office revenue however it faced a difficult comparison with the Avengers which generated $1.5 billion in global box office last year and this is the third highest grossing film of all time. Monsters University box office performance compared favorably to that of Brave last year, however operating income at the studio declined year-over-year. This decline was due to pre-released marketing expenses for the Lone Ranger and the aforementioned Avengers, Iron Man theatrical comparison. The Avengers also had a strong DVD sales in Q4 last year so the DVD release of Iron Man 3 in Q4 this year faces a difficult comparison which we expect to result in a headwind to the studios Q4 results of about $45 million. Needless to say we\u2019re disappointed with the performance of the Lone Ranger and in light of the film\u2019s box office results we expect to incur loss on the film in Q4 of between $160 million and $190 million. Consumer\u2019s products growth and operating income resulted from increases in merchandise licensing and retail. The increase in licensing was primarily due to the inclusion of Star Wars in this quarter\u2019s results. Also earned licensing revenue was up 3% versus last year and that growth is on a comparable basis which excludes any revenue from the newly acquired Star Wars property. The performance of our retail business was driven by higher comp store sales in North America and Japan and higher online sales in North America. We continue to return capital to shareholders by repurchasing our stock during the third quarter; we repurchased 12.6 million shares for about $800 million. Fiscal year-to-date we repurchased 57 million shares for $3.2 billion and with that I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Bob. \nBob Iger: Thank you Jay and good afternoon. We\u2019re pleased with our performance in Q3 and we believe we\u2019re well positioned going forward. I would like to address a couple of specifics about our businesses starting with ESPN which was one again a key driver in Q3, Jay commented about ESPN\u2019s ratings in the quarter and I would like to add some perspective. In an average week more than 113 million Americans tune in or log on to access ESPN content with the average person spending almost 7 hours a week engaged with ESPN Media on a variety of platforms. In Q3 nearly 9 out of 10 homes with access to ESPN tuned in to at least one of the ESPN networks. Since 96% of sporting events are watched live, sports are virtually DVR-proof making ESPN incredibly valuable to advertisers as well as cable operators. We have ranked the ESPN the number one network in perceived value for 13 years in a row and the most important network for nine straight years. Even though ESPN is a clear market leader, it continues to refine its sports portfolio, expand original programming, invest in new technology, and innovate to enhance the fan experience. ESPN\u2019s recent acquisition of the exclusive rights for U.S. Open tennis is growing array of digital services including WatchESPN and the new SEC Network next summer are a few recent examples of ESPN\u2019s constant innovation that will deliver even greater value to consumers, operators, and advertisers. And with so many of the major sports rights locked up for the next 10 years, given ESPN\u2019s brand strength and its continued focus on investment and innovation, we remain confident in ESPN\u2019s value and its position as the number one brand in sports over the long-term. Our acquisition of Marvel also continues to drive real value for us across the company. Following the record setting performance of The Avengers last year, the huge success of Iron Man 3 this summer continue the Marvel momentum, which bodes incredibly well for upcoming Marvel releases including Thor: The Dark World, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, and of course, Avengers 2. We previewed this late at Comic-Con a couple of weeks ago and the phenomenal audience reaction is anything to go by, there is huge appetite for more great Marvel content. There is also a great deal of excitement around ABC\u2019s new series and Avengers spin-off called Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. The first episode got a standing ovation at Comic-Con along with rave reviews. And this month Disney XD premieres its third animated Marvel series. We continue to be extremely pleased with the creative success of our Animation Studios, Monsters University opened in June to become the latest in Pixar\u2019s unbroken string of hits, Planes from Disneytoon Studios opened this Friday, and Frozen, another great movie from Disney Animation will introduce two new Disney princesses when it opens in theatres at Thanksgiving. We are also looking forward to the launch of Disney Infinity on August 18. We have showcased Infinity to a number of audiences and we are very encouraged by the overwhelmingly positive response we are getting across the board from retailers, reviewers, and consumers alike. And we are also very proud of the several best of awards that Disney Infinity earned at this year\u2019s E3. So, given what\u2019s ahead for Disney, ABC, ESPN, Pixar, and Marvel as well as the upcoming Star Wars Episode 7, we are incredibly well-positioned for growth and expect solid results in 2014, \u201815, and beyond. I am going to turn this call back over to Lowell, so that we can take your questions. \nLowell Singer: Thanks Bob. Leslie, we are ready for the first question. \nOperator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. \nDoug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank: Well, thanks so much. Jay, a clarification, I am trying to figure out the math on the fiscal 4Q loss for loan range, what might help is could you give us a sense of the P&A expense that was in June in prior versus what might have been in the fiscal fourth quarter? And then either Jay or Bob, you talked about ESPN at length, Bob, if you got us any competitive impact in the upfront or in the current ad market related to the entry of Fox Sports 1? \nJay Rasulo: Hi, Doug. Let me start, it\u2019s Jay. So, the $160 million to $190 million range that I gave you is the impairment that we will take on the asset of the film and then the operating loss that we will experience in Q4. And you will get a very explicit breakout of those numbers in the Q basically it\u2019s like 86 on impairment than the rest. We don\u2019t know of course what the actual operating loss will be. The reason that we are recognizing that in the fourth quarter just for all of your ratification is that the accounting rules for film cost impairments were amended by the financial accounting standards board and adopted by us of course right thereafter in Q1 of fiscal year \u201913. Under the old rules if a film was released at the end of the quarter but prior to the company\u2019s filing it's statements then the films performance resulted in impairment the company generally was required to record that impairment in the previous quarter in this case would have been Q3 but under the new rules the impairment analysis is limited to information that was available as of quarter end and therefore doesn\u2019t incorporate the actual performance of the film after the balance sheet date so that number is a Q4 number, in the past it would have been the Q3 number. \nBob Iger: The second part of the question Doug ESPN has strong upfront both in terms of the increases on the CPM front (ph) and in terms of overall revenue and did not detect any impact whatsoever from any new competitive forces including Fox Sports 1. \nLowell Singer: Operator next question please. \nOperator: Next question is from Jessica Reif-Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. \nJessica Reif-Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I have two questions one now that you\u2019ve decided to keep Hulu just wondering if you can give us your vision for how it may change or evolve and the second thing is obviously the press for the last two days have been completely focused on retrans. I was just wondering if you can give us your take on how you know how much longer these kind of battles can go on and before you think the government will start to step in. \nBob Iger: On the Hulu front Jessica we as you know with our co-owner Fox explored a sale for considerable amount of time and went free far down the road in terms of that process and during that time we became more and more convinced that there was real strategic value to Hulu and there was value from a financial perspective meaning we could grow it at a rate that would be overall positive for the shareholders of our company. We also decided when we decided to keep it to infuse Hulu with approximately $750 million of new capital that is aimed at strengthening it's team, strengthening it's technology because we believe we need to continue to invest in the technology platform and of course strengthening it's contents or it's programming which is you know we\u2019ve seen new entrants and there are other entrants in the marketplace do extremely well with. I won't get specific in terms of the direction because we\u2019re going to leave that to the management team of Hulu but we think that there is considerable opportunity here and that opportunity will bode well for both Hulu itself but also for content owners who will have a robust platform to sell the content to and for the creative side who will have another entity to sell programming to, or to create for. On the retrans front we never like to see battles like this obviously because we think that sometimes they bring attention to the business that isn't necessarily helpful, that said maybe you would expect this from a programmer but we feel strongly about the need for broadcasters to be paid adequately for the value that they deliver both to consumers or customers of multi-channel services and to the distributors themselves. Even though these broadcast stations can be as you know obtain for free, over the year we know that distributors repackage these signals and in fact sell them as part of other services to consumers and thus we think we should get paid. We also believe that the combination of programming both national and network and local particularly news is really compelling as evidenced by the ratings of these stations deliver compared with the ratings of numerous other channels and therefore we think that the station should get paid accordingly. I don\u2019t really have details about this negotiation so I don\u2019t really want to weigh in specifically about it but I don\u2019t sense that the government is closed to jumping into the fray on this one. I think they probably prefer that we work this out or that owners of stations and distributors work this out themselves but I don\u2019t get a sense that there is government intervention that is imminent because of this. \nLowell Singer: Thanks Jessica. Operator next question please. \nOperator: Next question is from Alexia Quadrani with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. \nAlexia Quadrani - JP Morgan: Alright, thank you. Just staying on the broadcast theme there, could you give us an update on how you view, I guess, the ABC Network going into the fall season? Should we expect also on that topic a lift from the Scandal (indiscernible) in the fiscal fourth quarter? And are you still comfortable with the guide of that I think $400 million to $500 million re-trans revenue by 2015? \nBob Iger: Okay. We do feel comfortable with the guide on the re-trans revenue by 2015 of $400 million to $500 million. We love Scandal and it has been sold to I guess a couple of entities and it also is being sold internationally, but the impact in the fourth quarter is relatively small. As it relates to the ABC Network going into the season we have been saying now for a few quarters that ABC is due to put on its schedule a couple of new strong shows to replace what was the foundation of the schedule over the sort of Desperate Housewives, Lost, Grey\u2019s Anatomy years. We are hopeful that their new schedule will deliver what ABC needs, not only in terms of what I will call the downstream revenue through owning the programs, but also from a ratings perspective and ultimately an advertising perspective. We think they have got a couple of really hot comedies and a couple of hot dramas I mentioned one earlier in S.H.I.E.L.D. I mean, we are going to go into the fall feeling relatively bullish about ABC\u2019s ability to strengthen its schedule and deliver better bottom line, but until the season unfolds you never can quite tell. \nJay Rasulo: Alexia, just as a follow-up since you asked about Broadcast, as Bob said, the Scandal number is pretty small, but there is a little bit of headwind in the fourth quarter, because last year, we sold Castle and Wipeout in the fourth quarter to the tune of about $40 million. So, we will not see that, that revenue repeated in the fourth quarter this year. And not that it relates directly to Broadcast, but to the Media Group in general. We are making some investments. You have all heard about Fusion, our joint venture with Univision, as well as the channel we bought in Germany called Das Vierte and that will create headwinds of about $25 million for Q4. \nAlexia Quadrani - JP Morgan: Okay Thank you very much. \nBob Iger: Thanks Alexia. Operator, next question please. \nOperator: Next question is from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nBen Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Thank you. Bob, could you talk a little bit about the parks top line trends in the domestic market, particularly the per caps, which has remained really strong. I know you guys put in some pricing during the quarter and I would love to hear your thoughts and how you thought about that pricing in this economy, and given the investments you have made and sort of the sustainability of kind of monetizing all of the CapEx over the last several years in that segment? And then Jay, can I ask you on ESPN or on cable in general, I looked in the Q it looks like if you adjust for the deferrals the affiliate revenue growth was sort of in the 6% to 7% range, I just want to see if you had a number around ESPN for the quarter that was clean so we could understand the trends there? \nBob Iger: Overall, the business for our parks domestically is quite good, good enough for us to take another price increase, but this one was somewhat different, and that I think for the first time, we created price differential between the Magic Kingdom and the other parks for the obvious reason that the Magic Kingdom is the most popular park, the most iconic. And so we thought there was an opportunity there. And we didn\u2019t sense any backlash from the marketplace at all. And as you said, we have had strength not just in terms of attendance growth, but we have had strength in terms of spending, not just ticket prices, but room rates and merchandise and food and beverage. I would say that \u2013 we have also had increase in international attendance. Year-to-date, it\u2019s up domestically 7% both Orlando and in California. And so we think that bodes well. And we think that we are well positioned in this quarter, particularly coming off the third quarter, Magic Kingdom in Florida had record numbers as Jay mentioned in the third quarter. By the way that was also true for our park in Tokyo and our park in Hong Kong is also doing quite well. If we are seeing softness in our parks unit, it\u2019s in Europe, at Paris, which Jay also mentioned. So, we think we are well positioned. We have got new product in the marketplace. We are not finished with Fantasyland in Orlando. We still have one big attraction to open, which is going to open in 2014. Cars Land and the impact of that on California Adventure has also continued to show great strength, although in California we are lapping the success of the opening a year ago a bit. I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019ve anything else I would necessarily want to add, we have a lot of other product coming beyond Fantasy Land ultimately we\u2019re going to add Avatar as we have said although we have not announced an opening date yet in Florida, couple of years out at least and we\u2019re going to continue to invest in Disney Land, we have got some pretty exciting things that we will be announcing over the next couple of months. \nBen Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: You didn\u2019t mention MyMagic Plus, any comment on how that\u2019s impacting the business at this point? \nBob Iger: It's really having not an impact from a revenue perspective really at all because we\u2019re still rolling it out and what I would call test phase the reason for that is that this is a very significant undertaking from a technological perspective and we really want to make sure that we walk before we run because we don\u2019t really want to overload our technological backbone. So we\u2019re in what I will call another beta phase that started in August 2nd and it is basically designed for us to have a full roll out, the probable full roll out in the early part of fiscal \u201914 and that\u2019s when you will start to see an impact from a revenue perspective but right now we\u2019re mostly heading cost associated with Magic Plus ahead of what will be we believe some interesting revenue generating opportunities. I can also say that it's working meaning those that are using it and we have got a number of people that have used it have reacted very well. This test that we\u2019re in right now should be probably be used by over 80,000 people or 80,000 guests based on the reservations that we have written against with this initiative attached to them. \nJay Rasulo: On your question of ESPN affiliate revenue I think you mentioned then 6%, you were a little bit low the cable affiliate revenue for Q3 grew in high single digits ESPN of course is the biggest number and it grew a little bit higher than that but still in the high singles. \nBen Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Even if I adjust for the deferrals? \nJay Rasulo: Yes. If you unadjust it it's closer to 10%. \nLowell Singer: Operator next question please. \nOperator: Next question is from Anthony DiClemente with Barclays. Please go ahead. \nAnthony DiClemente \u2013 Barclays: Bob: I would love to get your thoughts on just a general theme of consolidation elsewhere in the media eco-system I guess two big areas where there has been some consolidation or talk of it would be media buying on the agency side and then of course cable distribution and so I was wondering if you thought at that scale in other parts of the ecosystem could impact your business in anyway and then I\u2019ve a follow-up. \nBob Iger: Well on the advertising agency front that announcement was made only recently and so we don\u2019t haven't any sort of really experience in terms of how to judge it, I would say we\u2019re studying it that doesn\u2019t in any way mean that we\u2019re worried about it necessarily but it's still pretty new and we want to understand what it's potential impact could be before we comment about it publically. In terms of consolidation on the distribution front, this is probably the most robust era we have ever seen from a distribution perspective meaning the number of outlets that are available to often sent (ph) to other content owners to distribute their product has grown significantly and pretty dramatically in some cases, obviously Netflix is probably the most recent one and we feel that some consolidation among cable owners if that occurs is going to have no impact whatsoever on our business because there are so many buyers in the marketplace. We also have as you know an array of services that everybody wants fortunately and therefore we think that we have basically the kind of leverage necessary not just to gain access but to achieve the kind of pricing that we need to achieve to grow our businesses. \nAnthony DiClemente \u2013 Barclays: And just one quick follow-up we are heading the football season here I\u2019m just wondering as ESPN has looked at it's matches up for the upcoming NFL Season and college football, I mean is there anything to lookout for in terms of the ratings outlook number one and then just this question maybe a little out there but given digital distribution and authentication wondering if there is anything that we should we mindful of that maybe the ESPN ad sales force has done be it packaging on digital ad sales or innovative forms of mobile distribution of your robust football package at ESPN? Thanks. \nBob Iger: I have long since learned that judging the football schedule before the season unfolds can be, I guess, a bit premature. I either overreact to it meaning thinking that it\u2019s positive or overreact the other way season by season. And I discover year-after-year that until you really see how these teams play what dynamics occur \u2013 as you know it a star quarterback gets injured and suddenly a team that you have two or three times becomes substantially less attractive than before. So, I don\u2019t want to judge this one except to say that at least on paper going in, we feel that we have got a good solid schedule. Last year, we were somewhat disappointed by our results. That\u2019s not just a function of how teams ultimately perform, but sometimes, the quality of the game, I am not suggesting \u2013 what I mean by that is how competitive a game is. So, it\u2019s just too tough to predict. I like the schedule going in this time around, but I have been there many times before only to find out that I might have been wrong and the opposite is true. We have been pleasantly surprised. On the other question that you asked, ESPN has been selling multi-platform advertising for quite a long time. I don\u2019t know the percentage, but it\u2019s extremely high in terms of the number of buyers that ESPN that buy across their various platforms from their digital services to radio, to their magazine, to their channels. And they have grown that nicely. The Watchapp is an opportunity for them to generate more advertising revenue and they are in fact selling ads for the Watchapp, but the numbers even though they are in the probably tens of millions of dollars at this point, they are still relatively small when compared to their total both advertising revenue and their total revenue, but we believe that they will continue to grow. And we obviously believe that I\u2019d say that the penetration of mobile media and not only how fast it has occurred, but how quickly it\u2019s being adopted by the consumers, one of the most dramatic changes we have seen in the media business in a very long time. And I think provides us with a great opportunity considering the fact that we have been at the forefront in many respects of making sure that we are putting products on the mobile platforms or making the product that we have available on non-mobile platforms available via mobile. \nAnthony DiClemente - Barclays: Thanks Bob. Much appreciate it. \nBob Iger: Thank you, Anthony. Operator, next question please. \nOperator: Next question comes from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. \nTodd Juenger - Sanford Bernstein: So, we haven\u2019t talked much about the film or consumer products business yet so let me turn there. On the film side, I think it\u2019s fair to say that the summer box office was not great, at least domestically probably a pretty crowded schedule and some audience fatigue. How should we think about that going forward for you guys, especially given your reliance on Marvel and Lucasfilm and the risk that you are a little bit highly leveraged against sort of the Sci-Fi superhero genre, I know your risk of longer term fatigue of that? Then the related question is how should we think about the opportunity in the consumer products side, especially from Lucasfilm and I guess still a little bit from Marvel as you really try and capitalize on those properties? How long does that take to get through the system and into the retail shelf? And should we think about that is incremental or is some of that displacing other shelf space and just changing the mix a little bit? Thanks. \nBob Iger: Okay. Let\u2019s first characterize summer box office, these last number of summers have been very competitive and quite crowded. I don\u2019t know that this summer got any more crowded or more competitive than before although certainly there was a lot of attention paid to it. We actually think we had an excellent summer and that we ended up with Iron Man 3, which did over $1.2 billion in global box office, which is substantially above what Iron Man 2 and Iron Man 1 did and the highest Marvel box office film of all time next to Avengers. We actually think Avengers helped Iron Man 3 and we believe that the impact of Avengers will be felt on future Marvel products, particularly Thor, which is coming up first and then Captain America, and of course, Avengers 2. There has been a lot said I know about the risk of basically high-cost tent-pole films, and we certainly can attest to that given what happened with Lone Ranger, and Jay went into the details. We still believe that a tent-pole strategy is a good strategy that one way to rise above the din and the competition is with a big film, not just a big budget but big story, big cast, big marketing behind it. We think that the Disney, Pixar, Marvel and ultimately the Star Wars Lucas Brand will actually contribute to our ability to rise above that then and compete quite effectively but we also know and I know I\u2019m probably saying the obvious but you still have to make really strong films. So I don\u2019t know that the dynamic has changed that much expect that if there are tempo films being made I guess technically there is more risk in the marketplace. But we have known all about that risk for quite some time. As we look forward as I mentioned we feel very confident in them obviously. I mentioned three of them Guardians of the Galaxy as another one which we\u2019re very excited about and that the Marvel character library is only being mined from the tip of the iceberg perspective we will be mindful of not going to the well too often because it's hard to make great films and so our charge to Marvel is bring films to market where you really believe in the stories and the story tellers. Disney Live Action, we\u2019re going to continue to make probably in the neighborhood of five to at the very, very most 10 but most cases it's less than that, Live Disney, Live Action Films. Some will be tempo films like we have Maleficent coming up as for instance Tomorrowland is another one, some will be much lower budget films like Saving Mr. Banks which is coming up at the end of this calendar year and of course we believe in Lucas and Star Wars which is \u201915 and then our animation strategy is clearly working. We did almost 260 million in box for Monsters 2 and we\u2019re hopeful that it's going to exceed $400 million in box office outside the United States which will make it I think the fourth highest grossing Pixar film of all time with Toy Story and Nemo and one other ahead of it that\u2019s a pretty good story. We like what\u2019s happening with Disney Animation. We have had a couple of real hits in Tangled and in Wreck It Ralph and we believe in Frozen coming up and we\u2019ve got a really fine movie coming up this weekend in Plains (ph) which is made by Disney 2 studios but it bears the Disney brand was that one point going to be a direct a video and we looked at it and we saw the quality we decided that bring it up theatrically was a wise move. So I know that\u2019s a long way of my saying that we think that Marvels, Disney, Pixar, Lucas Branded film strategy is a good one for us not only because of what we believe it can deliver from a box office perspective but the obvious value it delivers to this company across so many platforms from games, Infinite is a good example to our consumer products and you\u2019ve to consider publishing as part of that because the digital side of publishing and of course what it means for us and our products we\u2019re evidence of all of these branded franchise films is clear both domestically and internationally across all of our products businesses. On the consumer products front we believe that there is upside or incremental earnings from the mining of the consumer products that will come from not only the marble franchises but also from Lucas even though there have been a lot of Star Wars, a lot of Star Wars product out in the marketplace. We think that when we put these companies together combining the teams and taking all these great product to market that there is a substantial potential not only to increase sales but to increase royalties for these products and so we view the consumer product side of these acquisitions as truly additive. \nLowell Singer: Operator next question please. \nOperator: Next question is from David Bank with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nDavid Bank - RBC Capital Markets: So I guess a question with respect to CapEx and capital allocation I think while there are always ample opportunities to invest in the business it seems like the perception is that CapEx is sort of peaked and probably headed downward trajectory wise, yet your leverage is still amongst the lowest in the industry and what are your thoughts in terms of increasing capital returns overtime? Is there something in particular you\u2019re keeping that powder (ph) dry for, what are your thoughts around that? \nBob Iger: Thanks, David. I am probably not going to reveal anything to you that you haven\u2019t heard me say before, but let me reiterate how we think about this. I think that you, first of all, you are correct in that. Our belief is that a lot of the capital investment we have been engaged in, particularly in parks and resorts over the past three or four years plus the deployment of capital in acquisitions will yield returns such that we will have the great problem of dealing with increasing cash flow as the years go by. We look very hard for internal and organic ways to invest our capital above our rate of return. We think that\u2019s why our investors give us their money to invest. And I think we have demonstrated a pretty good track record at finding projects in our businesses that allow us on an incremental basis to create returns that are very, very attractive to shareholders. That being said, we are not departing from kind of the formula we have used in returning capital to shareholders, where we have consistently returned 20% or so of the cash generated by the company to shareholders in terms of buybacks. If you look at this year\u2019s buyback plan, you see that it\u2019s so far this year pretty consistent with that at $3.2 billion. Remember, we committed buy in the Lucas shares over two years. And if you look at last year\u2019s CapEx \u2013 I am sorry buyback versus this year\u2019s you will see that it is nicely up. And to sort of comment on keeping your powder dry, we are not cash hoarders. We have an excellent balance sheet that we worked very hard at keeping as a strategic asset for the company to allow us access to the capital markets. You see our interest expense is way down this year. That\u2019s due to the fact that we have been able to both refinance high-cost debt like we had at Disneyland Paris as well as borrow money at record levels in terms of the issues we have made. So, we feel very good about our balance sheet, access to cash, we don\u2019t feel the need to afford cash. So, if we do not find ample internal opportunities in terms of investment or interesting acquisitions, then we will in fact increase our returns to shareholders. \nDavid Bank - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you. \nBob Iger: You are welcome. Operator next question please. \nOperator: Next question is from Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nMarci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo: Thanks. I have two questions. I think the first, there seems to be a little bit of variability in affiliate fee growth from quarter-to-quarter. And Jay, I think you made it a point to call this out during an Investor Conference some point in late May. So, is there any way to think about affiliate fee growth in fiscal Q4 or even beyond and just other than new contracts coming on what are the various puts and takes for affiliate fee growth? So, that\u2019s the first question. And then second just in the broadcast sector, is there any color on how you are pacing right now at the broadcast networks and stations? \nJay Rasulo: Okay. On the first half, I appreciate your, I will call it frustration. I didn't hear frustration in your voice, but the difficulty in quarter-to-quarter forecasting of affiliate fees and it has to do with the way we build for instance, let me give you an example. In Q2, our affiliate revenue benefited from an extra day in the billing cycle in 2012 so-called leap year and that effects the growth in that quarter more than you might imagine. Relative to giving you some insight into Q4, we are looking at high single-digit growth in terms of affiliate revenue. And I am sorry I can\u2019t help you with all the adjustments that come in and out every quarter in terms of how that affiliate number grows. The range is pretty tight, I will tell you that, but within a couple of percentage points, it\u2019s very hard for you guys to predict that accurately. In terms of pacing\u2019s, I'll say this the stations are pacing down in Q4 in part due to comp issues that we have last year, we have the benefit of the Emmy's which is 3 to 4 percentage points of growth in ad revenues this year. The Emmy\u2019s will be on CBS. We won\u2019t have that. So, that will obviously affect and there is some more challenging political comp this year versus last year and that again is a couple of percentage points which is effecting the ad pay in that stations. \nLowell Singer: Thank you Marcy. Operator next question please. \nOperator: Next question is from David Miller with B. Riley & Company. Please go ahead. \nDavid Miller - B. Riley & Company: Couple of questions, Jay on the prognostication of losses for Lone Ranger the 160 to 190 I\u2019m just curious why give a range now, why do you not, I mean why give a range at all is it just because the film is just sort of swimming around various theatrical markets overseas and you\u2019re just kind of waiting to see what the final number is or are you just kind of weigh into additional analysis, why give a range why not just kind of pinpoint a little bit more exactly what the loss is going to be and then Bob correct me if I\u2019m wrong but I believe your NBA contract comes up for renewal with ESPN in 2016 with the emergence of Fox Sports 1 and just given Rupert sort of ready, fire, aim kind of mentality with regard to sports rights in general. If Fox Sports 1 wants to overbid or bid against you for the NBA and you come to the termination that you cannot make the NBA work in terms of your ROIC targets. Are you prepared to walk away from the NBA in the same way that you guys walked away from the NHL? Thanks very much. \nJay Rasulo: I will be brief on the reason for the range. We\u2019re only opening 40% of international markets with Lone Ranger and it goes all the way out to I think Japan opened in September if I\u2019m not mistaken. So, I think that\u2019s the last market, so that\u2019s the reason for the ranger. \nDavid Miller - B. Riley & Company: Got it. \nBob Iger: The NBA David is very important to ESPN both from a quality of programming perspective but also from a volume perspective and it's certainly a priority of ESPN to extend their relationship with the league. I think the league would believe that it would beneficial for them as well to stay on ESPN which is a very, very important platform for them. I don\u2019t want to sound in anyway as though we\u2019re complacent but I think it would be safe to assume that we\u2019re reasonably confident that we will be able to extend that relationship and I do not want to at any way give any prediction or whatever is what we might do if the price gets to a point that it's substantially above what we expected. \nLowell Singer: Thanks David. Operator we\u2019ve time for one more question. \nOperator: Okay. The last question comes from Barton Crockett with Lazard Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nBarton Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets: Now on the topic on the expansion of distribution and then opportunity right now for Disney that you brought up early on the call. There has been a lot of press reporting about you know new over the top services that could emerge you know companies like Intel, others that have reported. I was wondering without kind of commenting specifically about a company if you could talk generally about this type of service in terms of your belief in the probability that we can see something materially over the next few quarters and the possibility of getting some type of material minimum guarantee that could be noticeable in your P&L. \nJay Rasulo: I don\u2019t know that you will see much impact in the next few quarters although I think it may be some new distributors out there that are looking to make content deals in the near term, you mentioned Intel being potentially one of them. I still believe that overall these new platforms whether they are over the top or not offer us more and new opportunities to monetize their content and our approach to them will probably be somewhat consistent with how we have approached other distributors both incumbents and new distributors. We look with an open mind towards a distributors that we believe the ability to create a viable platform in terms of their ability to us for our content but also a viable platform for the consumer one with a good interface and one that\u2019s likely to ultimately stick in terms of distribution. So I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re going to see substantial change in the environment meaning distribution environment in the near term because of these but I think it's safe to say that over certainly the next five years there is going to be more than one new entrants in the marketplace. \nBob Iger: Thank you Barton and thanks again everyone for joining us today.

My name is Mellissa and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Lowell, you may begin.\nLowell Singer: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Walt Disney Company's second quarter 2013 earnings call. We issued our press release about 45 minutes ago. It\u2019s available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast and we will post a transcript to our website after the call. Joining me in New York for today\u2019s call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob will make some comments followed by Jay and then we will be happy to take some questions. So with that let me turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert Iger: Thank you very much, Lowell and good afternoon everyone. We had a strong second quarter with earnings per share up 36% over last year when adjusted for comparability, driven primarily by studio, parks and resorts, and media networks. We are pleased with our overall performance, confident in our strategy and thrilled with the stock price that keeps reaching new record highs. Of course it's great to announce such a strong earnings just after we are rolling another Marvel blockbuster, Iron Man 3, which had incredible domestic opening with almost $175 million. That makes it the second biggest opening weekend of all times surpassed only by The Avengers. Internationally, Iron Man 3 set new opening weekend box office records in a number of countries and has already brought in over $525 million outside the U.S. So to date the global box office for Iron Man 3 is more than $711 million. We are proud of this movie and thrilled with its performance. The Avengers franchise is certainly strong today but we have a lot more to come with, Thor: The Dark World in November, Captain America: The Winter Soldier next year, and The Avengers 2 in 2015. On the animation front, Pixar continues to create great value for our company too. We are very excited about Monsters University which opens next month. Pixar's slate of films for the next five years includes fantastic original stories as well as some great sequels to their previous hits. And as we recently announced, we are in production on one of those sequels, Finding Dory, featuring Ellen DeGeneres once again as the voice of Dory, one of the most beloved characters from Finding Nemo which was one of the most popular and profitable movies to date. On to Lucasfilm, our integration is well underway and based on our success with Pixar and Marvel, we\u2019re confident we can drive great value from this acquisition. In addition to the Star Wars feature films that we\u2019ve already talked about, we\u2019re also working on opportunities for television and our parks. It\u2019s still very early in the process. We\u2019ll announce details as these developments evolve. In the meantime, with great ten-fold features like Iron Man 2 and Monsters University, followed by Johnny Depp as Tonto in the Lone Ranger in July, our studio has delivered an incredibly strong slate of movies and we have a lot more to look forward to. As I mentioned earlier, Parks and Resorts contributed significantly to our results this quarter as the investments we\u2019ve made in our domestic and international parks over the last several years begin to drive growth. We\u2019ve completed the phenomenal transformation of Disney California Adventure, added two spectacular new cruise ships and we\u2019re well into our historic expansion of Fantasy Land as well as Disney World. And later this month we\u2019ll complete our recent expansion of Hong Kong Disneyland with the opening of another new Land. In Q2 Walt Disney World and the Disneyland Resort both set new attendance records for the quarter. Attendance in our Disneyland resort is now more evenly split between Disneyland and California Adventure, a strategic goal of our investment in that expansion. And in Hong Kong Disneyland, the addition of new lands and attractions also continue to drive strong performance. Cable Networks were another important contributor to our results this quarter. As I mentioned on our last call, with 30,000 hours of sports programming across all platforms every year, long term rights to the marquee events, ESPN is still the most must-have brand for sports fans. And we just announced a 20 year agreement between ESPN and the Southeastern Conference to create and operate a national multi-platform network airing SEC content 24/7. ESPN has been covering the SEC since 1982 and this new network will provide an unparalleled SEC fan experience with live sports coverage as well as studio shows and original programming. The new network launches in August 2014 and will serve SEC fans as well as multi-channel distributors and advertisers who want to reach them. Our Kids Television portfolio is also doing extremely well and Disney Channel continues to be our biggest and most effective global brand builder and content engine, bringing Disney directly into hundreds of millions of homes around the world. We leveraged that strength to successfully launch Disney XD in multiple new markets and more recently the launched Disney Junior which now reaches almost 400 million homes in 166 countries. Here in the U.S, Disney Junior is now a 24 hour channel, reaching nearly 60 million homes, anchored by hit preschool series like Sofia the First, Jake and the Never Land Pirates, Doc McStuffins and Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. Disney Junior is beating Nick Junior\u2019s ratings by double digits in almost every category and beating Sprout\u2019s ratings by triple digits across the board. As an emerging franchise driver for our company, the success of Disney Junior goes far beyond television. Disney Junior branded products have a strong and rapidly growing presence in the preschool retail space, with retail sales expected to increase by 80% to $1.5 billion in the current fiscal year. Finally, turning to Disney Interactive, yesterday we announced the new gaming agreement with Electronic Arts to deliver and publish several new games based on the epic Star Wars franchise. As you know, EA is one of the world\u2019s premier developers of mobile, tablet, console and PC games and this multi-year, multi-title and multi-platform agreement will allow us to bring great new Stars Wars game experiences to the core gaming audience. We\u2019re already planning the first titles from this agreement and we look forward to announcing them with EA soon. And as part of this deal, Disney retains rights to develop new titles within mobile, social, tablet and online gaming categories as well as the right to develop new titles for the Asian gaming market. So overall we feel great about what we achieved in Q2. We have an effective strategy and we\u2019re looking forward to what\u2019s ahead. It\u2019s an exciting time at Disney, driven by high quality creative content and our unparalleled ability to leverage it for continued long term growth. I\u2019m now going to ask Jay to review the details of our performance and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Jay?\nJames Rasulo: Thank you Bob and good afternoon everyone. We delivered another quarter of excellent financial performance, with segment operating income up 29% on revenue growth of 10%. Earnings per share excluding items effecting comparability were up an impressive 36%. These results demonstrate the ongoing successful execution of our strategy and our ability to monetize our assets, and the performance of recent investments in our parks and resorts and business. Let me spend a few minutes discussing our second quarter in more detail and then I will highlight some factors that may influence our performance for the third quarter. Growth at media networks was due to increased operating income from our cable networks, partially offset by a decline in our broadcasting business. The performance of our cable business in the second quarter reflects the benefit of new affiliate agreements resulting in total cable affiliate revenue growth in the low teens or almost 10% when adjusting for the impact of revenue deferral timing at ESPN and foreign exchange rates. Operating income at cable increased 15% on revenue growth of 9%, primarily due to growth at ESPN. Results at ESPN were driven by increased affiliate and advertising revenue partially offset by increased programming and production costs. The increase in programming costs were related to contractual rate increases for college football and college basketball rights. During the second quarter ESPN deferred $70 million in affiliate revenue compared to last year, which benefited reported revenue. In the third quarter, ESPN will recognize $73 million less in net deferred revenue than in the prior year, which will have an unfavorable impact on Q3 reported revenue. I will remind you these changes have no impact on full year results. ESPN ad revenue was up 4% in the second quarter primarily due to higher units sold and higher rates. So far this quarter, ESPN's ad revenue, ad sales are pacing up more than 10%. At broadcasting, lower operating income in the quarter was due to higher cost write-offs for underperforming shows and increase in prime time programming costs for acquired programming and a decline in ad revenue at the ABC network, partially offset by an increase in ad revenue at our own stations. The decline in ad revenue at the network was due to lower ratings partially offset by higher rates and an increase in online advertising. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was down low-single digits compared to the prior year. Quarter to date scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running more than 25% above upfront levels. Ad revenue at the stations was up 5% during the second quarter and so far in Q3, TV station ad sales are pacing down single digits versus prior year. Or parks and resorts segment delivered an impressive quarter with the revenue up 14% and operating income up 73%. The increase in operating income was primarily due to growth in domestic operations as a result of higher guest spending and attendance at Walt Disney World and the Disneyland Resort, and higher passenger cruise days given a full quarter of operation for the Disney Fantasy. These increases were partially offset by higher cost which were primarily due to growth initiatives. For the quarter, attendance at our domestic parks was up 8% and per capita spending was up 10% on higher ticket prices, food and beverage and merchandize spending. Average per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 7% and occupancy was down 2 percentage points to 80% due to an increase in available room nights at Walt Disney World. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 7% compared to prior year levels, while book rates are comparable to prior year levels. Higher operating income at our international operations reflects higher guest spending at Disneyland Paris and increased attendance at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, partially offset by low results from Tokyo Disney Resort, reflecting the absence of business interruption insurance proceeds that we collected last year. Total segment margins were up almost 400 basis points in the second quarter compared to the prior year, and were favorably impacted by about two percentage points due to the timing of New Year's and Easter holidays. While operating income in the second quarter was aided by a portion of the New Year and Easter holidays falling in Q2, relative to when those holiday periods fell last year, the results also reflected improved attendance and spending throughout the period and the growth investments we have made over the past couple of years are performing well. Studio entertainment operating income improved significantly in the quarter due to lower film write-offs compared to prior year and improvement in our worldwide theatrical results due to the strong performance of Oz The Great And Powerful and Wreck-it Ralph compared to John Carter last year. At Consumer Products, the increase in operating income resulted from higher performance in Merchandise Licensing and retail. The increase in Licensing is due to higher revenue from Disney Channel standard character and Marvel merchandize, partially offset by lower revenue from Cars merchandise as well as the resolution of a licensee audit. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up low single digits versus last year. the performance of our retail business was driven by higher comp store sales in North America and Japan as well as higher online sales in North America. Results at our Interactive business improved this quarter due to higher operating income from our Japan mobile business, increased sales of mobile games and lower purchase accounting impact at our social games business. As we look to the third quarter, I\u2019d like to highlight a few factors that will impact our results, most of which are timing related. At Parks and Resorts, the timing of the Easter holiday will adversely impact our Q3 results as only one week of the two week holiday fell in Q3, whereas the entire holiday period fell in Q3 last year. we estimate the adverse impact of the Easter holiday shift on Q3 to be about $35 million. Our studio results in the third quarter will be impacted by the timing of pre-released marketing expenses for the Lone Ranger, which will be released domestically and in some international markets very early in fiscal Q4. At Interactive, we expect an operating loss in Q3 that is comparable to the loss in the second quarter, due primarily to the shifting of the release date of our Infinity game from Q3 to Q4. And at Broadcasting, programming expenses are expected to be about $40 million higher due to increase in hours of original programming compared to last year. we also face a difficult syndication comparison due to the sale of shows, including Castle in the prior year as well as lower sales of library shows this year which we expect to have a total adverse impact of about $40 million in Q3. We continued to repurchase our stock during the second quarter by buying back 15.8 million shares for about $850 million. Fiscal year to date we have repurchased 38 million for $2 billion. We feel great about the results this quarter and for the first half of the fiscal year. we remain incredibly well positioned strategically and financially which enables us to continue to create value for our shareholders. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lowell for questions.\nLowell Singer: Thank you, Jay. Operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Michael Nathanson with Nomura. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nathanson - Nomura Securities: A quick housekeeping for Jay and then one for Bob. Jay, thanks for giving us the organic (inaudible) number. You\u2019ve made Lowell\u2019s life more easier tonight. The question I have for you is for the rest of the year, what\u2019s the right rate to think about a like-for-like growth on affiliated users? Is there anything unusual about this quarter or low teens be consistent for the rest of next couple of quarters?\nJames Rasulo: I think in general you can look for high single digits, low teens moving forward for the rest of the year. nothing extraordinary about this quarter.\nMichael Nathanson - Nomura Securities: And Bob for you, Jay just laid out the big picture story on earlier drivers kicking in the next couple of years. You said the past few years investing in franchises, investing in your parks, while your competitors are focused on buying back stock, you look at the next couple of years your drivers are all known to you. So do you consider at this point increasing the capital returns levels, dividends, buybacks or you've been adding some incremental debt to the company? How do you think about that knowing all you\u2019ve done is now paying dividends?\nRobert Iger: Well, we feel good about our ability to deliver more free cash flow and don\u2019t have much to say specifically about how we\u2019ll allocate it, except that as you look back we obviously made three pretty important and large acquisitions in Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm, which we think delivered great -- has already delivered and will continue to deliver great growth and value to our shareholders. But I am not sure that we -- as we see ahead, we see opportunities that are of [life-size] not to preclude that from occurring completely but it's just not obviously to us. That will than leave us with the opportunity if we continue to grow our cash flow, to increase our dividend or buyback more shares. While we have not made that decision yet, I think it will be a good problem for us to have.\nJames Rasulo: I think, Michael, in terms of the capital allocation, I mean almost because it's a given, Bob didn\u2019t mention it. First and foremost, we look for internal opportunities to invest our capital in projects like you have seen us do over the last five years, in addition to acquisitions. You know the work we have done in parks and resorts, the joint venture on free-to-air television stations. I mean we constantly look for ways that we can get superior returns through investment in organic growth and we continue to want to grow the company organically. What's left after that Bob just handled.\nRobert Iger: We have also never really been a hoarder of cash, so I think you can expect that philosophy will continue. And we have been pleased with our credit rating. And I doubt you will see us going to the market in the way that would necessarily -- that would impact our rating, for more debt that is.\nOperator: Next question is Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Just to clarify, Jay, I wanted to ask you, the almost 10% growth in affiliate rev, that was organic ex-currency and ex-deferrals, was that ESPN or overall cable? I realize we are kind of splitting hairs here but...?\nJames Rasulo: That was the overall cable number. I can tell you that if you back those factors out Ben, you are looking at 12.5% growth this year in affiliate revenues. If you back out this quarter -- I am sorry, if you back out the deferral and the FX impacts.\nBenjamin Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley: At cable?\nJames Rasulo: Yes.\nBenjamin Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thank you. And then is there any particular reason -- would parks margins be better because of the calendar shift. I realize it benefits attendance etcetera, but that would be obviously the incremental expenses from the extra....?\nJames Rasulo: Yes. But of course with the flow through you have on incremental business, in our business when you are taking on that kind of incremental revenue in a single quarter and if you think about, for instance around the holiday period, we are already fully staffed. So we are pretty, very strong flow through. So, yes, we think that of the 400 basis points, about two percentage points was due to the shift in the front end and the back end of that quarter in terms of impact on margins.\nBenjamin Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thanks. And then lastly, Bob, could you just talk about your outlook for the studio segment? You have put a lot of capital to work with Lucas and Marvel. And clearly the titles are kicking on all cylinders. When you look back a few year ago, this was a billion dollar plus profit pool. And I know the DVD markets changed and you have also made some headcount changes. How do you think about the potential here for that line over the next several years as you roll out all these franchise (inaudible)?\nRobert Iger: Well, I think you will see more and more focus on big [tempo] films and less on non-franchise, non-branded smaller films. You have to -- when you consider about strategy and that investment, you also have to consider the impact that that investment in those films have across the company. So obviously, consumer products, to some extent interactive, certainly there are opportunities on the theme park front. So we feel good about the slate ahead from all sectors of the company. Disney Animation which is giving an excellent Christmas film in Frozen. Pixar, I mentioned on the call, would a blend of sequels like Monsters, and for instance in Nemo, with some real good original shows, original movies rather. I mentioned Marvel, which is very very rich. Star Wars in 2015 and then some Disney live action films that we feel quite good about in terms of our ability to basically drive decent return from them. So it is definitely a more challenged business in terms of, what I will call, physical sales, or the physical home entertainment side of the business. That is sell-through and rental of physical goods. But it's been growing nicely on the digital front and I think that bodes well for the future.\nOperator: Next question is Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nDouglas Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank: One for Bob and one for Jay. Bob, if you could talk about the timing of the rollout of MyMagic Plus and is there any way to give us a sense of the potential impact from that initiative? It\u2019s not the easiest thing for us to model. And for Jay, hotel bookings up 7% against flat room rates. Is there a discounting strategy to drive hotel market share or are those both an organic outcome as you look at it right now?\nJames Rasulo: I\u2019ll start, Doug. On hotel bookings, I would say it\u2019s an organic outcome. We have -- in California, because of the strength of the demand that has accompanied Disney\u2019s California Adventure, we have really rolled out a lot of the discounting that\u2019s taking place on that property and feel very good about demand holding up despite that and the overall both strategic and financial impact that product is having. But of course when you\u2019re looking at average book rates across the domestic business it\u2019s heavily weighted towards Walt Disney World. We\u2019ve brought on a lot more inventory with that new value hotel that we\u2019ve opened. And I think that we feel pretty strongly that you\u2019re seeing the demand numbers and remember when you bring on a big value hotel, the very mix of the pricing that you have across the inventory of rooms will continue to push your rate down a little bit. But there\u2019s no enormous -- there\u2019s no promotional pricing that\u2019s taking place to push volume right now in that business. We\u2019re really at a point as we said we would be where we are yielding the volume returns and pricing returns on the ticket side that accompany the investment we\u2019ve made in that product and I think you\u2019ll continue to see that as Fantasy Land fully opens and then as MyMagic Plus is fully implemented which Bob can speak to right now in terms of timing.\nRobert Iger: The goal is for us to roll out MyMagic Plus at some point this year. it\u2019s at various levels of beta testing right now. We want to be very careful that it is working absolutely right before we roll it out to the general public. There\u2019s no reason for us to rush it to market. In terms of what we can expect return wise, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s somewhat -- although we\u2019ve modeled it, it\u2019s somewhat difficult to be specific about. You can expect that it will create a better experience and with that we believe people will spend more time in our parks and ultimately deliver more business per guest. We also know that it will deliver some up sell opportunities in terms of the array of products that basically digital technology will allow. And we also think it\u2019s going to give us somewhat of a competitive advantage. I think you have to look at all of those things, basically new products to sell, better experience that should obviously keep people coming back for more or staying longer and then the competitive advantage would be the way to do it. But I can\u2019t get specific with you, Doug in terms of how to model that.\nDouglas Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Perhaps then Bob just in terms of timeframe, would that be something where by fiscal \u201914 you\u2019d think we\u2019d start to see some impact?\nRobert Iger: Yes. I think -- well, I definitely believe we\u2019ll see some impact in fiscal \u201914. That\u2019s certainly our plan. So you were going to mention \u2026\nJames Rasulo: Yeah. Doug, just in terms of how to think about this, we have known for a really long time that getting our visitors to Walt Disney world, to make decisions about where they spend their time before they leave home, is a powerful driver of visits per guest. When they get into the Orlando market and their time isn\u2019t yet planned, they can be subject to everything you see down there which is a lot of in-city marketing for all the many products that people have put there to basically bleed off the feed that we fundamentally motivate. So if we can get people to plan their vacation before they leave home, we know that we get more time with them. We get a bigger share of their wallet. So that\u2019s one thing for you guys to think about. And the second thing is what happens to purchases when they become much more convenient and you don\u2019t spend time queuing up for a transaction, queuing up to get in the park and you actually have more time to enjoy the entertainment and subsequently spend more money doing things that other than standing in line which of course you can't spend any money while you are doing that. So those are the components. Bob spoke to the enhanced product and competitive advantages and so on, sort of on the more strategic level, but on components to think about how to model that financially, you might think through some of those.\nOperator: Next question is Jessica Reif-Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif-Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I have one for Bob and one for Jay. Bob, I will start with you. The company is obviously hitting on, basically into all cylinders, the parks, films that you mentioned and consumer products, cable networks etcetera. With a really strong multiyear outlook, there is one exception, which is the television business. Meaning not the just the [book itself] but also your TV production is not at the levels of some of your peers. How much of a focus is it for you and can you give us some specifics about what you are thinking about doing in terms of turning that around?\nRobert Iger: Well, I think the network and particularly in this quarter, the stations too, had somewhat of a tough run these last few months. Station business has been generally soft by the way. And even though our stations are performing well in their markets, and actually in some markets growing share nicely, the markets themselves are basically compressing or getting smaller. And that\u2019s obviously an issue. On the network front, we like a stronger prime time schedule, particularly one that is populated with more programming that we own. It's hard to look at that year-over-year in terms of the products that we own because we tend to look more long-term with these investments than short-term. So from a short-term perspective, you have to say that Scandal is certainly, a program that we own, has great potential in terms of delivering on our investment but we like more of them. So what you really end up doing there is you hope that your team is place, which is a great team, comes up with the kind of shows that not only drive higher ratings and more advertising revenue but ultimately includes a number of shows that we own, that drive more revenue in general. And it's basically -- there was no real secret to it, Jessica, as you know, you have been following this for a long time. But we could use a few more new hits and certainly hits that we own. It's that simple. Paul Lee is hard at work with his team on that as you know, as we speak. I have seen the pilots. I am reasonably encouraged by what I have seen, actually more than reasonably encouraged. I am very encouraged by what I have seen and hopeful that the year ahead will deliver more value for us than the year prior.\nJessica Reif-Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks. And then on the parks for Jay. I have a couple of really short questions. Can you breakout what percent of the cost of variable at this point, what your mix is of international and domestic visitors? Obviously, spending has come down quite a bit. But if you could give us, kind of update your thoughts on kind of what margins you have set and that you expect to get to the peak margins at least in the U.S. which we [can see] up. You know how do you feel about margins kind of over the next few years?\nJames Rasulo: Okay. Let me try to take a couple of those. So in terms of the international domestic mix, this quarter is same exact mix as last quarter. I told you that in general we run between 18% and 22%. We are at the low end in Q2 of that. But our strength has been from Brazil and the UK, a little bit of weakness from Canada in the second quarter. But I would say there is not a big story there, although we would love to see our business from Brazil continue to grow, it's been a real driver for us and it's nice to see growth back from the UK. In past quarters a lot of our international attendance growth has been from Canada. So anyway, I think the story there is within the range and we are pretty happy with it. With the overall increase in volume international has kept its pace. In terms of margins, the story there is going to be one of improving margins as we put behind us the launch cost and ramp up lower margins of new business initiatives that has been affecting us since we started on our big parks capital program. Sort of every quarter or every other quarter we have been launching the business. There has been substantial pre-opening costs that are associated with those of course with no revenue and even in the following quarter when the revenue starts it\u2019s usually not at full tilt. So that should be contributing to our overall margins. We\u2019re pretty happy frankly with what we see in the base business margins. If you back out the things that we backed out, I think this has been a quarter that has evidenced very, very strong fundamental growth in margins in that business. And even though there has been a lot of structural changes that have occurred since we used to talk about 20% margin i.e. the consolidation of businesses overseas into the park segment that were not consolidated before, recognizing incentive comp in the park\u2019s margin which was not done before. When you take those things out, we really do believe that we can get back on a steady state basis to the kinds of margins we had pre-downturn. So I think the story is good there. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t give you a whole bunch more detail. In terms of the variable percentage, it varies through the course of the year. obviously you are in periods where more down periods in the year when more of the costs are fixed. When you go through the holidays like New Year\u2019s and Easter you have a much larger variable component. But I can\u2019t really give you too much more insight beyond that.\nOperator: Next question is Alexia Quadrani with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani - JP Morgan: Just staying on the parks for a minute, given your experience at Cars Land and the real imprecise attendance growth that has followed that opening, could you give us a bit of color how we should think about Fantasy Land renovation, how significant can it be in terms of driving growth going forward at Disneyworld and any sense of how much that might have already -- I know part of it was renovated and opened, but a lot of it is still ahead of us. Any sense on the timing when we might see a big marketing push behind or we might see more of a notable impact on that renovation.\nRobert Iger: Well, as you may or may not know, the Magic Kingdom Park in Orlando is the number one park down there. It\u2019s actually the number one park in the world. And we hadn\u2019t really done much to Fantasy Land in many, many years since we opened. So this was significant both from our perspective, but also from a guest perspective. The only thing I can tell you that may give you some sense is that the Magic Kingdom broke an all-time single day record for attendance during the Easter holiday and we believe that was a direct result of the investment that we made in Fantasy Land. Obliviously the summer will tell us a lot more. We do know from a guest satisfaction perspective that the numbers that we\u2019re seeing from the Magic Kingdom, specifically from Fantasy Land, are way up. We have more to open as you cited Alexia, but what we\u2019ve opened is really being well received.\nAlexia Quadrani - JP Morgan: And in terms of the expenses or launch costs, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s straight line as far your opening or was there a bigger component of it that comes later on that we\u2019ll see a bit more cost pressure around?\nJames Rasulo: I wouldn\u2019t expect to see significant cost pressure. When you think about the magnitude of Fantasy Land, extraordinarily important for us to do that Magic Kingdom because of all of the reasons Bob just discussed. But if you look at the impact of that on the overall cost base at Walt Disneyworld, it\u2019s nothing like the Disney\u2019s California Adventure expansion which was substantive relative to the base of the Disneyland resort. So I wouldn\u2019t look very hard for a whole bunch of costs associated with this launch and I think that you can see certainly in \u201914 you will start to see a reasonably good contribution from that. I wouldn\u2019t look for a cost degradation there.\nOperator: Next question is Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nTodd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein: I have what is probably a handful of questions that are disguised as one question. So I\u2019ll just limit myself to that. I\u2019m interested in your international television business. So particularly as a network operator or other cases where you\u2019re the de facto operator by licensing large box of content and really just interested in any commentary you\u2019d share on how fast is that part of your business growing in both affiliate fees and advertising? How much is that contributing to your immediate segment growth of those line items? What are the margin trends? I told you this was several questions disguised as one. And the top, how big that would be as we look out and it compounds over the next couple of years and are there any opportunities for investment there, either organically or even through M&A to increase that portion of your business? Thank you for indulging all that.\nRobert Iger: I am not sure that we can give you much detail except to say that our international television business which is largely Disney branded, Disney Channel, Disney XD, Disney Junior as I mentioned on my call, 166 countries. We do have, as you mentioned, we have programs blocks that we have licensed to third party distributors in a variety of places in the world. And obviously we distribute the other content that the company owns, notably our movies and our TV shows. All of that has grown very nicely over the years and we think that it will continue to grow. We have also continued to make investments in new channels, in new markets. So we are launching a free over the air Disney Channel in Germany, we launched in Russia, we launched in Turkey. We are looking for some other opportunities there as well. But to give you some perspective on -- I just don\u2019t have the details in terms of growth trajectory or what it looks like from a margin perspective. We also look at it as brand building opportunity too, because as I mentioned a number of times, the Disney Channel has become one of the most important drivers of, basically, brand value for the company. The impact that it has not only with the programs that it puts on but essentially supporting all the other content that the company has, particularly our movies, is pretty substantial around the world. And there is value there that you don\u2019t necessarily put specifics again. But it has been a great growth engine for the company and we believe it will continue to be. Particularly, again, some of these markets that we have only launched recently and mature. Russia, a good example of that.\nJames Rasulo: Yeah. I mean what you are seeing right now in the numbers, Todd, are dilutive to our earnings in each of those. They are still all in the launch stage. Germany, Turkey, Russia and our Japan (inaudible) project, we are still in investment mode on all of those new ones. And needless to say, we wouldn\u2019t invest in those if they are not going to turn around and be accretive to our earnings down the road. As Bob said, we can't get too much in to the details of how the margins relate to our domestic business. But we are investing in growth in the international television business.\nTodd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay. I had to give it a try. Can I ask, is it material to the affiliate fee growth rate when we look at sort of low teens, 10 percentage organic. Is the international contribution, which I assume that things are growing maybe faster than that, is it material? Or if it's not, we not even think about it as we think about how that grows over the years and props up or aids the acceleration to that growth, then how we do them? Thank you.\nJames Rasulo: It was not material in Q2 Todd.\nRobert Iger: But what I will say, and I think what you can say just as you think of the future is, we have been very very aggressive over the last five years at launching new channels in many, many places. So I think while we will continue to look for opportunities to launch channels in new market as I mentioned, there will be fewer new launches in the future than there have been in the past five years. And obviously, as they mature, we move out of the investment phase and basically enter the real growth phase, then you will start to see an impact on the bottom line, both from advertising and from affiliate piece.\nOperator: Next question is Anthony DiClemente with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nAnthony DiClemente - Barclays: Just one question, turning to ESPN and your sports franchises. So I think if I have this correct, you mean the spring of next year your new MLB deal takes effect, and then in the fall of 2014 your new NFL deal and presumably new SEC network agreement kicks in. I want to ask you about the NBA deal which you share with TNT. That I think goes into a '15-'16, and I am just wondering how core the NBA is to your sports franchises. There are other national sports networks out there, Fox Sports 1, NBC Sports. They will presumably be hungry for sports content when that deal comes up. And so I just wanted to get your thoughts on that. And the other question there is, do you current affiliate renewals with the MSOs contemplate a renewal of your NBA deal in those contracts. Thank you.\nRobert Iger: The NBA deal that we currently have goes through '16. So you are off a little bit, Anthony, in your timing there. If you look at ESPN, they have locked down rights other than with the NBA, so virtually every other important sports franchise that they have for a long time. And they have also included a number of very long term affiliate agreements. So if you think about our businesses going forward, there\u2019s probably more certainty as it relates to ESPN than almost any other business that we\u2019re in, which I think generally speaking is a good thing. There are some opportunities to buy some other events and we obviously have the NBA which is an important program to us coming up. And we have a few new affiliate deals to do, but not many. But I think generally speaking ESPN is in great shape. As we look at the timing of when new contracts kick in, as you mentioned Major League Baseball and the FCC, we don\u2019t at it in a vacuum. We look at it against the timing of when new distribution deals kick in. we talked about I think more in the last quarter as it related to Comcast and new rates as a for instance. So we think that ESPN\u2019s future in terms of its growth trajectory is actually quite good and we know a lot about what it is likely to be. And I can\u2019t comment as to whether there are affiliate deals that are in any way tied to a renewal of the NBA.\nOperator: Next question is David Bank with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDavid Bank \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: Two questions. The first is, Bob, can you talk about as viewership of premium video over time, both ESPN and ABC migrates incrementally over online. How do you view the optimal -- like the optimal monetization for adding inventory on a Nielsen OCR demo sold basis versus just a gross impression. How do you think that inventory is maximized most and why? And then second, as you think about rolling out the FastPass Plus and all those new technological elements, do you think it\u2019s a better strategy to bifurcate them by offering them to resort guests or something only at first to drive higher occupancy or do you go wide for everybody with that stuff? Thank you very much.\nRobert Iger: I\u2019ll answer the second question because it\u2019s easier to answer. We have for years had in place products that are available only to hotel guests. And actually one thing that I think that Jay alluded to, didn\u2019t say specifically, is the MyMagic Plus will definitely encourage people to stay more on property than off property. Jay was talking about essentially by being able to plan ahead, people will basically have more plan with us and that will in effect discourage them from doing other things. I think it will also encourage them to stay more in our hotels. And so I think you have to look at that as an additional value to MyMagic Plus. I\u2019m not 100% sure I understand your question, the first part but let me give it a shot. I don\u2019t know that you\u2019re going to see more viewing migrating online necessarily. I think you\u2019ll see more online viewing of product, both scripted traditional entertainment and sports. We look at that as essentially a real opportunity because we think we\u2019re giving consumers, particularly consumers who have already bought the expanded basic bundle, an opportunity to choose the screen that makes most sense for us. We obviously needs to happen at the same time is we need for either Nielsen or some measurement system to kick in that adequately compensates us for the increased consumption on new devices. What we have done is we\u2019ve created selling tools and a selling structure across our businesses, including at the network by the way that is essentially selling to -- in fact we\u2019re already talking as it relates to ABC in the upfront, selling packages to advertisers that go across all media, which we\u2019ve been doing for a while at ESPN and we\u2019re doing much more aggressively at ABC and the other networks. We think that will also add value. But I think the key is for us to get a measurement system in place that enables to monetize because I\u2019m convinced that there\u2019s a lot of consumption going on there.\nOperator: Our next question is Alan Gould with Evercore Partners. Please go ahead.\nAlan Gould - Evercore Partners: A couple of park related questions real quick though. When could you conceivably get the rights back to the Marvel characters and extensions at the parks? Second, could you give us the international park revenue and operating income which I think comes in the Q. And then thirdly, the interactive division, do you still think it will breakeven with the push back of Infinity to August.\nRobert Iger: The last question, the push back of Infinity to August is doubtful that you are going to get breakeven this year. Because of when Infinity will (inaudible), which is essentially in our fourth quarter. So it potentially pushes that back. We believe in Infinity it\u2019s actually been very well received by the gaming community and by consumers and we are pleased with what we see in the product. That also resellers had really great buying for it as well. So we think it will be great product and it's going to help drive profitability for fiscal 2014. But by pushing it back it's going to make us harder to achieve profitability or breakeven this year at that division, even though the division will deliver results this year that are substantially improved from last year. Had Infinity not pushed back and Infinity had done what we expect it will do, then achieving breakeven this year was very very doable. I can't really say much about Marvel rights of the parks other than to say, the rights to the Marvel Properties, particularly in Florida, are not ours at this point. And I am not going to speculate as to not only when we will get them back or whether we will ever get them back. We have plenty of opportunity though from Marvel in other parks. We are hard at work in developing Marvel presence particularly in our international parks, notably in Hong Kong.\nJames Rasulo: Alan, in terms of revenue regarding international parks, it was $543 million this quarter. We saw growth in Paris and Hong Kong as I mentioned, because in the prior quarter we had a business interruption insurance payments in Tokyo. Our revenue there was down a little bit but the fundamentals of Tokyo Disney Resort are quite strong.\nAlan Gould - Evercore Partners: And the operating income for the international parks, Jay?\nJames Rasulo: Well, we will wait for the Q for that number, never mind.\nOperator: Next question is Michael Senno with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMichael Senno - Credit Suisse: I just wonder if you guys could quantify, as you have done in the past, the margin impact of parks from new initiatives in this quarter and if we could expect to see that continue to decelerate as the year goes on. And then second question, just in regard to the strong per cap spending. I understand there were ticket price increases but it seemed to accelerate this quarter and I just want to see if there any other particular drivers you are seeing at the parks that are resulting in that. Thanks.\nJames Rasulo: On the margin impact on new initiatives. So they are a little lumpy. This quarter they happen to be marginally accretive to the overall margins. But just modestly, to be honest with you. As I said, they are lumpy and I think next year, as everything moves into full stride, you will start to see those to be more positive drivers to margins. Your second question on spending for the quarter across all categories. Of course for caps we are helped by the holiday business that Bob mentioned, particularly Easter. But there was nothing unusual about any of the categories, they were all up across the board.\nOperator: Next question is David Miller with B. Riley & Co. Please go ahead.\nDavid Miller - B. Riley & Co.: Good call being in New York because it's raining here in Los Angeles. Jay, just following up on, I think it was Ben Swinburne's question, I think the third question in. Going back to my -- I have followed you guys for a long time and I am going back through my models here, actually in the spreadsheet all the way back to 2001. And I don\u2019t see any example of a Q2 which is your March quarter, usually your weakest quarter, ironically enough for the parks, where your margins were this high, 11.6%. I know what you are going to say, you are going to talk about the timing shift, you are going to talk about the demand curve moving to the right, I believe phase three shutdown sequences that occurred in late March. But was there anything else going on on cost that you are willing to elaborate on, because these are truly outstanding margins and I believe, correct me if I am wrong, a record for Q2. And then within that, do you guys still have a fuel hedge for the boats or has that been [unwound]? Thanks very much.\nRobert Iger: David, Jay mentioned that obviously some of the impact in Q2, the Parks, both on the margin and then on the bottom line had to do with the shift in timing of both Christmas and Easter. But I don't -- let's call it what it was. It was a great quarter for the Parks, a great quarter. There was nothing on the expense side to really note in this case, continued diligence in that regard for the parks. I think they've done a good job of managing their expenses, particularly when they've continued to invest to grow. But this was a quarter that I think stood out because the product that we recently put online really worked, like California Adventure and Fantasy Land and the shifts as we talked about. And the product that we've had online for years and years as I think in many respects just never looked better to the consumer. And in an economy that is I think seeing some slight improvement, you get results like the results that we got. I think it bodes very well for our future. As we mentioned earlier, there will be a little lumpiness in terms of margin expansion. The cost, for instance, of the MyMagic Plus we'll see in the next quarter, as for instance, some little more on Fantasy Land, but generally speaking we have a great parks story to tell. Just as an aside and we've talked a lot about California Adventure, before we redid California Adventure, at a typical day at Disneyland, the Disneyland Resort, you see about 75% of the attendants going to Disneyland and 25% going to California Adventure. That's now in most days more like 55-45. That's an incredible change and it enables us to drive real bottom-line growth because you\u2019ve got a better experience at Disneyland. We're getting pricing out of California Adventure that's substantially above what we were able to drive before. We have increased food and merch spending there. As a for instance that obviously contributes nicely to the margins. I think, I'm not sure there's any other way to categorize -- or characterize the quarter for the Company in Parks and Resorts, except to say it was a tremendous quarter.\nJames Rasulo: On your fuel hedging question, we generally hedge our fuel out of Port Canaveral. It accounts for about a third of what we will be using in terms of fuel for the cruise line this year.\nOperator: Our last question is Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.\nJason Bazinet - Citigroup: Just have a question for Mr. Iger. One of the things that always struck me as unusual about your financials on a trailing basis is how much of the growth came from Media Nets relative to the other divisions, even though if you asked a man on the street what they thought of Disney they would necessarily think of ESPN. Now that you've made all of the investments in Parks and made all the investments in IP, are we just in harvest mode now and just the investments that you've made you're just going to execute and let the strategy play out? Is that the right way to think about it or is there another pivot that you sort of see sort of on the horizon over the next three years?\nRobert Iger: That's a bit of a tricky question there, Jason. I don't want to in anyway say there is something big afoot when I answer your question by saying we're never in harvest mode per se. There are always opportunities to harvest what we've invested in. But we're in extremely dynamic businesses and a very dynamic global marketplace and there are always going to be opportunities for us, particularly given the strength of these assets, ESPN, Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars. There are going to always be opportunities for us to invest in those, to grow in a marketplace that generally is pretty robust. So I think we talked about the fact that we believe we'll able to grow free cash flow nicely. I guess in a way that's a form of harvesting. But I get a little bit concerned about using the world harvest because sometimes it suggests a status quo approach and I don't think status quo in this dynamic marketplace as we operate in is a good strategy.\nJason Bazinet - Citigroup: Well, let me recast it. Is it fair to say that Lucas acquisition was the capstone of a fairly significant strategic pivot for the firm?\nRobert Iger: I said it before it\u2019s kind of -- asking me today as we look ahead at whether there's a Pixar, a Lucas, a Marvel on the horizon, I have to say, not likely. We just don't see it. But that doesn't mean one isn't going to crop up and that we won't act opportunistically as we did on those three to take advantage of it if we see an acquisition that we believe is going to really deliver long-term value and growth for our shareholders. We feel really good about Pixar. We feel great about Marvel, not just because of this week although we have to admit that it certainly helped, but when you look ahead at what Marvel has got in the pipeline and the opportunity to monetize those properties not only across our businesses but across the world, obviously significant. We feel great about Lucas. It's been very well received. As we look at Lucas, the more we get into it, the more we realize that we've got a property in our hands that is probably more loved and more well known than almost anything else that we have which is remarkable. Remarkable that it was even available for us to buy. I don't want to say never, meaning that there is never again, or there isn't one out there. It's just much more difficult as we look ahead to sight one and I certainly wouldn't be able to mention it to you in this call. I will say that on the Marvel, and to give you maybe a little bit more of a perspective, on the Marvel and the Star Wars or the Lucasfilm acquisitions, those appeared on, I'll call it internal list of things that we thought might make real sense for this company and its shareholders for quite a long time. We looked at them very carefully. That list is shorter today than it used to be.\nRobert Iger: Thanks, Jason. Thanks again everyone for joining us today.

My name is Hilda and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note, that this conference is being recorded. I will now like to turn the call over to Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Singer, you may begin.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Good afternoon and welcome to the Walt Disney Company\u2019s fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. Our press release was issued almost 45 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today\u2019s call is also being webcast and the webcast will also be available on our website. Joining me for today\u2019s call are Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob will lead off followed by Jay and then we will of course be happy to take your questions. So with that, let me turn it over to Bob and we will get started.\nBob Iger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Lowell and good afternoon, everyone. I am happy to announce that fiscal 2014 was the biggest year in the history of the Walt Disney Company with operating income up 21% to over $13 billion and adjusted EPS up 27% to $4.32. We are obviously very pleased with this historic performance and believe it reflects the extraordinary quality of our creative content. It also demonstrates our unique ability to leverage our content across the company and to adapt to emerging consumer trends and technology. Today, I want to focus on our unrivaled content pipeline and its tremendous value in an evolving distribution environment. The accelerated advances in technology have created a new Golden age for content, with more opportunities than ever before to reach people around the world. Our extensive pipeline of branded content from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, ABC and ESPN puts us in a unique position to create significant value in this dynamic era as evidenced by our four consecutive years of record performance. Our studio business has been a tremendous content engine driving opportunity across the company. In fiscal \u201814, the studio achieved record operating income and also released four of the year\u2019s biggest movies, Frozen, Guardians of the Galaxy, Maleficent and Captain America 2. Most are franchise drivers and this focus on creating and growing franchises is even more pronounced in our slate of future releases. The most obvious example of this strategy is Marvel, which has become a strong brand since our 2009 acquisition. The five Marvel movies we have distributed to-date have averaged almost $1 billion in global box office and established two new franchises, The Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy. Marvel has a brilliant team of storytellers with incredible slate of upcoming movies that create unbelievable potential for our entire company. Starting with the long-awaited Avengers sequel, Age of Ultron which will be in theaters next May, Ant-Man will open in July, followed by Captain America 3 and Dr. Strange in 2016 and then Guardians of the Galaxy 2, Thor: Ragnarok, and Black Panther in 2017. There will also the three Marvel releases the following year, The Avengers: Infinity War Part One as well as Captain Marvel and Inhumans. And in 2019, we will release the second part of Avengers: Infinity War. And on the Star Wars front, this morning we announced the name of Episode VII, which is The Force Awakens and we are looking forward to its release on December 18 of next year. I was on the set in London just before filming wrapped and saw some exciting footage. And so far everything suggests this will be the movie Star Wars fans around the world have been waiting and hoping for. We will follow the Force Awakens with the release of our first of three standalone movies in 2016. Episode VIII will be in theaters the following year and we will complete the trilogy with Episode IX in 2019. We have got a strong slate of upcoming Disney branded movies, including our very first live-action Cinderella, which brings one of our most beloved heritage characters to life in a whole new way for a new generation. We are also looking forward to Into The Woods, Tomorrowland, The Jungle Book and Alice in Wonderland 2 as well as a new movie from our Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. And our animation is stronger than ever as well. In the last four years we have released seven major animated movies under the Disney and Pixar brands to an average global box office of $750 million, including Frozen which became the most successful animated movie of all time and a tremendous franchise. Our creative momentum continues with Disney Animation\u2019s Big Hero 6. It\u2019s a great movie and given the incredible reviews it\u2019s generating, we expect a strong opening weekend when it opens tomorrow. Next June we will release Inside Out, a truly innovative original movie from Pixar and we will follow that with three animated features in fiscal 2060. Pixar\u2019s The Good Dinosaur and Finding Dory, the sequel to Finding Nemo and Zootopia from Disney Animation. And today I am thrilled to announce that John Lasseter will direct another fantastically original Toy Story movie, Toy Story 4 will be in theaters in June 2017. John created Toy Story and directed its first two films and it\u2019s great to have him back directing one of our most valuable properties. As you know Toy Story 3 was a tremendous success generating wide critical acclaim as well as more than $1 billion in global box office and almost $10 billion in retail sales demonstrating that these wonderful characters are clearly just as relevant and beloved as ever. In fiscal \u201914, we had 11 franchises drive more than $1 billion each in retail sales and more than half of them originated from our studio. We are releasing a total of 21 tentpole movies under our great banner brands over the next three years compared to only 13 in the last three. While there is no sure thing in a creative business, we believe the proven appeal of our brands and franchises reduces risk and maximizes our unique ability to create significant long-term value by leveraging successful content across our diverse array of businesses. Turning to our media business, ABC is off to an excellent start this season. And while other networks have seen ratings trend down significantly, ABC is holding strong and is number one in C3 ratings excluding sports. We are especially pleased that the network\u2019s performance is driven by the success of shows owned by ABC Studios. Once upon a time it\u2019s up 22% year-over-year in C3 ratings for the key demo and Scandal, one of the fastest growing shows last year is also up this season. Additionally, ABC has the number one new comedy Blackish as well as the number one new drama How to Get Away with Murder. At ABC News, Good Morning America continues its reign as the number one morning show and World News with David Muir is number one in the key news demo. ESPN has locked down an extraordinary portfolio of sports rights well into the next decade, including deals with the NFL, NBA, Major League Baseball as well as the SEC, ACC, Pac-12 and Big-12. ESPN will also be home to the College Football Playoffs for the next dozen years starting with the first ever playoff in January, which is already generating a lot of buzz. Now I would like to turn to the evolving distribution landscape. The media environment is far too dynamic for anyone to expect the status quo to continue. We have clearly demonstrated our willingness and ability to be at the forefront of change impacting our industry driving technology and business models that enhance value to consumers. Given the quality of our content and the strength of our brands Disney is in a great position to thrive in any distribution environment. The multi-channel model provides compelling value to consumers, relative to a collection of SVOD and over-the-top services as evidenced by the fact that there are 101 million multichannel subscribers in the U.S. today, down only slightly from 101.5 million a year ago. Economic factors as well as technical advances and an explosion of entertainment choices drove this relatively small erosion. Consumers in most markets can get a multi-channel subscription with more than 150 channels and a wide array of diverse and quality programming for around $65 a month, a much greater value than do-it-yourself portfolio of standalone options. Between ESPN, ABC, ABC Family and Disney Channels, we own a collection of compelling broadcast and cable networks. We continue to invest in high-quality content across the board to ensure they remain relevant and valuable to viewers on any platform and we believe we are extremely well-positioned for the future. And now, I am going to let Jay walk you through the details of our fourth quarter and fiscal year. Jay?\nJay Rasulo - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Bob and good afternoon, everyone. Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding items affecting comparability, were $0.89, an increase of 16% over last year and for the fiscal year, earnings per share excluding items affecting comparability, were a record of $4.32 or 27% higher than last year. The financial results we reported in the fourth quarter and the record revenue, net income and earnings per share we posted in fiscal 2014 demonstrate how our strategy of investing in high-quality content can generate attractive financial returns across all of our businesses, while further strengthening our brands and their position in the marketplace. I am going to spend a few minutes discussing our fourth quarter results in more detail and then I will go through some key factors to consider as we look to fiscal 2015. Let\u2019s start with the studio, which had its best year ever with over $1.5 billion in operating income in fiscal 2014. Frozen was the biggest contributor to studio results in the year. However, the record studio performance in 2014 was due to broad-based success across the entire slate. And by the way, the studio\u2019s record financial performance this year was without the release of a Pixar film. Studio operating income more than doubled in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter last year due to strong performance in worldwide theatrical and home entertainment markets. Higher worldwide theatrical results reflected the performance of Guardians of the Galaxy and Maleficent in the fourth quarter compared to the performance of prior year releases. Home entertainment results reflected the strong performance of Frozen. Q4 operating income at media networks was comparable to the fourth quarter last year. Results at cable are comparable to prior year as lower operating income at ESPN was partially offset by higher operating income at worldwide Disney channels. As expected, at ESPN, higher programming costs for Major League Baseball, NFL, College Football and the World Cup more than offset higher affiliate and advertising revenue. We also incurred incremental programming costs due to the launch of the SEC Network. Domestic cable affiliate revenue in the fourth quarter was up high single-digits due primarily to higher contractual rates. Ad revenue at ESPN was up 5% in the quarter driven by an increase in units sold and higher rates partially offset by lower ratings. At broadcasting, operating income was comparable to prior year as higher affiliate revenue and higher income from program sales were largely offset by higher primetime programming costs and lower ad revenue at the ABC Network. Programming costs were higher in the quarter as a result of higher programming write-offs and a higher cost mix of programming as well as contractual rate increases. Ad revenue at the network was down low single-digits in the fourth quarter due primarily to fewer units sold. Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 12% above upfront levels. At Parks and Resorts, the investments we have made over the last couple of years, specifically in our domestic business continued to payoff. During the fourth quarter, operating income was up 20% on revenue growth of 7%. We continue to see strength in our domestic operations due to increased spending and attendance at our domestic parks and higher spending in passenger cruise days at the Disney Cruise line. Results at our international parks were lower compared to last year driven by lower results at Disneyland Paris. Disneyland Paris recently announced the recapitalization plan aimed at helping to improve its capital structure and liquidity, while enabling it to continue investing in the guest experience, which we fully support. Total segment margins were up 190 basis points in the fourth quarter and benefited by about 30 basis points due to new initiatives. As we have said in the past, we expect investments in new initiatives to be accretive to operating income and margins over time. And while two significant components of the investment plan, My Magic Plus and Shanghai Disney Resort are still in ramp up mode. The other investments are clearly making meaningful contributions to the segment\u2019s results. The early returns we are seeing from MyMagic+ are encouraging. During the fourth quarter MyMagic+ had a positive contribution to year-over-year increase in the segment\u2019s operating income. We continued to see positive trends in the business with the fourth quarter per capita spending in our domestic parks up 6% on higher ticket prices, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 4% with Walt Disney World setting a new fourth quarter record. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 5% and occupancy was up 5 percentage points to 83%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 11% compared to prior year levels, while book rates are up 3%. The 11% includes the benefit of the timing of promotional offers. But nevertheless, we feel very good about the volume and pricing trends we are seeing in the business. Our consumer products business continues to benefit from strong merchandise sales. In the fourth quarter growth in operating income was driven by the sales of Frozen and Spiderman merchandise. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up 10%. At the Interactive segment, operating income was comparable to the prior year as strong results from our Japan games business and the recognition of a minimum guarantee were largely offset by lower Infinity sales driven by the timing of the release of Infinity 2.0. As you recall Infinity 2.0 was released in late September this year, so we had a shorter window for selling into retail versus Infinity 1.0, which was released during the middle of August last year. We are very pleased with the results of the first installment of the game and we feel good about the launch of the second installment thus far. But we will have a better sense of overall performance as we enter the holiday season. During the fourth quarter we repurchased 16.4 million shares for about $1.4 billion and for fiscal 2014 we repurchased 84.4 million shares for $6.5 billion. Before I conclude let me proactively address a couple of questions you may have about 2015. We expect total consolidated CapEx in 2015 to be about $1.5 billion higher than in 2014 or up $1.1 billion adjusted for the contribution from our Shanghai partner. The increasing CapEx is primarily due to the ongoing investment in Shanghai Disney Resort. We expect cable programming cost to grow low-teen percentage points in fiscal 2015, primarily driven by the first year of both our new NFL and College Football Playoff contracts. The increase will be heavily skewed towards the first half of the year given the timing of the NFL and College Football seasons. Total segment operating income in fiscal 2015 will be adversely impacted by about $225 million due to higher pension expense and a negative impact from FX. We will benefit from the 53rd week in our accounting calendar which will fall in the fiscal fourth quarter. Also in 2015, we expect to continue to return capital to our shareholders via share repurchase and dividends. So far this year, we have opportunistically purchased 11.3 million shares for $970 million. Fiscal 2014 was a record year for our company and as Bob discussed there is much to look forward to in fiscal 2015 and beyond. And with that I will now turn the call over to Lowell for Q&A.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Alright. Thanks Jay. Operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nTodd Juenger - Sanford Bernstein: Hi, thanks. Two questions if you don\u2019t mind, both on the same theme, which is around affiliate fees of the cable networks. So Bob you gave a rather impassioned defense and advocation for the value of the bundle as it exists. I know in recent quarters at least in most recent quarter you had a comment around how some trading down to lower bundles or skinnier packages did have \u2013 did make the list of things that had hurt affiliate fees at ESPN and I think in the past quarter. I didn\u2019t see that on the list today. So, I just wonder if there is any update on sort of the trends or any more evidence of the growth of people seeking those lower bundles. And then the very quick follow-up if you don\u2019t mind, Jay, I don\u2019t know if you are willing to comment anything specifically on affiliate fees in Q4, just how they paced and any puts and takes on that? Thanks.\nBob Iger: We saw, Todd, some modest erosion of the expanded basic bundle, but it wasn\u2019t a driver of earnings the quarter that we just announced. And I did have some bullish comments to make, because if you look at the numbers and you see that 101 million households have some form of multi-channel bundle, it\u2019s still clearly the dominant entertainment or television package in the home. And we think that\u2019s going to continue to this foreseeable future. And while clearly the economy has had some impact over the last few years and we do see the millennials seem to be becoming subscribers a little bit later than perhaps they used to, we just feel that when you look at the quality of what\u2019s offered meaning the number of channels and the programming across those channels and you consider the price that, that is likely to remain dominant for a long time. Jay, you want to\u2026\nJay Rasulo: Yes. And on the cable affiliate revenue growth, Todd, as I said last quarter, we expected to see high single-digit growth in the fourth quarter and in fact domestically we did see that on a high single-digit growth mostly due to contractual rates increases.\nTodd Juenger - Sanford Bernstein: Okay, thank you for that color. Thanks.\nBob Iger: Todd, you are welcome. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson: Thanks. I have one for Bob and one for Jay. Bob, last month, the news came out that you are extending your contract for 2 more years. And in the past, when we have asked you about your priorities, you have said that you wanted sort of Shanghai and Star Wars would be successfully opened. So, now that you are staying for a few more years, what other priorities are you going to add to that list of things that you are focused on?\nBob Iger: Well, thank you for the question. When I got this job almost 10 years ago, there were three priorities. One was to make great content, high-quality branded content and to put most of our capital in that. Second was to use technology to distribute more broadly to make our company more efficient to get closer to the customer and to innovate, meaning to make our products better through innovation and to create new products. And the third was to grow internationally. And it\u2019s interesting that here I am essentially almost 10 years after becoming CEO and those are still the priorities. We look at the movie slate and you look at Star Wars and you look at Marvel and you look at what we are doing with Disney Animation and Pixar, there is no better example probably in terms of the first priority than that. And of course, Star Wars is something particularly for the first film since we have purchased Lucasfilm. That is the priority. But I talked on an earlier interview about our movie slate. We have great visibility at the studio to our movie slate between now and 2020. I mentioned that over the next 3 years we have got 21 tentpoles versus 13 in the last 3 years. But if you look at the lineup that is not only they have been talked about, but we have actually put into production. We got writers and directors and titles in development, it\u2019s unbelievably strong. And that ability, because you know to \u2013 well, the ability of the company has to leverage that across our businesses should drive great growth. So, there is nothing probably greater from a priority perspective than that. Shanghai Disneyland represents our best international growth initiative in a long time and it\u2019s rising from the ground as we speak in a pretty compelling way, because of its size and the innovation and the breadth of its quality. And we hope to be able announce an opening date sometime early 2015 meaning when the data that we will open. We think that will be a great driver of growth in China and we believe that we have got more opportunities in Asia, not just in China, but in other markets for the company. So, international continues to be a priority. And then on the technology front, we took stock fairly recently at the technology and the technological efforts across our company. And even we were blown away by the scale Disney Movies Anywhere is just one recent example of that. The MagicBand is another. When you see Big Hero 6 and you see where we have taken the quality of Disney Animation that\u2019s another one. So I don\u2019t intend actually to change my priorities at all in the remaining three and a half years that I am in this position. And I am really excited about not only what we have got in store, but what those priorities have meant for the company in terms of creating value in the past nine years.\nMichael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson: Thanks Bob. Let me ask Jay, following on the Shanghai comments, Jay when you look in this fiscal year coming up, what is the impact on Shanghai on the operating expenses on the park side. I know you have been building expenses as you have not opened, but it had operating expenses, so how do you think about that in \u201915?\nJay Rasulo: Well, Michael you know at the outset, when we announced the building of this park. We said there would be $300 million to $400 million of expenses that were part of that overall spend and that tends to be very back loaded because a lot of those expenses are the hiring, training and pre-opening rehearsals if you will before we start taking in revenue for the park. So they are very back-loaded and we also believe that when we announced the opening date, we will have a better fix on exactly how those numbers will affect fiscal \u201915. But you should assume that they will be pretty significant. But the good news is, is that as MyMagic+ ramps up in terms of overall new initiatives, we hope that the benefits from that project will actually offset if you are looking at the segment as a whole, the incremental costs that we are going to take on for Shanghai Disneyland. So, I don\u2019t think on balance, they are going to be a huge driver in your model for park returns for the year.\nMichael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson: Okay. Thanks Jay.\nLowell Singer: Yes. Thank you, Michael. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.\nAlexia Quadrani - JPMorgan: Thank you. With so many great brands gaining momentum here that we are seeing, like how should we think about the consumer products business long-term and specifically how much of a positive influence might the opening of Shanghai Disney have on the growth opportunities in consumer products in China?\nBob Iger: Well, I don\u2019t think that the opening of Shanghai Disney will have an appreciable impact on consumer products in China. What\u2019s having the best impact and what will continue to have strong impact on consumer products in China is the movie business, as you know China has become among the largest movie markets in the world. I think it\u2019s second. It probably will be for sometime in the next five years. They continue to open screens at an unbelievable pace. Our films have done extremely well in China. Particularly the films that drive success to consumer products are retail \u2013 Disney and Pixar, Marvel. We believe Star Wars will do the same thing that. So we are quite excited about that. If you look at consumer products overall their growth in the last three years has been stunning, it\u2019s actually been over 20% over the last three years, which I think has gone largely unappreciated and unrecognized. The movies that we have been talking about the more successful ones this past year of course led by Frozen, with the Marvel Films Captain America, Guardians of the Galaxy, Maleficent are all drivers of the consumer products business. The Marvel slate that we just announced, what we talked about was Star Wars they will be as well. But then we have other creative content engines of the company that are also helping consumer products Disney Junior is another example of that, when you look at Doc McStuffins and a variety of other products coming out of the Disney channel organization. So, consumer products right now, has a wealth of properties or intellectual property to mine across the board meaning in so many categories. And I just asked the other day our head of consumer products what the outlook is for Christmas season. And he said that our stores in the United States and Japan and Europe \u2013 I emphasize Europe, because everybody has been talking about the woes of the European economy. But even our European stores are comping up significantly over a year ago. And buying at mass retail across the globe for our consumer products is also extremely strong going to the holiday season. And I think they have done a great job of mining our IP and creating some of their own. And we are going to look to continued growth from that unit over the next 3 to 5 years.\nAlexia Quadrani - JPMorgan: Thank you. And just a quick follow-up for Jay if I can I think this time last year Jay you gave us some range for buyback going into the year I guess is there anyway you can sort of give us some sense of how we could expect the buyback to be in fiscal \u201915?\nJay Rasulo: Well, I am not going to \u2013 I am not going to make you happy with my answer, because I am really not going to give you any guidance into what the level of buyback would be. But I will remind you of this, we have said that over the long run we look towards about 20% of the cash generated by the company being a return to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. We have been very much on track with that. You know what the numbers have looked like over the last 3 years that have been in that range between $3 billion and this year\u2019s $6.5 billion on an annual basis. You saw that we opportunistically given what happened in the marketplace, we opportunistically took a big buyback in so far this fiscal quarter, I would not look to that number for guidance on what the whole year would look like in terms of the pace. But obviously we will \u2013 we meet the board on this subject. That meeting is coming up and we haven\u2019t \u2013 we have neither made a decision as to what the level will be yet nor am I inclined to announce that, but as I said part of our fundamental philosophy has been to use that vehicle on an opportunistic basis to return capital to the shareholders.\nAlexia Quadrani - JPMorgan: Thank you.\nBob Iger: Thanks, Alexia. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from David Bank from RBC Capital Markets.\nDavid Bank - RBC Capital Markets: Hey, thanks very much. Two questions. I guess the first one for Jay. Jay, can you talk about the progress or the \u2013 I guess the progress on Maker. Now, it\u2019s been part of the portfolio for 6 months or sooner or a little more than that, how are you tracking kind of the earn-out progress and how are you using the Maker audience? Are you directing it to other audiences within the Disney portfolio? How are you monetizing it beyond just the impressions on Maker? And then second question, I know you can\u2019t give us guidance on the studio earnings run-rate that I always ask for, but when you think about \u2013 you have such great visibility into the film slate for the next 5 years. When you think about what those films cost, from the past couple of years and what the P&A spend has been both negative cost of P&A, do the expense profiles of the upcoming slate look pretty similar to the ones that we have just had. So, would the profitability per film tend to be about the same on average? Thanks very much.\nJay Rasulo: Okay, thanks David. Let me start with Maker. So, as you know, we don\u2019t report Maker\u2019s financials and I am going to get into details there, but I can tell you from a progress report perspective, it is notable how well integrated Maker\u2019s efforts have been across all of the segments of the company. They have engaged with every segment of the company and are beginning to mind the opportunities that each of those seconds have whether it\u2019s IP, whether it\u2019s better distribution, whether it\u2019s taking content and envisioning short form applications of that content. They have also really put their shoulders to the wheel on the marketing front. And I think that Guardians of the Galaxy and the fact that they are way out ahead of it in their space was a perfect example of the kind of marketing that you can have on distribution vehicles like maker.tv and YouTube, which are ubiquitous and really target the audience for a lot of our films. So, I think that so far we are extremely pleased with how integrated they have become into all of the thinking around the use of the platform that they are so predominant in and how their skill base both on the analytics side and as well as the content side in terms of short form, is showing real promise moving forward. So, stay tuned there and I think you will see a lot more. On the studio side, in terms of I guess the ultimately what was your question, do we envision that the kinds of films that we announced from an expense perspective and ultimately I guess I would like to lean towards the P&L and return perspective, will they look like the incredible successes we have had with these franchise films in the past? And I think the answer is yes, that we do see a similar cost profile in terms of both the negative cost and the likely range of P&A, but more importantly, when these films hit their ultimates, with every part company whether it is spin-off of work in other divisions, whether it\u2019s consumer products, the rates of returns on these films are staggering as you can imagine. And that\u2019s why we are in the much more limited slate dedicated to franchise and branded films business that we are in, because we like the way the economic profile looks and we like the kinds of returns they deliver.\nDavid Bank - RBC Capital Markets: That\u2019s exactly what I was looking for. Thank you.\nBob Iger: David, thank you for the question. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.\nJessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thanks. I have two questions. I was hoping you could comment on some of the impact of some of the bigger global issues like the strong dollar, lower gas prices on your parks and if you could on your other businesses? And then secondly, you haven\u2019t gotten the advertising question yet. So, clearly, if you have listened to any of the other video company calls, there is tons of concern about what\u2019s going on, how much is cyclical, how much is secular? But you probably actually are enjoying a very solid advertising. So, I\u2019d love to get your views of not only the current marketplace, but how you see share shifts in different evolving models?\nBob Iger: I will take the advertising question. Jay can answer the other part of your question, Jessica. And I will break it down between the ESPN and ABC, although I think they both are experiencing a marketplace that has similar characteristics. First of all, from the secular cyclical question or angle, I\u2019d say there is no question that some money has siphoned out of traditional media and on to digital platforms. We know that, because we have taken advantage of it with our digital presence. We also know it, because we are an advertiser and a substantial component of our advertising buys, particularly the studio and our theme parks is digital. Even though by the way, there is still a little less data than we would like to back that up, but digital has become a large component of most advertising campaigns or a component. And that came from somewhere. That said there is still huge value in the 30-second spot, which we are seeing particularly when the spot runs in high-quality programming. The other thing that I think is the dynamic that I have heard both from our sales people, but also from the advertising community in general is that many advertisers are now resorting to far more surgical approaches to developing their media campaigns in their buys than ever before and there are sophisticated procurement procedures in place behind that. So, I have heard complaints from an advertising executive fairly recently that all of his clients are using procurement officers. We have seen that too in terms of selling ads and that\u2019s changed the buying patterns a little bit. The other thing I will add on the secular side is the marketplace right now is I will call it out mildly off or soft. On the ESPN front, we are not really declaring that a trend. We have a very, very strong upfront at ESPN and we have properties on ESPN that are selling extremely well, notably the NBA, College Football leading into the college playoffs, which is a really hot property. So, our outlook for the advertising marketplace from ESPN\u2019s perspective for the year is actually not bad. On the ABC front, similar story and that the marketplace today has scattered not great, but when you have Scandal and other returning shows on ABC and you have hot new shows in Blackish and How to Get Away with Murder, you have got really high-quality shows, including by the way, Good Morning America, which has done extremely well in the ratings, now World News Tonight, which is doing quite well. Our sales team has a lot of good product to sell. And so when you ask them their outlook, it\u2019s actually not that bad.\nJessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Right.\nBob Iger: Jay, you want to?\nJay Rasulo: Yes. On \u2013 let me take your question, Jessica in two parts. First, oil prices, we have over the years been asked a lot of questions about oil prices. And I can tell you that it other than an indicator of overall economic activity, oil prices per se have never been a real driver for our business either on the upside or the downside. So, I don\u2019t expect there to be big movement, particularly in our parks and resorts business, where that people tend to believe that, that would be very relevant. I don\u2019t expect that to be a driver as it\u2019s never been before on much more dire situations. In terms of the strength of the dollar, obviously I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we have an FX impact coming up. We have also had one this year, it was part of the reason for instance that parks \u2013 international parks was down due to the weakness of the yen. Obviously we took the Venezuela devaluation this past year below line. And we expect to see a not gigantic but an impact from basically the conversion of our business \u2013 our foreign businesses into dollars. If you look on the other hand relative to the impact of the stronger dollar on our parks business this year \u2013 this quarter we happened to be kind of at the high end of the range that I usually talk about in terms of percent of international attendance at our parks, which tends to be between 18% and 22%. We are at the very high end of that. So I would say that that has not yet affected individual consumption. There are lots of other things that drive that that are more economically driven, I think than exchange rates. So we will stay tuned, but I \u2013 we don\u2019t see any fundamental impacts on our business yet.\nJessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Thanks Jessica. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi.\nJason Bazinet - Citi: Thanks. Just a question for Mr. Iger, at the press event that you had when you rolled out your Marvel slate, I had a chance to speak to some of your most avid Marvel fans. And one of the young gentlemen framed three studio acquisitions you have done in the last eight years in an interesting way. It went like this; that Marvel was actually the least risky, because you bought intellectual property and talent; Pixar, you really weren\u2019t buying IP, you were just buying moviemaking talent; but Lucas in a way was actually the most risky because you were just buying intellectual property, but no talent. And so I know that\u2019s somewhat simplistic formulation, but can you just remind us or walk us through the steps that you are taking today to ensure that the Star Wars films are successful in terms of the talent you are putting there?\nBob Iger: Well, interesting assessment because I think about Pixar and Marvel that\u2019s largely correct. There was IP too at Pixar in the sense that there were great movies that have been made Nemo and Toy Story and Monsters and Incredibles that had the potential for sequels and today we announced Toy Story 4 as one example of that. And when we bought Pixar we weren\u2019t guaranteeing we are going to make those sequels. We thought with the companies combined there was a better shot of making them and making them well. And I think we have proven certainly that that was true. Marvel came with a brain trust, which is I guess another way to put it to steal a Pixar term of moviemaking talent that was extremely impressive, something that I learned very early on in the exploration process. And so as you said it was a combination of the brand and the storytelling and the affinity for those stories that people had with this great moviemaking talent and a real discipline. We don\u2019t think it was necessarily a no-brainer because there is still a lot of work that goes into it. But we certainly believe that if you are looking at a business that is inherently a risky business because of creativity, we are actually reducing the risk. In Star Wars, there is no stronger IP in terms of the passion that people have for storytelling characters and a brand I think than Star Wars. And we are seeing that already. It\u2019s actually exceeded the expectations that we had when we made the acquisition. We knew with that we couldn\u2019t just essentially say we are making a movie and end up with a great one that there was a lot of care that went into it and we are fortunate to have Kathy Kennedy to manage that process. But we also knew that that IP would attract great moviemaking talent. And J.J. Abrams is a good example of that. Now, there wasn\u2019t a long list of people that wanted to direct Star Wars films because that\u2019s a tall order. There is a lot of pressure on those folks to do so. We are fairly certain they would be long enough and that the talent interested in doing it would be strong enough that we will be in good shape. And we are really pleased that a combination of the writing team J.J., Kathy and everyone else that\u2019s been involved in the creative on the Star Wars film is really delivering which we can\u2019t wait to prove to everybody next December.\nJason Bazinet - Citi: Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer: Jason, thanks for the question. Operator next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.\nBen Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Thanks. I have two related to ESPN, Bob there were some comments from Time Warner yesterday about the potential for an over-the-top service from ESPN including the NBA and how that product might look, but obviously we would love to hear from you what you and the folks at ESPN are thinking about in trying to attack the broadband-only sub base which maybe growing in the U.S. as you put rights together and think about packaging and pricing ESPN over-the-top? And related maybe for Jay, you have guidance of high single-digit OI growth for cable \u201814 through \u201816 and you just did I think 7% reported this year. You said that programming costs would be up teens, so that\u2019s an acceleration. So, I am wondering is that CAGR sort of are we going to see a step down in \u201815 and then a reacceleration in \u201816 to hit that high single-digit number? It would seem that might make sense mathematically given the programming cost comments you made.\nBob Iger: Ben, the whole issue of the sustainability of the bundle over-the-top, the impact of new technology is a really interesting one and a tricky one. ESPN has got a few priorities. First of all, buy great product and buy a broad array of rights that gives them the flexibility to essentially exhibit those rights in multiple forms of media, so that they have the ability to essentially adjust or adapt to the changing media universe, thanks to technology. The second thing they want to do is they want to engage more with their consumers. That essentially means be present on new platforms in a robust way and get closer to the consumer. And I said this in an interview earlier too no traditional media company has done a better job at going digital in ESPN. We see that on the bottom line with huge growth in advertising revenue. We see it in numbers \u2013 ESPN\u2019s uniques basically off channel are just staggering in terms of their numbers. That said, we also have a priority and that is to do whatever we can to make sure that, that multi-channel bundle is sustainable and valuable and continues to add value to consumers, because it is a more competitive marketplace today than it has ever been. So, we don\u2019t feel a compelling need to take a product to market right now. That is a direct challenge to that multi-channel bundle in part because if the bundle were to break up, which we don\u2019t foresee happening anytime soon, we are very well-positioned to move very quickly to take advantage of, I will call it a broadband-only universe or an a la carte universe because of the strength of the brand, the programming, the rights that we have bought. There is no need to do it now in a way that precipitates the downfall of that bundle. Bragging rights to say we are doing it to say that we are \u2013 we have already established as a company we are pro-technology. We have probably been at the forefront of it from a media perspective in terms of leading change and adapting to change, but you do it to a point where if you do it to a point, where you are endangering your own business model, which is already facing a fair amount of challenge, because of all of the changing dynamics of the media landscape. It just doesn\u2019t seem to make sense to us right now. We are ready to do it if we have to. There maybe some experimenting with new product. We are going to create new product like the NBA over-the-top that is designed as add-ons. It\u2019s not designed to \u2013 the package of the NBA games that\u2019s going to be on ESPN will be stronger than what we will ever offer on an over-the-top package, including the finals which will be on ABC and a good part of the postseason. If you are really a great NBA fan, you are not going to \u2013 your over-the-top package isn\u2019t going to satisfy you enough, it may enhance your connection to or your enjoyment of the sport, but it\u2019s not going to replace it. And that\u2019s how we are looking at it. I think it\u2019s interesting, because I think that some may call that a conservative approach. We think it\u2019s actually a smart approach, because we are going to continue to grow our digital offerings nicely, but we are also going to work really hard at making sure that, that bundle is viable. Interesting, what we have done on the mobile side with the WATCH apps is one great example of that. We have got really compelling product that is available. You can watch on a computer or a great new mobile device if you are a subscriber and that makes subscribing that much more valuable. And I also want to say it\u2019s not just about ESPN, you look at ABC and you look at Disney and other potential products that we could create as a company under the Marvel and the Star Wars brand, we will be well-positioned to go direct to the consumer or with a la carte offerings if the marketplace demands it, but we don\u2019t feel a great need to that now.\nBen Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Thank you, Bob.\nJay Rasulo: And Ben, relative to the perspective on the OI at ESPN, I guess I will say this, I am not going to change the guidance that we gave on the Investor Day relative to the compound annual growth rate out through \u201916. But as a way of perspective I think it\u2019s worth noting as you think about this but obviously over the next two years, the first year of those we have talked about the step up in costs that we are facing we kind of articulated those in the prepared remarks, but whether it\u2019s NFL or Major League Baseball the costs of the College Playoffs \u2013 College Football Playoffs, the SEC those were all step ups in costs that we will see this year which when we look a year from now at fiscal \u201916, obviously comping against those you won\u2019t see that as an increase in the relative cost base. So I think maybe that can give you some perspective on how to think about sort of the path to that overall compounded growth guidance.\nBen Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Thank you, both.\nLowell Singer: Ben, thank you. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Janedis from Jefferies.\nJohn Janedis - Jefferies: Hi. Thank you. Maybe a related question on advertising and sports it seems like the number of hours of live sports has increased probably appreciably across TV this year and so I am wondering are you sensing any kind of sports fatigue or pricing flexibility in the market from either an advertiser or a ratings perspective?\nBob Iger: No we are not \u2013 not really ESPN\u2019s line up of sports is fantastic. Actually, I am talking to their sales group about the current marketplace. One of the things they emphasized is the strength of their hand from a programming perspective in a marketplace that I said is at least at the moment not all that great. We do know that live programming has a lot of value to advertisers. And in the ESPN\u2019s case, it\u2019s got a great demo with men. So that\u2019s also quite attractive. So we are not seeing what you described.\nJohn Janedis - Jefferies: Okay. Thanks Bob. Maybe a related question, I think there is something like 33 games in \u2013 at the SEC Network, so I know it\u2019s early but can you talk about how you view the network\u2019s performance and to what extent you are seeing some of your traditional ESPN advertisers may be spending on the SEC Network as well?\nBob Iger: So far what we have seen and we are not prepared to be public with any numbers, it\u2019s been very, very encouraging both their football game performance and adjunct programming around it. They actually have a great SEC nation show, I think it\u2019s called SEC Nation, which is tremendous and they are doing quite well. I don\u2019t have any facts to address the second part of your question about whether we have cannibalized ourselves from an advertising perspective. I do know that we have moved some games from what would have been on ESPN or ESPN2 on to the SEC Network but that had always been the plan. It\u2019s also nice that this network is launched in the year that the SEC has been even stronger than it is traditional \u2013 it has traditionally been and that\u2019s actually \u2013 if ever there was a great time to launch this network it\u2019s now.\nJohn Janedis - Jefferies: Alright. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Thank you. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Nomura.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura: Thanks. One for Jay and one for Bob, here you guys on the really constructive commentary on the ad sales outlook for ESPN I was just wondering Jay if maybe you give us given ad pacing, specifically for the December quarter if you have it that would be great. And then I mean there have been a lot of great questions on this call in terms of changing media ecosystem, I thought maybe I would ask about the soft ratings in cable and Bob maybe you guys mentioned that the ratings at ESPN in the quarter that you just reported but more broadly in terms of cable ratings I mean you sit at the top you have a very robust internal research team at Disney, what\u2019s your best explanation for the accelerating, declining ratings over the summer. And if you will which are in your opinion the digital platforms that are taking the biggest share of those eyeballs be it ad supported, subscription video formats or EST formats online? Thanks.\nJay Rasulo: Yes. Hi, Anthony, first let me talk about your question on advertising. So I am going to reiterate a little bit about what Bob said because I want to put it in context. First ESPN had a very strong upfront in terms of both volume and pricing. And we are seeing \u2013 he talked about NBA advertising were up like 21% year-on-year in NBA advertising. And the excitement about College Football Playoff series is palpable. I will say though that we are looking at a very late moving market in advertising. I think you have talked to the different media companies. You have heard this over and over that people are committing cash late, which makes it very hard to read what the numbers really are going to wind up for the quarter, but suffice to say that, there is a little bit of softness in the pacings. They are slightly down to the tune, I would call it, low to mid single-digits for ESPN, but I think that we are optimistic that as the quarter comes to its end and those events that I just mentioned take hold that we may feel better about it at the end of the quarter, but right now we are down slightly.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura: Okay.\nBob Iger: On the ratings front, we have seen some ratings erosion. I actually don\u2019t want to jump to too many conclusions, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to compare a season to a season meaning this year versus last year and all of a sudden declare it a trend. I do know at the Disney Channel, where we have seen some ratings fall off. We have had less original programming, that\u2019s more a timing issue than anything else and we are not concerned about it. In terms of where competition is coming from and where we see, I guess, the competition the greatest. You have to conclude that it\u2019s from all over the place, just it\u2019s a very, very competitive fragmented marketplace that has people consuming media from multiple sources on multiple devices and multiple platforms across the board. And if I were to conclude anything there, it would be that the haves or the better brands with the stronger programming will endure even if they see some erosion. The product that is in danger are the products that is marginal in nature, that is either unbranded or does not have the kind of audience affinity or built-in audience affinity than many of the other channel type. I actually think when you think about the health of the bundle as well, while if the bundle were to fray or break up, everyone would suffer. The ones that will suffer the most are those smaller, less branded, less popular channels. By the way, they are not going to suffer, they are going to disappear. In an a la carte world, they completely disappear. So, interestingly enough what happens in a la carte is much lower choice from traditional platforms or traditional programmers and just even more fragmentation, but everybody talks about diversity and everybody talks about variety and that goes away. It\u2019s that simple. We like our position, because of ABC and Disney and Pixar and Marvel and obviously Lucasfilm and Star Wars, because they are branded and in the world where there is substantially greater choice whether you are looking at movies, whether you are looking at television, whether you are looking at apps, whether you are looking at Internet sites, we think we are fairly well-positioned there, because of the value of those brands.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura: Thank you very much.\nBob Iger: And with that, we will conclude our broadcast day.\nLowell Singer: Operator, we will take one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Tim Nollen from Macquarie.\nTim Nollen - Macquarie: Hi, thank you very much. I wanted to ask also about advertising and I am particularly interested in your position with ESPN, which is very much obviously about live sports, and then ABC which faces some of the same broadcast issues as its peers. My question is how are you thinking about alternative measurement for these two networks? ESPN being very much about out of home and mobile, ABC being perhaps more about time shifted. I guess, what will it take to fully adapt and commercialize new ratings methodology so that we can start to really finally close the gap between what I think real viewership is, which is not declining that much versus your ability to actually monetize these networks? Thanks.\nBob Iger: That\u2019s a very good question. And it describes a very frustrating situation in a way, because we know there is more consumption, but the measurement isn\u2019t there to back it up. And there is some data available, but it doesn\u2019t cum the audience with what\u2019s on the network. And so it\u2019s harder to use, in other words, we were to try to figure out who is watching Scandal on the WATCH app and who is watching Scandal on the network. We get numbers from both, but it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be cum numbers and it could be some all kinds of duplication. So, right now, it is not a particularly positive situation. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to take, except probably significant investment to come up with numbers that really reflect where consumption is today, which I think would be quite important and quite interesting for those that sell advertising time and those that buy advertising time. And I can\u2019t predict when or even if that\u2019s going to happen, but I am assuming at some point the marketplace is going to demand it and it will develop, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be anywhere and it\u2019s not inside at the moment.\nTim Nollen - Macquarie: Are you saying we need different types of measurement to capture that or is it just simply not being used effectively enough by the industry as a whole?\nBob Iger: What I would say, I am not a tremendous expert on this, but my sense is we need a different type of measurement that doesn\u2019t exist today which will take investment.\nTim Nollen - Macquarie: Okay, thank you.\nBob Iger: Thank you, Tim.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Thanks, again everyone for joining us today.

Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Singer, you may begin.\nLowell Singer:  Thanks, and good afternoon everybody. Welcome to the Walt Disney Company's third quarter 2014 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 45 minutes ago and is available on our Web site at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and a recording and a transcript of the webcast will also be available on our Web site. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob is going to lead off followed by Jay, and then of course we will be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob, and we will begin.\nBob Iger:  Thanks Lowell and good afternoon everyone. We delivered the highest quarter in the history of the Walt Disney Company with adjusted EPS of $1.28 and we\u2019ve generated greater EPS in the first three quarters of fiscal 2014 than we have in any previous full fiscal year. As evidenced by these results, we remain committed to building strong brands and growing franchises, a strategy that is creating value across the Company. On top of this earnings report this week, we\u2019re especially excited about the fantastic debut of Marvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy with $181 million in global box office so far. Domestically Guardians delivered the biggest August opening weekend ever and with Monday added in, it did over $106 million. This result reinforces what we\u2019ve known for a while and that is that we have incredibly talented people making films for and with Marvel. Combined with a very strong brand and a rich array of characters and stories, the future for Marvel is incredibly exciting. We\u2019re looking forward to Avengers 2 next May. The footage we shared at Comic-Con was a huge hit with fans. We\u2019ll follow Avengers with Ant-Man in July, then Captain America 3 in May of \u201916, and last week we announced we are going to make a sequel to Guardians. We see great promise in Guardians as another fantastic Marvel franchise. We also have strong franchises from Pixar and Walt Disney Studios, Disney Animation and Lucasfilm, truly an unprecedented collection and we\u2019re seeing the impact across the Company. For example Disney Consumer Products just delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in both revenue and operating income and we have multiple franchises that have already generated more than $1 billion each in retail sales so far this year and we\u2019re very excited about our new line Frozen merchandise coming this holiday season. This quarter also marked Disney Interactive\u2019s fourth straight quarter of profitability. Disney Infinity continues to be a key driver and will add Marvel characters including Guardians of the Galaxy to the Infinity Universe when Disney Infinity 2 launches next month. Turning to theme parks, progress continues on Shanghai Disney Resort. This our most ambitious project ever and we\u2019re thrilled with the way this spectacular destination is coming along. We hope to set an official date for our grand opening sometime within the next six months or so. At Walt Disney World, this was the first full quarter in MyMagic+ was available to all guests. About half of the guests now use MagicBands and 90% of them rate the experience as excellent or very good. We\u2019re very pleased with the growing popularity of MyMagic+ and expect it to contribute to parks earnings growth starting in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re also developing ideas and designs for a far greater Star Wars presence in our parks. We expect to provide details about this sometime next year. Production on Star Wars Episode 7 is on track and the footage we have seen so far is spectacular, certainly worthy for the fan frenzy and excitement this movie is generating around the world. Episode 7 will open on December 18, 2015. So Star Wars fans who have been waiting a decade for a new movie only have about another 500 days to go. Until then they can enjoy Star Wars Rebels, a new series launching on Disney XD this fall. Turning to ESPN, this spectacular 2014 World Cup once again demonstrated the value of having the number one sports brand covering the world\u2019s biggest sporting events. With its unprecedented reach across all platforms, ESPN delivered the most watched World Cup ever on English language TV here in the U.S. and with almost 44 million hours of live viewing on WatchESPN, this year\u2019s World Cup was the most streamed sporting event in history. In the month of June alone, an astounding 80 million people connected to ESPN via computers and mobile devices to keep up with the World Cup and other sporting events such as the NBA Finals, the NBA Drafts, the US Open, Wimbledon and major league baseball games. ESPN\u2019s new SEC network will debut in almost 60 million homes nationwide on August 14th making it one of the most successful launches in cable TV history, making a lot of sports fans extremely happy. We\u2019re obviously very proud of our performance this quarter. It's satisfying to see the growing impact of our strategic focus on building strong sustainable franchises across all of our brands and businesses, as also long term growth opportunity that is unique to Disney and one that we'll continue leveraging to deliver results and create greater value for our company and our shareholders. Now I am going to turn the call over to Jay to talk about the details of our Q3 performance. Jay?\nJay Rasulo: Thanks Bob and good afternoon everyone. We delivered yet another strong quarter of financial performance with record third quarter earnings per share of $1.28. The strong performance in the quarter was broad based with operating income growth and margin expansion at studio entertainment, parks and resorts, broadcasting, consumer products and interactive media. As expected, our cable business was adversely impacted by higher programming costs at ESPN. Let\u2019s start with studio entertainment. Our operating income doubled in the third quarter compared to last year. For the second quarter in a row, Frozen was the biggest contributor to growth in segment operating income at the studio due to its performance at the international box office and at worldwide home entertainment, where it drove higher profits per unit as well as an increase in unit sales. Operating income at media networks was comparable to the prior year as an increase in broadcasting was offset by a decrease of cable. Operating income at broadcasting was up nicely due to higher affiliate revenue and increased operating income and program sales due to lower amortization expense and higher revenue from Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Ad revenue at the network was up in the third quarter. So far this quarter scatter pricing at the network is running mid-single digits above upfront levels. Turning to cable, operating income was lower in the quarter as a result of higher programming and production cost at ESPN, lower recognition of previously deferred affiliate revenue and the absence of contribution from ESPN UK which as you know we sold in the fourth quarter last year. The impact of these factors was partially offset by higher affiliate rates and advertising revenue. Higher programming and production costs were driven by increases from Major League Baseball due to first year of our new contract and the World Cup. These higher costs were partially offset by the absence of both ESPN UK rights and production cost for the global X Games. Domestic cable affiliate revenue in the third quarter was comparable to the prior year due primarily to the adverse impact of the timing of program covenants. At the time of our Q2 earnings call, we expected ESPN to recognize $190 million less in previously deferred affiliate revenue for the third quarter. As it turned out, ESPN recognized only $98 million less, as ESPN met certain program commitments during Q3. As a result of this shift, ESPN has now recognized all previously deferred affiliate revenue for the year. So like last year, ESPN will not recognize any deferred affiliate revenue in the fourth quarter. Adjusted for the timing of deferred revenue at ESPN, domestic cable affiliate revenue was up mid-single digits in Q3. We expect domestic cable affiliate revenue to return to high-single digit growth in the fourth quarter and expect high-single digit growth for the full fiscal year. We also remain confident in our ability to drive high-single digit growth in domestic cable affiliate revenue through 2016 as we discussed at our recent ESPN Investor Day. Ad revenue at ESPN was up 10% in the quarter due to the strength of the World Cup, partially offset by lower ad revenue for the NBA finals as the series went five games this year compared to seven games last year. Adjusting for the World Cup and the absence of games six and seven of the NBA finals, ESPN ad revenue was up an estimated 5%. So far this quarter ESPN ad sales are pacing up. At parks and resorts, total revenue was up 8% and operating income was up 23% due to continued strength at our domestic operations partially offset by lower performance at our international resorts. The results this quarter include the benefit of one week of the Easter holiday compared to third quarter last year. Adjusted for the timing of the Easter holiday, operating income would have been up an estimated 17%. Growth in operating income at our domestic operations was driven by increased guest spending, higher attendance at our parks and higher ticket prices at Disney Cruise Line, partially offset by higher cost primarily related to the continued rollout of My Magic+. Operating income at our international operations was lower in the quarter as a result of lower performance at Disneyland Paris. Total segment margins were up 260 basis points in the third quarter and were adversely impacted by about 60 basis points due to new initiatives. We continue to see positive trends in the business with third quarter for capital spending in our domestic parks up 8% on higher ticket prices, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 3%. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 7% and occupancy was up 3 percentage points to 82%. So far this quarter domestic resorts reservations are pacing up 5% compared to prior year levels, while book rates are up 3%. At consumer products, growth in operating income in the quarter was led by our retail business and merchandize licensing. Disney stores continue to be a positive story with double digit growth in comp store sales in North America, Europe and Japan. Growth in licensing was driven by the performance of Frozen, Disney Channel, Spider Man and Planes properties, partially offset by lower revenues from Monsters. On a comparable basis earned licensing revenue in the third quarter was up an impressive 13% versus last year and that\u2019s following 8% growth in earned revenues in Q2. We are very happy with the performance of this business as it continues to consistently deliver strong results quarter-after-quarter. Results at Interactive Media continue to improve. We had yet another profitable quarter swinging from an operating loss of almost $60 million in the third quarter last year to almost $30 million in operating income in the third quarter. We saw improvement in our core games business, due primarily to the success of Disney Infinity, which was released in the fourth quarter last year and in addition this quarter we also saw a nice uplift from our mobile games business. During Q3, we repurchased 22.8 million shares for about $1.8 billion. Fiscal year-to-date we have repurchased 74.3 million shares for $5.6 billion. And with that we are now ready to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The first question is from Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America.\nJessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America: I have two questions. You have always been able to drive your franchises throughout the organization and I was just wondering when you see something like Harry Potter becoming a game changer for Universal, is there a franchise for you that can do -- not that you need to have a game changer, but is there something that can drive that kind of a lift? Maybe that's what you were referring to, Bob. And then, I have a second question.\nJay Rasulo: I think we have a lot of them. Cars Land is a great example of it, or Cars. Clearly, Disney Princesses is a franchise that are all over our parks globally. Star Wars is going to be just that. We have global licensing rights to Avatar. I could go on, Pixar -- there is plenty of Monsters presence. There\u2019s a Toy Story attraction in every one of our parks around the work. I think there are literally dozens of them. We have more than anyone and unlike competitors in the marketplace, except where a couple -- Avatar been probably now the only example, we don\u2019t have to license from third parties, we own them all.\nJessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America: Right. I meant -- maybe that's why you mentioned Star Wars. There was something with Star Wars. But -- and then the other question is also park related. With MyMagic+, can you talk about any -- you have anniversaried the costs. Is there a longer-term benefit in terms of a revenue component?\nBob Iger: There is and we\u2019ve said that it\u2019s going to contribute to our growth in the next quarter. This is actually -- it's a quarter that we just announced as the first full quarter was basically fully operational and we were available to all guests, both those that come as basically walk-up guests to our parks but also or single day ticket holders and those that reserve in advance. And the plan all along was that for it to enable us to grow revenue, clearly that happens in a variety of ways. It's increasing guest satisfaction. So that should have an impact on essentially length of stay, repeat visitation word of mouth. There are other opportunities from a direct revenue generating perspective that I won\u2019t get into in great detail but we\u2019d be glad detail at a later day. But PhotoPass is one specific example of that, but there are many more and this going to start delivering basically a positive impact to the bottom-line in the quarter that we\u2019re just in, that we\u2019re now in.\nOperator: Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson: I have two, one for Jay and one for Bob. Jay, firstly, when you look at your domestic parks, it looks like over the past couple quarters or years, you have been getting low single-digit attendance growth and good mid-single-digit per cap spending growth. And I wonder when you look out the next couple years and given your history in parks, do you think that's kind of the right way to think about the drivers to the revenue model there?\nJay Rasulo: Well, Michael we\u2019ve seen, if you look at the last five years, we\u2019ve really seen incredibly strong results from the addition of attractions, lands and experiences based on franchises that have been incredibly powerful. A few minutes ago Bob just mentioned Cars and before that Toy Story and we know that these are the kinds of attractions that pull people from, gee, I\u2019m going to go to a Disney Park someday do I want to go this year. If you look forward, whether it\u2019s Avatar and we've spoken with the opportunity for Star Wars in our parks, these are the kinds of things that have been absolutely of the basis of our growth here in the U.S. and if you look overseas, like in Hong Kong for instance you\u2019ll see Iron Man being introduced into that park soon. So, I think that from a volume perspective, we remain keenly focused on enhancing the experience, having guests who come to Central Florida or Southern California, extend their stay with us and that has served us for 30-40 years as a strategy and I don\u2019t see any reason why we won\u2019t continue that. In terms of the other side you mentioned, on per cast, Bob just mentioned that we expect MyMagic+ to have some revenue impact as it continues to be fully utilized by guests. We also have been able to continue to price behind the value of our offering. So I also see that as a continuing trend. So we don\u2019t like to get out and predict what\u2019s going to happen tomorrow but the fundamental strategies that have delivered those results you mentioned are still in place and are still serving us well.\nMichael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson: Okay, and thanks Jay. And then to Bob, over the years you\u2019ve been pretty straight forward about challenges you see at different businesses that you guys are in. I wondered given the past upfront, when volumes were pretty weak for broadcasting cable, whether or not you see that as a sign of change in the TV end model, or is it just something else? I wanted to get your opinion on what happened in the past upfront.\nBob Iger: Well, I think that you are definitely seeing more compelling growth in advertising spending on new media platforms, digital platforms than you are on the traditional. I don\u2019t think though that it\u2019s matched dollar for dollar in the sense that I don\u2019t think all the money that\u2019s flowed away from broadcasting in the upfront necessarily flowed directly into new digital platforms, even though I believe that these platforms have siphoned off some money from the traditional broadcasters. I think some of the money just wasn\u2019t expressed because advertisers are choosing to essentially commit the spending much closer to the time that the spots actually run. So I think you\u2019re going to see some of the money that wasn\u2019t in the upfront expressed in scatter and some of it clearly move to new platforms. That said ESPN had an extremely good upfront. It happened late so it basically just ended but there the numbers were very compelling in that you had absolute increased volume of spending over last year. So not just increased rates or increased units sold but increased dollars committed to ESPN in the upfront. Now that may speak volumes about live programming and about the nature of the live programming that ESPN has, but I think you are definitely seeing a shift. We\u2019ve made a conscious decision as a Company to essentially not be as reliant on advertising as we were in the past. So it represents probably somewhere in the neighborhood of the low-20% range of our total revenue. That\u2019s pretty purposeful because we see a much more competitive environment out there for advertising. We intend to participate in that environment in the sense that by moving product into new digital platforms, we fully expect to gain revenue on the digital advertising front, but I think you\u2019re going to see basically continued pressure on traditional advertising platforms. We\u2019re certainly seeing it a lot, not we as a company but you\u2019re seeing it in the business in print and in radio and probably in outdoor, and I think that\u2019s pretty telling. Television, a little less susceptible to that because there as an advertiser we can say it\u2019s still a very, very effective way of advertising a product. But definitely the world is changing.\nOperator: Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani - JPMorgan: You\u2019ve done such a great job improving profitability at the parks. I guess can that continue? How should we think about profitability longer term, at least domestically?\nBob Iger: We have been steadily adding to our margins in our domestic operations, you are absolutely right about that Alexia. And we have said that the ramp up of all the new initiatives that we\u2019ve launched over the last three to five years have been a drag on those margins. Those, as they continue to become fully operational and now start contributing as we always thought they would to the profitability of the parks, you are seeing quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year growth in our margins and I think that you will continue to see that. Now remember, as I answer to Michael\u2019s question the introduction of new product, the new initiatives is part of our fundamental strategy. It does have short-term impacts on margins, but positive long term impacts on value. So you may see -- it\u2019s not straight line upward as we introduced major new products but the fundamental operation of that business has been strong and of course volume and pricing increases help that and support it. The other thing I will add is and this goes back to the question that Jessica asked is as we spend money at the parks and new attractions that are based on known intellectual property and brands, the likelihood of their success is greater. So when we put -- when we increase Toy Story\u2019s presence or other Pixar presence, when we put Frozen in the parks, when we grow Star Wars\u2019 presence, which we will do significantly and we do it with Princess for instance, you are going to see I think basically better bets being made that pay off and that are more likely to pay off for us than some of the bets that were made in the past. Again it\u2019s just a question of essentially leveraging the great collection of franchises in IP that the company has in ways of a better returns on capital expenditures at the parks than we saw in the past.\nAlexia Quadrani - JPMorgan: And just a follow-up, if I may. Just given your success with Marvel and you have very high optimism for Lucasfilms, I guess combined with a growing value for content these days, have your priorities shifted at all when you are thinking about use of cash? I mean, are you more focused, I guess now than before on M&A?\nBob Iger: No. We made those three big bets in Pixar, Marvel, and Lucas two of them clearly are paid off handsomely and one we are pretty certain will, Lucas. We\u2019ve had a blend as you know in terms of how we\u2019re allocating capital or cash, between acquisition organic growth. Disney Juniors is a good example of that for instance. The Disney Channel worldwide another example and of course our continued increase in dividend and our buyback program which Jay addressed. I don\u2019t necessarily see that shifting that much. We\u2019ve said that we\u2019re not targeting any acquisitions that we over the size of the three that we brought and I don\u2019t want to speculate or whether that could change or not, but we feel right now that we\u2019ve got a great hand as a Company and we\u2019re spending a fair amount of time and capital investing in the assets that we currently have.\nOperator: We have Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nTodd Juenger - Sanford Bernstein: Two, I will keep them quick. Jay, bunch of releases recently on the SEC Network. Can you just update us on where you hope that will stand in terms of distribution at launch? Were there other rights or services often attached to those new agreements as they were signed, and any indication on sort of the financial impact that we should be thinking about? Thanks.\nJay Rasulo: We are incredibly happy the SEC Network launch best channel launch in history I think. We are now reaching as of the deals we\u2019ve done about 80 million American households and we suspect that that will and translate into about 60 million subscribers that will on August 14 start watching great programming on the SEC. I don\u2019t want to get into and I won\u2019t get into the details of the financial arrangements and results, but we are very bullish on this.\nTodd Juenger - Sanford Bernstein: All right, fair enough. And the one quick follow-up. Bob, wanted to just hear your thoughts on how big an opportunity you think international pay television is for Disney, and if you have any ambitions to get bigger there, either through organic or even M&A efforts? Thanks.\nBob Iger: Well, I think growth in international paid television is for good for us because of the great content that we have and the content that we have is fairly universal in appeal. So as entities grow their presence in pay television worldwide, our content is sought after more and we\u2019re monetizing that well. The Marvell TV product that we recently announced is a great example of that. For instance everything that's Disney branded. In terms of us getting involved directly, we have said for a while that we are going to launch product in marketplaces around the world that's going to enable us to sell some of our product direct to consumer. I don\u2019t want to get too specific about that but those opportunities to sell directly to consumer and that would be Movies, TV and probably other Disney products will be international and domestic in terms of opportunity.\nTodd Juenger - Sanford Bernstein: We have David Bank with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDavid Bank - RBC Capital Markets: .I feel like I asked this question the every other quarter when you have just a blowout studio performance here, but I will take another crack at it. If you kind of look back four or five years ago, the expectation for the studio was kind of a run rate of like $600 million, $700 million of EBIT and beginning with the first Avengers movie and that just rollout of this staggering pipeline of intellectual property related to Marvel on top of Pixar, and now Lucas, it sort of looks like you are in a -- unless something goes just incredibly wrong, there's just been a massive step function up in the earnings power of the studio that looks to me like a run rate at kind of, 11, 12 in EBIT. Can you talk about what your expectations are, given the incredible visibility in the pipeline for just, kind of, like profit generation for the studio for the next couple years?\nBob Iger: Well, I can agree with most of what you said but I will not give you specifics in terms of a predicted run rate because we just don\u2019t do that. But given the pipeline, that includes basically the brands and the franchises you mentioned, the slates not just for '15 but beyond are incredibly rich with tentpole movies that are branded, known that should work worldwide. And obviously releasing a Star Wars film every year starting in '15, what we said about Marvel with Avengers and Iron Man and Captain America 3 and a sequel to Guardians and plenty others, the obvious Disney animation success, which is now three pictures in a now and growing because I think that the one we\u2019ve got this Christmas Big Hero 6, will also be strong and then a very rich Pixar slate coming up, you\u2019re going to see some great results from the studio on top of the fact that we feel very well positioned, both in terms of our slate and our talent on the Disney live action front. Maleficent has done well over $700 million worldwide. If you look at the slate coming up from Tomorrowland and Cinderella and a number of other films, we think that group is operating at a top level and we're very bullish about their prospects too. So we think we are well positioned for this studio to be a significant driver of bottom line results for the Company certainly through the next five years. And I'm not sure I know what\u2019s out there that could disrupt us except for wide scale creative failure, and I certainly don\u2019t expect that.\nOperator:  We have Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley:  Bob in light of the Fox Time Warner news which is obviously dynamic as we speak, presumably one of the ideas there is that having significant scale in the domestic PayTV business and having size and affiliate fees has value. And I'm wondering give Disney\u2019s position with ESPN and ABC and Disney Channel, where you already have scale, do you view adding even more scale as helpful and creating value for the Company, adding more cable networks to portfolio or maybe conversely there starts to be some dis-synergy from size that you become sort of -- there's too many analysis so to speak so. I'd love to get your color on that since it\u2019s obviously pretty topical?\nBob Iger:  Well we like the hand that we have and we believe that we can continue to mine growth from the channel properties that we own, in Disney, in ESPN obviously and ABC and our 50% ownership of A&E Lifetime Networks, which is also very significant for us. We like that hand but we don\u2019t necessarily believe that we have to grow those businesses in order to prosper. We think we're positioned to continue to prosper in that business. I will say that in the multi-channel business, there is a lot of out there. There are a lot of channels and channels that have questionable brand propositions, channels whose ratings are not necessarily consistent, I'm not sure are going to be served as well over time. I don\u2019t think that marketplace continues to grow for all. I think the marketplace will continue to grow for those channels that are best branded, most in demand, best programmed, and I think we\u2019ve got those channels.\nBenjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: And if I could just ask a follow up to Jay on a different topic, on cable affiliate revenue growth, I guess same topic but on the quarter. Jay you mentioned that domestic affiliate revenue growth I think was up mid-singles in the quarter. I think it was high-singles last quarter. So any color on the deceleration and then acceleration into Q4? Is that basically the SEC network kicking in or is there anything additional you\u2019d want to add?\nJay Rasulo :  Thanks, Ben. I\u2019d be happy to try to shed some light on that. There are number of factors have led to this quarter affiliate revenue growth to be in mid rather than high single digits as it has been. First as you probably know, we haven\u2019t completed all of our deals with the multi-channel operators. Some are still operating under the old rate card and that is something that obviously we expect to change going forward. Secondly, we\u2019ve experienced some modest ESPN sub losses that we believe are mostly economically driven. We\u2019ve talked about this in the past. And finally the growth rate was impacted by some contractual adjustments during the quarter. But what\u2019s important to know as you said in your question is that we do expect to be back to delivering the high single digit domestic cable affiliate growth in Q4 that we\u2019ve been speaking of and also that the full fiscal year will be high single digits for fiscal \u201914. And as I said at the ESPN Investor Day, we still expect that, that will be high-single digit compounded annual growth in domestic cable affiliate revenue through 2016. We don\u2019t really breakout individual products like the SEC network. So I am not going to specifically speak about it.\nOperator:  Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Please go ahead. \nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura:  Just a question on your ongoing relationship with Netflix. It seems that Disney has been more aggressive than your peers in terms of deals with Netflix on the SVOD side, not only the PayOne deal that you have in U.S. but I think in the quarter you struck a similar deal with Netflix in Canada. Why have you guys been more aggressive than other media content companies? Do you think it\u2019s your genre -- the kids genre is more value add from SVOD as compared to sort of traditional premium PayTV or is it just that you are getting kind of pretty material pioneer tax from Netflix?\nBob Iger: Netflix, we\u2019re growing our business with Netflix, first of all because we believe in their platform and its future. And we have from the beginning, when we did the output deal with the studio and we also believe that our brands can be well monetized on their platform, which is evidenced what they are paying for our brands and our content. So as long as that continues, which I think it will, not just domestically but internationally our business is expected to be robust with them or even grow. So it\u2019s a good combination. We\u2019ve got brands and content that they want and they have a platform that we like and that we want and they are willing to pay the right price for our content, good prices for our content. I think it\u2019s mutually beneficial.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura: Okay. And then just maybe a follow-up, maybe I guess for Jay more specifically. As Netflix expands into new territories internationally, France and Germany coming up, you guys being natural partners with Netflix, should we expect that you will see a bump in digital revenue as Netflix turns on new countries? And should we expect to see that flow through the P&L?\nJay Rasulo : I\u2019m not going to put shadow what revenue we\u2019ll come off with Netflix in the future but everything that Bob says I believe applies to every market that Netflix would enter in the future.\nOperator: Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.\nJason Bazinet - Citi: Maybe this is a little bit of a strange question, but I think it was probably about a decade ago, Disney invested in MovieBeam. And I was just wondering, is there still an appetite on the part of Disney to have something that is more direct-to-consumer or was that just an experiment and strategically, sort of moved on?\nBob Iger: Well, definitely moved from MovieBeam itself. I barely remember it. I think it actually was a noble experiment, might have been slightly ahead of its time and little bit off pace in terms of the technology because it required an extra device in the home. I think actually this Company is very well positioned to offer product directly to the consumer. Right now, we do that primarily at parks and resorts. I think that we would in all likelihood grow our direct to consumer business in our media space and the movie space et cetera and so on, overtime and I think that will be an important strategy for the company in the future for all kinds of reasons, one being that I think that access to the consumer and it has all kinds of value. Secondly I think we can better serve the consumer with our, certainly our Disney branded product by going direct. That said we have good relationships with distributors, whether they are big-box retailers or theater operators or MVPDs for pay television or pay media platforms like Netflix. So I think you\u2019ll see overtime growth in Disney\u2019s direct to consumer business, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we\u2019ll get out of the third party distributor business. That would be impossibility.\nJason Bazinet - Citi: Understood. And can I just ask one unrelated question? Do think that there is any chance at all over the next few years to sort of clean up the A&E, ESPN sort of ownership structure?\nBob Iger: Well, you say cleaning up suggesting that there is something wrong with it. We have a great relationship for with Hearst, a great partnership with them that dates back decades and works extremely well for both companies. We like being partnered with them. They've been great, both in terms of investing for future growth and also sustaining and supporting the current business.\nOperator: Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\nMichael Morris - Guggenheim Securities: Two questions on ESPN. First, there is some growth in sports advertising inventory, whether it is launched at SEC Network, another night of NFL on broadcast this fall. I\u2019m curious what you are seeing in terms of growth on the demand side for the inventory. Is it -- are you seeing growth from your existing or traditional sports-focused advertising partners, or are you able to draw new partners into buying into sports programming? And then, second of all, I'm curious about the relationship between ESPN and the parks and they are both, obviously, huge businesses for you. The relationship between the two does seem relatively limited. Why is that? Is there an opportunity for expanding that relationship or are there some structural limitations to a partnership there? Thanks.\nBob Iger: The first question, we definitely have seen growth in terms of number of advertisers coming into the sports space. We\u2019ve also seen a lot of growth with advertisers who want to buy the sports space on a multi-platform basis. And in fact I think virtually a 100% of all ESPN sales were close to it. Certainly well, north of three quarters of their total sales are bought cross platform. So they are buying digital platform, the magazine, radio, the television channels et cetera. I think sports is definitely a growth area for advertisers. Obviously live means a lot, but there just seems to be growing interest in sports in general. I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019ve seen more competition for sports rights in the last probably five years, because it\u2019s just more appealing to advertisers. The second part of the question, there is limited presence of ESPN in the parks. We have the big branded sports space in Orlando. We've tried our hand at some ESPN zone in a few locations. There's one at Downtown Disney in Anaheim. We're kicking around some other ideas possibly for some other locations. But in general the experience people want when they enter our parks is more of, I call it a story telling experience, not necessarily a sports experience, even though there are lot of stories created and told in sports. The blend just doesn\u2019t seem to be that obvious, or the presence doesn\u2019t seem to be that obvious. So there is not much in development in terms of increasing ESPN\u2019s presence in parks and resorts.\nMichael Morris - Guggenheim Securities : And on the first question, are there any categories that seem to be coming in more on the sports side or is it pretty broad based, the incremental demand that you mentioned?\nBob Iger: I don\u2019t know any categories off the top of my head. I do know though that advertisers that traditionally look for a varied audience, not just men are coming in, which is interesting. So in other words advertisers that typically look for audiences that include women\u2019s components or young people components are buying more sports time. Maybe because the audience is more diverse.\nOperator: We have Alan Gould with Evercore. Please go ahead. \nAlan Gould - Evercore : Bob, I want to go back to David's question a second. My question is, can the film business get any better than this? I recognize that you have an adventure sequel next year and Star Wars a year after, but you are on track to have the highest profits any studio has ever had in a year. And it seems like -- every single film, it seems to be working? \nBob Iger: Well I can pretty much guarantee over time that every single film will not work. I\u2019ve been in the business long enough to know that. I can\u2019t tell you which one wont right now. But that\u2019s the business. I will say that we\u2019ve got a great team across the board from Marvel to Pixar, Disney Animation, Lucasfilm folks and Disney Live Action. It kind of starts with that team which all rose up under Alan Horn\u2019s leadership; really pleased with the team that we\u2019ve got in place. And when you combine that team with the quality of intellectual properties that the Company owns, you have a much greater likelihood of sustainable success, which is something that has been -- has alluded us in the past and I think in some respects has alluded many studios. We just have a -- we have a great hand of people and a great hand of intellectual property. \nAlan Gould - Evercore : But you even think there will be growth off of this level?\nBob Iger: I'm not predicting that there will be but I think given the slate, particularly when you consider the cadence of Star Wars films and the growth in Marvel and the addition of some Pixar films; look you\u2019re talking about a potential record year in 2014 that doesn\u2019t include a Pixar film, which is something that we pushed purposefully because the film that we were slated to release, we didn\u2019t feel was ready and we thought we were much better off seeking quality than rushing a product to marketplace which we'll continue to do. And so just the fact that we are doing as well as we're doing without a Pixar film probably says a lot of about what\u2019s up in the future, but we don\u2019t want to make specific predictions.\nOperator: David Miller with Topeka Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nDavid Miller - Topeka Capital Markets : Congratulations on the stellar results. Bob, what, if anything; can you tell us about the accident to Harrison Ford on the Star Wars set? There's just a lot of rumors flying around, or I guess there were maybe two or three weeks ago. Is it going to affect your release date? Are you still targeting the -- I believe its December 18, 2015, release date. And then related to that, and David Bank's question aside, it just seems like overall, over the last maybe two or three years that the studio is just a lot leaner? You guys have used technology in many wonderful and kind of creative ways to kind of lift operating income, it\u2019s not just about film performance, it's about use of technology. Do you agree with that and is there other stuff there left to do? As you go to bed at night, do you think about other things that you can do technologically to uplift that margin within the studio? Thanks a lot. \nBob Iger: Second part of your question, the studio is definitely running more efficiently for a variety of reasons, one being something that has nothing to do with technology. They\u2019ve reduced their development costs significantly. Meaning basically the overall deals they have with certain talent, which I think over time, didn\u2019t prove to be as valuable as they would have liked. And so if you look at the commitments long-term, we have these commitments to great intellectual property but we\u2019ve reduced our development costs. In addition to that, the studio has found all kinds of efficiencies, some the result of technology, some the result of just better or strong leadership. And I believe the question about as I go to bed at night, the one area that I think that there's still potential for efficiency, which is somewhat technology driven is in the marketing area and now there has been some things written recently about studio marketing costs. I think in today\u2019s world the opportunities that studios have to reach people with marketing messages on new technology platforms, obviously have grown significantly and I think with that should come some more efficiency and I know where our studio was looking at accomplishing that. In terms of the first question, we\u2019re not going to get into any details about Harrison Ford\u2019s accident and except to say that we are on track to premier the film on December 18, 2015.\nOperator: \n. : \nVasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee : I have a couple. You mentioned that you now have three $1 billion franchise properties in consumer products revenue. I think I know two of them, Princess and Star Wars. Do you mind telling me what the third one is? \nBob Iger:  The third one is followed by five others and we have eight. Pooh, Mickey Mouse, Monsters, Star Wars, Spider Man, Cars, Disney Junior and Princess.\nVasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee : And then, Jay I have a\u2026\nBob Iger: And all over $1 billion in global retail sales in fiscal 2014.\nVasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee : And Jay, I have a question about the income and the income and equity advantage deals for cable networks. It seems like it\u2019s getting a little bit more volatile in terms of year-on-year change recently and I think you are highlighting elevated spending at A&E. Can you please tell us what the -- is $230 million to $250 million a quarter a good run rate to think about it? What are the puts and takes going forward there?\nJay Rasulo: Well, I think we\u2019ve shared with you that, it was our expectation that with some of the product investment that we were doing, that we were in the back half of the year that we expected A&E\u2019s results which is by far and away the largest driver of that number, would have a back half of the year that would be flat or lower than it had been before. So it really does have to do with the constant building and rebuilding that\u2019s going on at the A&E Network. We\u2019ve got channels there and the leadership has done extremely well with them but want to continue with that success and of course and that involves investing in new programming as it does with any successful cable or network channel and that\u2019s really what you're seeing in those numbers, nothing beyond that.\nVasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee : So if I understand it correctly, we should see a slight decline in Q4 too year-on-year. Is that correct?\nJay Rasulo: Q4 is looking flattish and I think we said we are looking for flat numbers for the second half of the year.\nOperator: We have Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMarci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo : You were asked a little bit about increasing your scale domestically, and then global pay TV penetration, but do you feel any need to gain global scale in cable networks through M&A? That's the first question. And then, we have been hearing some of the weakness in national advertising pretty much across the board might have been some sort of displacement due to the World Cup, and since you had the World Cup, I'm just curious if you saw some advertisers really move money out of the traditional marketplace into the World Cup?\nBob Iger: We don\u2019t really believe that we need to gain any additional scale in terms of global channels. Our primary basic channel play worldwide is the Disney Channel or the Disney branded channels that includes Junior and XD. We continue to invest in growing that portfolio of channels, now well over a 100. We'll continue to do that. We\u2019re not necessarily looking to acquire more from more scale. With these brands and the content opportunities that we have to mine them, there are plenty of places for us to bring our product beyond just an owned channel, as we\u2019ve talked about on this call with the various growth in pay television for instance across the globe. The second question was World Cup advertising. I honestly -- now one has cited to us internally the fact that the World Cup may have taken advertising away from the more traditional broadcast channels. I think what you saw is one, some money migrating to new digital platforms and two, money not being expressed and the upfront being held back for scatter and essentially beginning to express near term to when the spots would run.\nLowell Singer:\n. : Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the results expressed or implied in light of a variety of factors, including factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Singer, you may begin.\nLowell Singer: Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's second quarter 2014 earnings call. Our press release was issued almost 45 minutes ago. It's available on our Web site at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and the website and a transcript will be available on our Web site. Joining me in Burbank for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob will lead off followed by Jay and then of course we will be happy to take some questions. So, with that, let me turn the call over to Bob and we will get started.\nBob Iger: Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. We're extremely pleased with our performance in Q2, with revenues up 10%, net income up 27%, and adjusted EPS up 41% to $1.11, the highest in the history of our Company. Once again, all of our business segments achieved double-digit increases or more in operating income. Our continued strong performance reflects the strength of our brands and the quality of our content. Our extraordinary creative success and our unique ability to leverage it across the entire Company. The unprecedented global success of Disney Animation's phenomenal Frozen continues and it's now the world's highest grossing animated film of all time. The best-selling title ever released on Blu-ray and digital. The demand for Frozen merchandise remains extremely high and the soundtrack was the number one album in the U.S. again last week. And as previously announced, Frozen is headed to Broadway. Captain America: The Winter Soldier has far surpassed the first Captain America in total global box office, which obviously bodes well for our Avengers franchise. We\u2019ve had enormous success releasing Marvel movies on the first weekend of May, including the two biggest domestic openings of all time. And we\u2019ll continue this tradition with the Avengers Age of Ultron next year and Captain America 3 in 2016. Avengers Age of Ultron is currently shooting an early footage and looks great. This August 1st, we\u2019re looking forward to introducing the world to more fantastic Marvel storytelling, with a great cast of new characters in Guardians of the Galaxy, which we screened last week and we believe it has strong franchise potential. Also on the Marvel front, we just announced the Disney Interactive\u2019s Infinity 2, will feature The Avengers, as well as other Marvel and Disney characters when it\u2019s released in the fall. Since the first version of the game launched last August, more than 3 million Disney Infinity starter packs have been sold and it was the best-selling interactive gaming toy of 2013 in the U.S. We made some news last week, when we announced the cast for Star Wars Episode VII, which includes some very familiar faces, as well as some exciting new talent. And the reaction has been tremendous. I was at Pinewood Studios with J. J. Abrams a couple of weeks ago, unlike more confident than ever that Episode VII will be the extraordinary movie Star Wars fans have been waiting for. Our Parks and Resorts had another record quarter and we have completed the rollout of MyMagic+ to all guests, which Jay will get into in a few minutes. Guest reaction has been very positive and we believe the new program is delivering nicely on its promise of improving guest experience. Internationally, Hong Kong Disneyland set new attendance and occupancy records in Q2 and construction on Shanghai Disney Resort continues to go well. There are an estimated 330 million potential guests within a three-hour travel radius of our Shanghai Resort, and by the time, we open the gates in late 2015, China\u2019s travel market is expected to be 34% bigger than it was in 2012. And the number of upper middle-class and affluent households is expected to grow by 18% a year for most of the next decade. These trends factored into our recent decision with our partners in Shanghai to accelerate expansion with an additional $800 million investment. Turning to Media Networks, both our cable and broadcast businesses had a solid quarter. We showcased the strength and long-term potential of ESPN at our Investor Day last month. It\u2019s an incredible brand that continues to drive tremendous value for us, and we've got a lot of reasons to be excited about what's coming up, including a great NBA post-season culminating with the finals on ABC, the World Cup from Brazil, a very promising Monday Night Football schedule, and ESPN's first foray into the NFL post-season. Finally, I would like to share a few thoughts about our acquisition of the top online video network Maker Studios. We are excited about entering the short form video space in a much more asserted manner to boost the presence of our brands and franchises in this increasingly valuable and fast growing arena. Maker's production talent and leadership will create exciting new opportunities to drive value from our content and create new content as well. By any measure, we had great success in Q2, creatively, financially and strategically. In addition to our unique ability to leverage content across the entire Company to create maximum value, our unparallel portfolio of incredibly strong brands is a clear strategic advantage that we expect will be evident in our results for years to come. And now, I'm going to turn this call over to Jay, so he can walk you through the details of our results in the second quarter. Jay?\nJay Rasulo: Thanks Bob and good afternoon everyone. We had a great first half of fiscal 2014. In fact, it's the best first half in the Company's history. Our second quarter results once again reflect the significant benefit we derived from our strategy of investing in high-quality content. As Bob mentioned, adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter were up 41% to $1.11. Each segment delivered meaningful increases in operating income and in the case of the Studio, operating income was up over 300% to $475 million, representing one of the Studio's best quarters ever. During the quarter, the growth in operating income at the Studio was due primarily to the domestic home video release of Frozen and the film's strong theatrical performance overseas, where it has generated approximately $770 million in international box office to-date. Higher operating income from television distribution also contributed to growth in the quarter. Media Networks delivered higher operating income in the second quarter due to growth at both cable and broadcasting. At cable, growth in operating income was driven by ESPN, domestic Disney Channels and higher equity income from our investment in A&E Television Networks. Growth in ESPN's operating income was due to higher affiliate revenue and lower programming and production costs, partially offset by lower ad revenue. ESPN continues to benefit in the quarter from the absence of losses at our ESPN UK business, which was sold in the fourth quarter last year. Programming cost with ESPN were lower than in the prior year as contractual rate increases for college basketball were more than offset by the absence of costs for UK sports rights. During the second quarter, ESPN deferred $80 million less in affiliate revenue than in Q2 of last year, due primarily to the signing of a new affiliate contract. As we look to the third quarter, we expect ESPN to recognize approximately $190 million less in previously deferred affiliate revenue compared to the prior year. I'll remind you these changes have no impact on full year results. Ad revenue at ESPN declined low single-digits in the second quarter due to a decrease in units sold and lower ratings, partially offset by higher rates. The marketplace was not particularly robust in the second quarter. So far this quarter ESPN ad sales are pacing up mid single-digits, driven by demand for the World Cup. The broadcast of those matches gets underway in late Q3 and runs through the first two weeks of Q4. Domestic cable affiliate revenue growth was up low double-digits in the quarter, which was aided by the timing of program covenants. Adjusted for the timing of deferred revenue at ESPN, growth in domestic cable affiliate revenue was up high single-digits. Broadcasting operating income was up in the quarter driven by higher affiliate revenue and lower expenses, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was down in the quarter due to lower ratings, partially offset by higher rates. Quarter-to-date, scatter pricing at the network is running mid-single digits above upfront levels. At Parks and Resorts, our Q2 results reflect strong underlying trends in the business. Total revenue was up 8% and operating income was up 19%, as a result of continued strength. Results at our international operations were comparable to the prior year, as growth at Hong Kong Disneyland was offset by a decline at Disneyland Paris. Total segment margins were up 120 basis points in the second quarter and were adversely impacted by about 200 basis points due to new initiatives. The second quarter also included one less week of the Easter holiday compared to last year. Adjusted for the timing of the Easter holiday, operating income would have been up an estimated 31%. Growth in operating income at on our domestic operations was driven by higher guest spending at Walt Disney World and higher attendance at Disneyland Resort, partially offset by higher costs, primarily related to the continued rollout of MyMagic+. We made MyMagic+ available to all on property guests during the first fiscal quarter and to all other guests at the beginning of the third quarter. We are pleased with some of the changes in guest behavior and park dynamics we are already seeing. Guest adoption of our MyMagic+ pre-visit planning tools is encouraging. Roughly three quarters of our Resort guests are using them to plan their visit. Just one month after making pre-arrival planning of FastPass+ available to our day guests more than 25% of them are pre-engaging with us. Historically guests who preplan spend more time at our Parks, so we like these early trends. MyMagic+ has also increased the engagement with FastPass+ by 40% relative to the legacy FASTPASS system, and allowed us to increase the number of guests we can accommodate during peak periods. Our research indicates that these benefits are driving higher overall levels of guest satisfaction. During the second quarter, per capita spending at our domestic Parks was up 4% on higher ticket prices, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Attendance at our domestic Parks was up 3% setting a second quarter attendance record. Per room spending in our domestic hotels was up 3% and occupancy was up 6 percentage points to 86%. So far this quarter, domestic Resort reservations are pacing up 3% compared to prior year levels, while book rates are up 6%. At Consumer Products, operating income increased 37% and margins were higher by almost 500 basis points, reflecting continued strength in our merchandise licensing business and retail. Growth in licensing was driven by higher revenue for Disney Channel, Mickey and Minnie, and Planes properties. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue in the second quarter was up 8% versus last year. That's three consecutive quarters of mid to high-single-digit growth in earned revenue, which is pretty impressive. Results at Disney Interactive were significantly better than we anticipated when we reported Q1 results due to the continued success of Disney Infinity. We had another profitable quarter, which makes it three consecutive quarters of profitability, a first for the segment. In addition to success of Disney Infinity, growth in our Japan mobile business also contributed to higher operating income albeit to a lesser extent. We continue to repurchase our stock during the second quarter and we are still on pace to repurchase between $6 billion and $8 billion for fiscal 2014. During Q2, we repurchased 19.9 million shares for about $1.5 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased 58.2 million shares for $4.3 billion. With that, we're now ready to take your questions.\nLowell Singer: Okay, thanks Jay. Eric, we are ready to open it up for questions.\nQuestion: \nand: \nOperator:  Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from Michael Nathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nathanson : Thanks. I have just one for Jay and Bob. Talking about Consumer Products for a second, you didn't call out Frozen in either the press release or the comments. So, can you talk about the impact Frozen will have this quarter on Consumer Products? Then if we think about it more broadly given the shortages of inventory, how big can Frozen be? Can you benchmark it to some other of your franchises, and when is the timing of Frozen in terms of hitting, if there's a catch-up trade on the inventory side? So let's start with that for a second.\n MoffettNathanson: Thanks. I have just one for Jay and Bob. Talking about Consumer Products for a second, you didn't call out Frozen in either the press release or the comments. So, can you talk about the impact Frozen will have this quarter on Consumer Products? Then if we think about it more broadly given the shortages of inventory, how big can Frozen be? Can you benchmark it to some other of your franchises, and when is the timing of Frozen in terms of hitting, if there's a catch-up trade on the inventory side? So let's start with that for a second.\nBob Iger: Hi Michael in terms of the impact of this quarter, Frozen, we saw that impact much more heavily at the Disney Store than we did broadly in the merchandize area. In fact, nine out of the 10 highest selling items at the Disney Store in the quarter were Frozen merchandise. So, it not only had great sales, but increased footfall at the store and at the stores, and they had a very, very strong result. Obviously, with the release of the DVD, I think you'll see the impact, the second part of your question, the impact on our license business with the impact we see in general, high periods like back-to-school and obviously Christmas in Q4, Q1 of next year you'll see the biggest impact. But, you know whether its music, whether it's interest in the DVD or general interest in this franchise, it will continue to be a driver we believe for some time into the future. It was not in our licensing business, obviously one of the top three franchises in terms of driving as you mentioned.\nMichael Nathanson :  Okay, and I just wondered, could Bob -- I know you spent time in the past sizing some of the franchises, how will this rank in terms of what you're thinking about compared to Princess and some of the other things you've done on the Investor Days' in the past -- so how big is this billion dollar franchise you think the next couple of years? \n MoffettNathanson:  Okay, and I just wondered, could Bob -- I know you spent time in the past sizing some of the franchises, how will this rank in terms of what you're thinking about compared to Princess and some of the other things you've done on the Investor Days' in the past -- so how big is this billion dollar franchise you think the next couple of years? \nBob Iger: This is definitely up there in terms of our top, probably five franchises. So you can expect us to take full advantage of that over the next or at least five years, I would guess. We're already taking a number of steps for instance to increase the character's presence in our Parks and developing some concepts around that. We're developing a Broadway show. We're talking about other forms of storytelling related to Frozen, whether it's publishing or interactive or the like. So I think this is going to be, given -- the passion for this film and these characters is so extraordinary, so well beyond what we ever even imagined that it would be hard to believe that it wouldn't sustain itself over a fairly long period of time. \nMichael Nathanson :  Okay thanks Bob. \n MoffettNathanson:  Okay thanks Bob. \nLowell Singer:  Thank you, Michael. Operator next question please. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani : Hi. Thank you. Just a question on the Parks, you've had such great success lately at the Parks and it looks like you have a few more tailwinds ahead going to the June quarter and beyond with a little bit of the benefits from late Easter, the earlier pricing at Disney World and then the opening, I think it was a final bit of the fans reservation -- renovation there. I guess, could give us any color of how we should think about, can that growth kind of continue? Then any color maybe on the cost side with the launch cost if there is anything significant to this last phase of the opening? Then I guess additional costs of MyMagic+ there is mostly behind us.\n JPMorgan: Hi. Thank you. Just a question on the Parks, you've had such great success lately at the Parks and it looks like you have a few more tailwinds ahead going to the June quarter and beyond with a little bit of the benefits from late Easter, the earlier pricing at Disney World and then the opening, I think it was a final bit of the fans reservation -- renovation there.

Then any color maybe on the cost side with the launch cost if there is anything significant to this last phase of the opening? Then I guess additional costs of MyMagic+ there is mostly behind us.\nBob Iger: Taking the back half of your question first Alexia, I don\u2019t think you should look for any extraordinary costs as we continue to market the opening of Fantasyland with the Mine Coaster. I would say that and we\u2019ve been saying that the only extraordinary cost which of course we expect to taper over time is our launch of MyMagic+, which in Q3 we launched to all day guests, in fact all guests now who visit Walt Disney World and we\u2019re still very much in the process of communicating its benefit, and I think guests are picking up on that very quickly. In terms of the business overall, you mentioned the one week of Easter that will give us about $45 million lift in Q3. And looking forward, it\u2019s very hard to look in a crystal ball, but we gave you to pacing on bookings and rates. You\u2019re right that we have the price increase earlier at Walt Disney World that will continue to help us year-over-year relative to when we took that price increase last year, and we don\u2019t have any crystal ball that we haven\u2019t revealed to you that I want talk about any further.\nAlexia Quadrani : Then just as a follow-up on the Parks. I don\u2019t know how much you can say on this front, but given you past experiences, is there any sort of general commentary you can give us and how we should think about the profitability ramp when Shanghai opens?\n JPMorgan: Then just as a follow-up on the Parks. I don\u2019t know how much you can say on this front, but given you past experiences, is there any sort of general commentary you can give us and how we should think about the profitability ramp when Shanghai opens?\nBob Iger: I don\u2019t think it's prudent to talk in advance of -- of an event that\u2019s over a year and a half away. I think that we are obviously very happy with the progress we're making in the construction of that project. We\u2019re very excited about the market trends that we see in terms of the general ability of the traveling and the increase in the ability of the traveling middle-class in China, the proximate population that we feel we can market to, but I don't want to make any predictions about what will happen post opening.\nAlexia Quadrani :  Okay thank you very much. \n JPMorgan:  Okay thank you very much. \nLowell Singer: \n.: \nOperator: And the next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Cohen : Thanks. The first one is for Bob. It's clear that this branded content strategy in the film division is unique, and obviously it's a huge success. So I was just hoping you could give us some color or your views on where you think you are on this strategy. As this fully rolls out, I know are you comfortable now, are you confident that Marvel is at a new higher level, I mean, it seems like each division is -- given just a few films is very focused, are really working and working throughout the organization. So I would love to get your views on kind of how far you are on that strategy. Then for Jay, you mentioned with the new FASTPASS, part of the MyMagic+ rollout, that capacity, that you can get more people in and out of the Parks, how much did capacity increase?\n Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks. The first one is for Bob. It's clear that this branded content strategy in the film division is unique, and obviously it's a huge success.

So I would love to get your views on kind of how far you are on that strategy. Then for Jay, you mentioned with the new FASTPASS, part of the MyMagic+ rollout, that capacity, that you can get more people in and out of the Parks, how much did capacity increase?\nBob Iger: I'm obviously biased, Jessica, but I think the strategy of making branded movies is definitely working and I think that we really are just seeing the beginnings of it in terms of their impact on the Company, particularly since we have a fair amount of visibility about the pipeline from all of these great brands. It's clear for instance that we've continued the great success at Pixar since that acquisition and that that acquisition has had a great impact on raising the quality level and the success of the films of Disney Animation, not just with Frozen, but Tangled before, and Wreck-It Ralph and films coming up. Marvel is, as far as we're concerned is just getting started. The results of Captain America, though I think are very, very telling, because when you look at the film that is approaching almost $700 million in global box office, I think $680 million, and you compare that to Captain America 1, which did under $400 million worldwide and even look at it versus Thor movies, a few of the Iron Man movies, you're looking at a film that has actually done substantially better than a lot of the Marvel films that we put out. Now, it was a great film, but it's clear that momentum is building for that franchise and with Avengers 2 in production and coming up and characters from Avengers still very much in favor with audiences, I think there is huge potential there. In addition to that, we've got a new film, Guardians of the Galaxy coming out August 1 in the United States this summer, which we've seen, I mentioned in my comments. We feel quite good about that too. That's a whole other Marvel realm or universe in terms of where it takes place, the characters that populate it and the stories that you can tell for those characters. So, I think, I'm not going to predict that we've got another, Avengers on our hands, but that's certainly the goal. Then of course, you layer into all of this, other Disney Live movie -- motion pictures like Maleficent coming up, Cinderella, which is in final stages of production, Tomorrowland and other film we feel quite good about. The pipeline is rich there and the brand is strong and then obviously I won't forget Star Wars. We would have to be the first to admit that even we're surprised that the fervor and the level of interest, the passion for this property, we knew that it was strong when we made the acquisition. But as we've gotten into it more, we've gotten closer to it. As the film essentially starts filming, it's just amazing to us just what kind of pent-up demand there is, and we feel great about where it is creatively. We feel good about the script, we feel great about the director, we feel really good about cast and we couldn't be more excited about it. As we've mentioned on the earlier calls, we intend to make these three of the Star Wars Sagas 7, 8 and 9 at a cadence this should be roughly every other year. Then we're in development on spinoff films, which we've not gotten specific about, but we feel that we've got at least three that we're targeting to go into production. So that pipeline is going to be rich, certainly through the end of this decade. Then lastly, I know I'm getting wordy, but when you look at the world today, we actually see growth in the motion picture business that is largely due to huge growth in international markets. China being probably the biggest one, the Chinese movie market has tripled in the last four years. As the number two market in the world, we think it's going to become the number one market by 2020 and our films are doing very well in those markets, Captain America the most recent example. So there is great opportunity, there is also a lot of competition globally and we think that when you've got these brands that are well known and in demand you are in a much better position competitively than you would be without them.\nJay Rasulo: In terms of your second question on FastPass+ and MyMagic+ in general. In my opening remarks, I talked about what's happening, I want to emphasize that whatever I say about both of these new products that we are in very, very early days and we have to sort of calibrate what our findings have been by the fact that we're only a few months in. But what we have found and, of course, capacity increases only really matter in our peak days and weeks. But because of FastPass+ the ability to basically plan your day as it relates the top attractions in the Park in advance. Has had huge pickup by our guests. It allows a better distribution of guests around the Park, and quite often the amount of capacity we can let into the Park is highly driven by pinch points, in particular areas of the Park that we don't want to get to overcrowded. So when guests are better distributed around the Park, we can often allow more in. I don\u2019t want to get into the specific numbers, it is in the thousands. But I don\u2019t want to get into the details about what that might ultimately mean financially. But we know that from a guest experience when you're down at Walt Disney World on peak days for Easter, Christmas, typically, some weeks in the summer, it is a huge enhancement in your experience when you can go to the Park you want to go to, on the day you want to and not fear that it\u2019s going to be closed out. So we see this is all great stuff. Again, very early in the process, but we\u2019re very, very encouraged across all the variables that we had hoped to achieve with MyMagic+ and FastPass+. \nJessica Reif Cohen : Thank you.\n Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: \n.: \nOperator: The next question comes from David Bank with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDavid Bank : Thanks very much. A question I guess on Maker Studios. Your successful acquisitions of scale I think historically certainly some Bob, you\u2019ve been running the Company have tended to focus on brands that you simply can't build right there. They had to be bought, they had incredible value, and most of them have turned out pretty successfully. So, how do you put Maker in that context, what couldn\u2019t you build -- what is the world-class brand that you\u2019ve acquired here and how does the Disney difference kind of make it a more powerful platform?\n RBC Capital Markets: Thanks very much. A question I guess on Maker Studios. Your successful acquisitions of scale I think historically certainly some Bob, you\u2019ve been running the Company have tended to focus on brands that you simply can't build right there. They had to be bought, they had incredible value, and most of them have turned out pretty successfully. So, how do you put Maker in that context, what couldn\u2019t you build -- what is the world-class brand that you\u2019ve acquired here and how does the Disney difference kind of make it a more powerful platform?\nBob Iger: Well, I think Maker has established itself as a bit of a brand and what is clearly a fast-growing space of short-form video online or on mobile platforms. But as we look at Maker, we see it first and foremost as a distribution platform and a very successful one, one that not only can command more eyeballs, more consumption, but with that more advertising revenue or revenue in general. We did not believe that we had the ability in the Company near term to distribute as effectively and to sell as effectively. We also thought they had an expertise from a production and a creative perspective on creating short-form video that we didn't think was as deep as it could've been at Disney. So we bought a lot of different capabilities, but mostly distribution. As we look at it, we believe that by creating access for the Maker people to some of our big brands and characters and storytelling, Star Wars would be a perfect example of that, Marvel, another one, that we can actually allow the Maker people to substantially improve the distribution or the reach of short-form video using these characters and stories, but also add their expertise on the production side. They also have great access to data and algorithms that you wouldn't have unless you had volume. It will take a long time to build the kind of technological expertise in that regard to essentially maximize the potential of a video online. They've got all that. So, we look at this as a great opportunity, both for Maker and for Disney, Maker using our IP, Disney using their expertise to distribute our product much more effectively. The other thing I want to add is, this is also potentially a great marketing opportunity for the Company. More and more, we're taking advantage of short form video and distribution for marketing messages for our movies, our theme Parks and our television shows. You can see the marketplace with a fair amount of it, but getting maximum traction from the distribution perspective takes a lot of expertise and a lot of experience and they've got that. So we think there is a huge marketing opportunity for this Company.\nDavid Bank : Can you give us any detail in terms of impact on the income statement, just as a quick follow-up?\n RBC Capital Markets: Can you give us any detail in terms of impact on the income statement, just as a quick follow-up?\nJay Rasulo: It will be dilutive, David, for a couple of years, a couple of cents.\nDavid Bank :  Thank you very much. \n RBC Capital Markets:  Thank you very much. \nJay Rasulo:  You are welcome. \nLowell Singer: \n.: \nOperator: The next question comes from Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Swinburne : Thanks. Jay, I just wanted to confirm that you're still expecting cable expense growth, I think in the high singles on programming this year, is that still the expectation, I know first half was quite a bit lower?\n Morgan Stanley: Thanks. Jay, I just wanted to confirm that you're still expecting cable expense growth, I think in the high singles on programming this year, is that still the expectation, I know first half was quite a bit lower?\nJay Rasulo: Yes. You know we've said from the outset and I said to many of you at the Investor Day that we always expected those programming cost to be back-loaded in the second half of the year. It is simply related to the calendar of sports right as they role in. I ticked a couple of them off. I guess I'll do it again, Major League Baseball being one, the new NFL contract, which kicks-in in Q4 of '14 and we've got the World Cup this year in the third and fourth quarters. Those are the biggest drivers. There is also some college football in there. Lastly as I had mentioned before the launch of the SEC Network, so that is what is driving the somewhat back-loaded nature of our increase in costs for the year.\nBenjamin Swinburne : And this might be a bit of a stretched time used together, Bob, but when you look at the bet you've made with Maker and the bet on online video and maybe the agreement you've made with DISH, which at least it seems it that allows them to move towards an online streaming bundle. It seems like the Company is taking a view that they want to be -- you want to have Disney present for the future of television or future of streaming. I'm wondering if you look at that as a hedge against pay-TV and what will be happening in pay-TV, do you view them as complementary? I know this is probably a 10-year view than a six-month view, but how are you looking at those decisions in the context of your business, which as you outlined a few weeks ago at ESPN, the Media Networks throw off a lot of cash flow for the Company and the pay-TV bundle drives that. So any color there would be helpful.\n Morgan Stanley: And this might be a bit of a stretched time used together, Bob, but when you look at the bet you've made with Maker and the bet on online video and maybe the agreement you've made with DISH, which at least it seems it that allows them to move towards an online streaming bundle.

So any color there would be helpful.\nBob Iger: Yes, I feel it as complementary. I mean, you're throwing a lot of different concepts into the mix there. Maker versus the -- Maker and the streaming video, it's possible through the new DISH deal. Now in the Maker front, we think short-form is a front tier opportunity for us, meaning huge growth in consumption. We'd like to take advantage of that growth by essentially generating more revenue and more consumption of our product, not just for marketing messages, I mentioned a few minutes ago. So we really believe in essentially growth in entertainment on new media platforms, short-form and long-form too. If you look at what we did with Disney Movies -- the DMA product, Disney Movies Anywhere that we launched recently is another example of that. We think that you're going to see continued growth of consumption of media, entertainment in particular on mobile platforms, smartphones and tablets. We feel we need to be present in that space. On the DISH side, I mean that\u2019s a completely different story. The bet that\u2019s being made there by us and by DISH is that that product has the ability to attract people who may not have already signed up for multichannel service and getting them to sign up for something instead of nothing, we believe would be a real value to us. There is I guess an example of something that is very complementary to you call the pay-TV model. The same is we\u2019ve been doing with the WATCH apps that we\u2019ve been pretty aggressive with, a complementary product to make the pay-TV model more attractive for subscribers. \nBenjamin Swinburne : Got it, thank you.\n Morgan Stanley: Got it, thank you.\nLowell Singer: \n.: \nOperator: The next question comes from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nTodd Juenger : Hi. Thank you. I got a question on ABC and then a follow-up on the Parks. For ABC, according our numbers it looks like primetime ratings were down, I don't know, maybe double-digits year-over-year, which by the way was not unique among broadcast networks, and yet you had total revenue that was flattish and profitability was up. So my question is, as you think about that business going forward, how you think about -- I\u2019m sure, your plan is not to continue to have ratings erosion of that degree, but how do you think about putting capital at risk pursuing higher audiences versus the reality perhaps that there might be some audience erosion that\u2019s inevitable and the new economic formula that might suggest to you focus more on profitability?\n Sanford Bernstein: Hi.

As we look at the year that they\u2019ve had. We look at first of all the C3 rating, 18 to 49 because that\u2019s the primary driver of revenue. Because the network -- ABC has very little sports, some of it provided by ESPN, but less than certainly some of the other networks. We tend to look at non-sports programming, as we see it -- we're down high single-digits in the C-3 18 to 49 number exports for this season, little bit more than that for the quarter that we just reported. The name of the game obviously is strengthening our programming, which is what ABC is just in the middle of with a lineup of pilots that have just been screened and decisions that are being made this week to populate the schedule for the fall is our hope that we will reverse the tide of some of that ratings erosion, it better shows on the air, quite frankly, and that's what the mission is. In addition to strengthening programming and raising ratings and hopefully revenues, the marketplace cooperates, the goal is also to own a substantial amount of that programming. And in today's world, that can create huge value for the owner of that property. As we've seen in many, many different cases, both with our programming and programming that is created by others, thanks to obviously many new entrants in the marketplace, Netflix and Hulu, among them. So we're still viewing this business as a profit generating business and a business that can generate a substantial or acceptable returns on invested capital for the Company.\nTodd Juenger : That's a perfect segue into the follow-up I wanted to ask on Parks. Jay, I don't know if you or Bob want to take this, but let me take another run at the Parks because return on invested capital is a metric that in the early days of latest cruise ships, is a metric you actually I think shared with us a couple times. If I recall correctly, you talked about ROICs in the mid to high teens for the new cruise ship operations. I would think that, at least for Disney California Adventure you'd have enough time now to have measured that. In fact, I'm quite sure you measured it. I wondered, if you'd share with us what you think the returns on that capital deployment have been? Then put that in the context, now the future to come openings including of course Shanghai and the new capital you decided to put on top of that and sort of what your hurdle rates and thoughts around ROIC in that is?\n Sanford Bernstein: That's a perfect segue into the follow-up I wanted to ask on Parks.

Then put that in the context, now the future to come openings including of course Shanghai and the new capital you decided to put on top of that and sort of what your hurdle rates and thoughts around ROIC in that is?\nJay Rasulo: You may remember, actually Todd I'm not sure you were following our Company then, but when we announced the expansion of Disney California Adventure, we said that we believe that the returns would be attractive i.e., above our cost of capital at that time. In fact, so far, and, of course, returns in the Parks business are based over the long-term, but so far we have been absolutely thrilled with the results of that investment that we put in place and to a large extent on some variables meeting and others exceeding our expectations for what that investment could bring. So we still are very, very bullish that the returns that you and we are both going to feel very good about those returns. Although, I'm sorry, I'm not going to share the explicit numbers with you, but when I say please, I certainly mean above our cost of capital. Similarly for Walt Disney World, the expansion there, we don't take on projects that we don't believe will exceed our hurdle rate and the signs are absolutely go forward great on Walt Disney World. Bob talked earlier about the world's interest in Frozen. That is very focused on Anna and Elsa. You remember that the expansion of Fantasyland was very focused around Princess meet and greets and we can only expect great things there. You've seen the numbers quarter-after-quarter at Walt Disney World, including the last quarter where we've been able to price behind these investments and still feel very strong about our volume going forward. So we feel very good about it, I wish I could be more forthcoming with the numbers, but as I say they will work themselves out or payback over time, all signals so far are very strong.\nTodd Juenger : If can just, thanks Jay, just a very quick follow-up, when you think about China, I think I understand your cost of capital philosophy, is there an extra hurdle rate sort of a risk factor that you throw in top there that makes your expected returns need to be higher, is that a fair statement? Any color you put on the way you think about it, it'd be great.\n Sanford Bernstein: If can just, thanks Jay, just a very quick follow-up, when you think about China, I think I understand your cost of capital philosophy, is there an extra hurdle rate sort of a risk factor that you throw in top there that makes your expected returns need to be higher, is that a fair statement? Any color you put on the way you think about it, it'd be great.\nJay Rasulo: Well, the China situation because it's a shared investment, is a little more complicated situation. First, we don't like to take on projects that are on a total ownership basis, don't have returns that we would like to see for our investors. But remember we have a much more limited investment and the flows are complicated between our partners and ourselves. So we also look at the return to Disney's investment in that. In both cases, we feel very good about it. We do risk adjust our hurdles rates in general. I don't want to get into the details of that, but I think you know that most companies based on relative inflation rates and other risk factors adjust international hurdle rates appropriately and we do as well.\nLowell Singer: \n.: \nOperator: The next question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Please go ahead.\nAnthony DiClemente : Hi. Thanks. A couple of questions. First, Jay, I think on ESPN on the last quarterly call you had said pacing was up. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that just the ad market has been soft, I mean, we've seen that in the other media companies earnings reports. I mean, how would you really explain the slowdown in the market since your comment. Does it seem like something temporary that happened towards the latter part of the quarter, or is it something that\u2019s perhaps a little bit more ongoing or permanent, be it budget shift to digital or anything any other call out in terms of the ad market more broadly. Then second question for Bob, just had a question about Shanghai in terms of your decision to accelerate the CapEx, should we think about that as more of an acceleration or an addition to the existing plan? Then just wondering if you can give us some more color on the updated cadence of CapEx for Shanghai as we get closer to the opening? I\u2019m just wondering if that acceleration or addition has any impact on potential capital returns in 2015. I know that you\u2019ve not given guidance on that, but would love to hear any incremental color given your decision on the $800 million?\n Nomura: Hi. Thanks. A couple of questions.

I\u2019m just wondering if that acceleration or addition has any impact on potential capital returns in 2015. I know that you\u2019ve not given guidance on that, but would love to hear any incremental color given your decision on the $800 million?\nJay Rasulo: Okay Anthony, let me take the first half of that, which was the ESPN ad sales. Obviously when we spoke to you all last quarter, we gave you what our pacings were, that was a fact. I think that what happened in the quarter -- there are couple of complicating factors that are not typical of any quarter for ESPN. First, you know, every four years we have the perturbation in the sports market of the Winter Olympics or the Summer Olympics in the other years, it's very hard to predict what the impact of that is going to be. We took a guess at it, the impact turned out to be a little more than we thought. We also -- when you're broadcasting live sports, the match ups and the cities involved in the matchups announce speak specifically about the NBA, have something to do with the ads, you sell behind them. Whether it's Los Angeles, New York, or Boston three very big markets for basketball are not involved in the NBA post-season. So they affect our ratings. We already mentioned that we thought the ad market was a little bit soft and look I don't think this is a permanent situation. We've seen it this quarter. I don't expect it to be a long-term phenomenon.\nBob Iger: The question about Shanghai and CapEx, we always anticipated expanding that Park. In fact, the property that we've allocated -- that's been allocated for the project provides ample opportunity for expansion. As I said last week or early this week and as we indicated earlier today, what we're doing year after basically seeing some rather dramatic changes in the marketplace that we believe were positive is that we're accelerating investment, the $800 million which is what we announced we were accelerating it by is obviously shared with our partners, the Shanghai government. So, its impact from a capital expense perspective is relatively modest for us. As is our hope that with this expansion, which increases capacity, that most of it will be available to us at opening, puts a little more pressure on us because we're essentially building something that is bigger, but that is certainly the goal. Then you can expect in success, which we have every reason to believe will occur that there will be continued investment in this Park because of the size of the property and the size of the market, most populous city in the most populous country in the world, which is we've said a few times, 330 million people that we believe are potential Park guests living within a 3.5 hour trip. It's pretty compelling circumstance or opportunity for us and our partners and probably will deserve an infusion of more capital investment because we think the returns are going to be rather significant for us from this project.\nAnthony DiClemente : Anything, you could tell from the buyback. Okay thanks.\n Nomura: Anything, you could tell from the buyback. Okay thanks.\nJay Rasulo: On your question on the CapEx. So I want to first of all what Bob just talked about, what you asked about, is really a '15 and '16 event. It won't affect our capital expenditures in '14. In fact previously, what I had told all of you was that, we expected our CapEx in '14 to be $1 billion higher than it was in '13, and when adjusted for the Shanghai partner\u2019s contribution, it would be $600 million higher. In fact, I want to update that, I think our CapEx in 2014 will actually be $800 million higher not $1 billion, and $400 million not $600 million on an adjusted basis after the contribution from Shanghai. And that simply has to do with the timing. Obviously when you put a big project in place, you have all kinds of planning and you map against how that money will be spent. It's slightly different, in fact it's slower. It's a little bit slower, which means that spending will be out in '15 and '16. \nLowell Singer: \n.: \nOperator: The next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citibank. Please go ahead.\nJason Bazinet : Just a question for Mr. Rasulo, I think in the past you mentioned that for the total outlays for Shanghai, you did come out of the investing activities and then you\u2019d see add back under the financing side for the portion that is not yours? Are we already seeing those add backs under the financing line of the cash flow statement?\n Citibank: Just a question for Mr. Rasulo, I think in the past you mentioned that for the total outlays for Shanghai, you did come out of the investing activities and then you\u2019d see add back under the financing side for the portion that is not yours? Are we already seeing those add backs under the financing line of the cash flow statement?\nJay Rasulo: Yes, we are Jason. Those are being added in. Look they\u2019re not day-for-day obviously. We extend the capital, there is a process by which our partner reimburses the share of the spending, but it is lockstep is not delayed.\nJason Bazinet : That\u2019s just under financing other in the numbers that you give us?\n Citibank: That\u2019s just under financing other in the numbers that you give us?\nJay Rasulo: That\u2019s correct, Jason. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: \n.: \nOperator: The next question comes from David Miller with Topeka Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDavid Miller : Yes hi guys, congratulations on the stellar results. Just another question on Shanghai. Bob or Jay, just correct me if I'm wrong, I remember maybe five years ago -- four years ago, five years ago or so when Hong Kong opened, the kind of the core criticism, if you will, against the Park at the time was that just that it was too small. Indeed I think crowds just sort of overwhelmed that property for the first six or nine months or so. Is the residue left over from that memory part of the reason why you guys accelerated this investment in Shanghai because you just want to be sure that it's not too small or what led to this specifically? Was there another market study done or another sort of demographic study done to make you determine that the eligible patrons as you alluded to, will get into the Park quicker? I mean, if you could just answer that, I'd appreciate it.\n Topeka Capital Markets: Yes hi guys, congratulations on the stellar results. Just another question on Shanghai. Bob or Jay, just correct me if I'm wrong, I remember maybe five years ago -- four years ago, five years ago or so when Hong Kong opened, the kind of the core criticism, if you will, against the Park at the time was that just that it was too small.

Was there another market study done or another sort of demographic study done to make you determine that the eligible patrons as you alluded to, will get into the Park quicker? I mean, if you could just answer that, I'd appreciate it.\nBob Iger: Well, we've learned a lot from Hong Kong. Actually the problem that we had was a good problem to have and that demand was greater than we had expected initially. This is a different circumstance in many respects, but it doesn't mean that some of the learnings that we glean from Hong Kong can't be applied, and we are doing that and we have every reason to believe we're going to continue to do that. So I guess that's a way of my saying that we have -- as we've looked at this market, since we made the decision to build, since we broke ground and we've seen further development, more development than we expected, we clearly are reacting to what we believe will be greater demand than we initially anticipated for the Park in its first -- a year of operation or its early years of operation. We want to make sure that we build enough capacity to meet that demand. There are other things we\u2019re going to Resort to, to manage expectations in terms of visitation. For instance, it\u2019s likely that when we go to the market selling tickets there will be tickets that are date specific tickets, so that we can manage in effect, traffic or visitation much more carefully than you would if you just sold tickets and didn\u2019t have a date, and had no idea when the people who bought the tickets were going to show up. So, we\u2019re going to apply a number of things that we've learned over the years both from Hong Kong and other Parks, in how we -- what we build, how much we build, and how we operate.\nDavid Miller : Okay thank you very much.\n Topeka Capital Markets: Okay thank you very much.\nLowell Singer: \n.: \nOperator: Okay. And the last question comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\nMichael Morris : Thank you. Good afternoon guys. One on the DISH personal subscription over-the-top service. What is -- how important is it to you that they reach the critical mass needed for that service to take off? And is it a situation where the ball is really in their court to go out and get partners? Is it something that you can actively support in some way and bring other content companies on board? Are you looking at a similar service with any of your other distribution partners? Then I have one on Parks.\n Guggenheim Securities: Thank you. Good afternoon guys.

Are you looking at a similar service with any of your other distribution partners? Then I have one on Parks.\nBob Iger: It\u2019s DISH\u2019s responsibility to get critical mass from a program perspective. I saw Charlie Ergen last week and he is doing just that. I\u2019m not going to give you an update on how he\u2019s doing, but it\u2019s their responsibility. We don\u2019t intend to participate in that pursuit at all. We\u2019d like to see this product rolled into the marketplace because we think it's a smart thing for us to do, something that we should certainly try is a critical, no, but it's certainly critical that it gets critical mass from a programmer\u2019s perspective in order to bring it to market. And the second part of your question...\nLowell Singer: Second part on DISH.\nMichael Morris :  Other distribution partners, whether you are...\n Guggenheim Securities:  Other distribution partners, whether you are...\nLowell Singer: Are you going to sell it to others? \nBob Iger: I'm sorry, yes, yes, yes. We're open to selling it to others, but we have not engaged in any of those discussions yet. \nMichael Morris : Then at Parks, Comcast is committed to investing in both the Park and the Resorts, the hotels down in Orlando. I'm curious what have you seen in the past when competitors have invested locally? Is it a drag or does it actually generate more traffic in the region? How does that usually shakeout? \n Guggenheim Securities: Then at Parks, Comcast is committed to investing in both the Park and the Resorts, the hotels down in Orlando. I'm curious what have you seen in the past when competitors have invested locally? Is it a drag or does it actually generate more traffic in the region? How does that usually shakeout? \nBob Iger: What we've typically seen is that it drives more traffic to the region. Basically business goes up in Orlando or Central Florida. So we don't necessarily view it as negative for us because it really drives more people to the area. We not only have great product, but we have new product too. Fantasyland is the most recent example of that. As you know, we're developing Avatar for that Park, looking at a variety of other things to add in Orlando, opening up a hotel. Four Seasons is opening up this summer, for instance. So there'd be plenty more that we'd put into the marketplace that will take advantage of any growth the marketplace has. \nMichael Morris : Great. Thank you. \n Guggenheim Securities: Great. Thank you. \nBob Iger: Okay, thanks Mike, and thanks again everyone for joining us today.

Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Singer, you may begin.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, operator. Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to the Walt Disney Company's first quarter 2014 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 45 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and the webcast and a transcript will also be available on our website. Joining me for today's call in Burbank are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob will lead off followed by Jay, and then of course we will be happy to take your questions. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob, and we'll get started.\nBob Iger: Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon. We had a very strong first quarter with earnings per share up 32% when adjusted for comparability and operating income, up double digits across all business segments. Our Parks and Resorts had a great quarter setting attendance records at Walt Disney World, Hong Kong Disneyland and Tokyo Disney Resort. The popularity of Disney Infinity drove Interactive's profitability for the second consecutive quarter. The demands for Frozen, Star Wars and Disney Junior merchandise added up to a great quarter for our Consumer Products division. Our Media Networks delivered 20% growth in operating income, led in part by higher affiliate and advertising revenues of EPSN. While all our operating units delivered solid results this part quarter, we are particularly pleased with the performance of our studio, driven by the enormous success of Disney Animation's Frozen, Marvel's Thor: The Dark World and Walt Disney Studio's Saving Mr. Banks and that's where I want to focus on today. As we have articulated in the past, our studio strategy is to essentially make three types of movies, big releases with broad appeal and franchise potential under the Disney, Marvel and Lucasfilm brands. Animation, which is the heart and soul of this company is stronger than ever under the Pixar and Disney brands, and lower budget original films that entertain audiences and enhance the Disney brand through exceptional storytelling. In today's global marketplace big franchise films play extremely well, particularly those with action or family appeal. In fact, of the world's top-20 highest grossing movies of all time, 19 are franchised drivers and almost half of those carried the Disney, Pixar, Marvel or Lucasfilm brand. With all the creative brands that are now part of our company as well as the thousands of characters and phenomenal storytelling behind them we believe we are uniquely positioned to maximize the ever-expanding global movie market. Our success with Marvel is a great example. There is no question, the phenomenal success in Avengers, strengthened the Avengers franchise and is now driving subsequent Avengers based character films to stronger box-office performance. Iron Man 3 topped $1.2 billion in global box-office, far exceeding the $632 million for Iron Man 2. Likewise, Thor: The Dark World, has delivered more than $635 million global box-office versus $450 million for the first Thor movie. We expect this trend to continue when Captain America: The Winter Soldier opens on April 4th, in the United States. Having seen it a few times already, I can tell you this sequel takes the Captain America story to an incredible new level and I think audiences are going to be more invested in this character than ever before. Because, all Marvel content and characters exist in connected universe, this movie also sets some critical events in motion that will lead directly into Avengers: Age of Ultron and some facets of the story in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, will also be reflected in upcoming episodes of Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC. In August, we will release Guardians of the Galaxy, introducing audiences to a new cast of great Marvel characters. As we announced last quarter, Star Wars: Episode VII premiers in December of 2015 and it looks to be one of the biggest movies we have ever released. Nothing I say here today could ever capture or convey the magnitude global anticipation for this movie, so I am just going to say the excitement is fully justified and leave it to that. We are also very pleased with the work being done at Walt Disney Studios, blending their own form of tempo films with lower budget great original films like Saving Mr. Banks. They do so much to enhance the Disney brand image and we are excited about our upcoming slate, including Muppets Most Wanted, Angelina Jolie as Maleficent, Jon Hamm in Million Dollar Arm, George Clooney in Tomorrowland, which is directed by Brad Bird, and Disney's first even live action Cinderella. Lastly, animation is one of our biggest priorities, because it's one of our most important creative businesses. With Pixar and the created resurgence of Disney Animation, we now have the two strongest animations brands generating some of the greatest creative work in the industry, with Frozen being the most recent example. Frozen has now surpassed The Lion King to become the most successful Disney Animation movie of all time. It exceeded $870 million in global box-office before even being released in two of our most important markets. It just opened in China in the last 24 hours and it will open in Japan on March 15th. Frozen is not only a tremendous financial success, it's also an incredible creative trial earning the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, as well as Oscar nominations for Best Animated Film and Best Song. It has also just picked up 5 Emmy Awards for Outstanding Achievement in Animation. Two months after opening, Frozen is still big in theaters. It was second in U.S. box-office just this past weekend. Additionally, the sound track is at the top of the charts and high demand for Frozen merchandise continues to drive strong retail sales. With tradition of The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast, Disney's Frozen will also be going to Broadway. When we acquired Pixar in 2006, our goal was to not only support and benefit from the continued creative and commercial success of Pixar, but to rejuvenate Disney Animation under the leadership. Accomplishing this was not only a priority, but something that is and will continue to drive value across the company for years to come. We congratulate all those involved with Frozen and success speaks volumes, about the future of animation at our company. We are obviously proud of our performance this quarter and it's very satisfying to see long-term strategies come to fruition delivering results and driving greater value for our company and shareholders. I am going to turn the call over to Jay to talk about the details of our quarter performance and be back for questions later on. Jay?\nJay Rasulo: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our first quarter results. Segment operating income was up 27% on revenue growth of 9%. The strong financial performance was broad-based as each segment posted double-digit growth in operating income and margin expansion compared to prior year. I think, once again this quarter demonstrates that our investment strategy continues to create value. Media Networks delivered another great quarter of financial performance led by cable networks, which generated an impressive 34% increase in operating income driven by growth at ESPN and higher equity income. This more than offset a decline in operating income at broadcasting. Growth in ESPN's operating income was due to higher affiliate and advertising revenue. ESPN also benefited in the quarter from the absence of losses at our ESPN U.K. business, which was sold in the fourth quarter last year. Programming costs at ESPN were comparable to prior year as contractual increases for the NFL and college football were offset by the absence of costs for U.K. sports rights. During the first quarter, ESPN deferred $18 million less in affiliate revenue than last year. As we look to the second quarter, we expect ESPN to differ approximately $75 million less in affiliate revenue than last year. Ad revenue, ESPN's was up 10% in the first quarter due to higher rates and an increase in units sold, partially offset by lower ratings. So far this quarter, ESPN ad sales are pacing up slightly despite the impact of the Winter Olympics. Over last couple of years, we have provided insight into our cable affiliate revenue growth on an aggregate basis. Given some of the recent business model changes internationally, and the impact of foreign exchange rates, we think it might be more helpful to breakout the domestic affiliate growth as it constitutes the majority of our affiliate revenue. As such, our domestic cable affiliate revenue growth was up high single-digits in the quarter. Adjust for the timing of deferred revenue at ESPN, growth in domestic cable affiliate revenue was still up high single-digits. It's also important to note that the growth in Q1 reflected the last quarter in which year-over-year comparisons were aided by the new affiliate deals that took effect in the second fiscal quarter of 2013. Equity income was up in the quarter due to higher income from our investment in A&E Television Networks, as well as the absence of equity losses from our investment in the ESPN STAR Sports joint venture, which we sold in the prior year. At Broadcasting\\ lower operating income was driven by higher programming expenses at the ABC Network, due to write-offs as well as the contractual rate increase for Modern Family. Program sales in the quarter were down compared to last year when we sold Revenge and Army Wives. Ad revenue at the Network was up low-single digits in the quarter as a result of higher rates and increased units sold, partially offset by lower ratings. Quarter-to-date scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running more than 10% above upfront levels. At Parks and Resorts growth in operating income was once again, due to strength at our domestic operations, as investments at Walt Disney World and the Disneyland Resort continued to pay off. Results at our international operations were up modestly over the prior year, with growth in Hong Kong Disneyland partially offset by a decline at Disneyland Paris. Total segment margins were up 170 basis points in the first quarter. Growth in operating income at our domestic operations was driven by higher guest spending at Walt Disney World and the Disneyland Resort, partially offset by higher costs primarily related to the continued rollout of MyMagic+. For the quarter, per capita spending in the Parks was up 8% on higher ticket prices and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our hotels was up 5%. Attendance at our domestic Parks and occupancy at the hotels were comparable to first quarter last year, in which we saw increased visitation due to the opening of Cars Land at Disney California Adventure and with the grand opening of Fantasyland expansion at Walt Disney World, the last phase of which will complete in a few months with the launch of Seven Dwarfs Mine Train. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 7% compared to prior year levels while booked rates are up 2%. As Bob said, Studio Entertainment had a great quarter as a result of the global box-office success of both, Frozen and Thor: The Dark World, compared to Wreck-It Ralph and no Marvel title in the first quarter, last year. Studio operating income was up 75%, driven by increases in our theatrical business and to a lesser extent an increase in home entertainment due to lower distribution and marketing costs partially offset by lower unit sales. Our Consumer Products' operating income increased 24% and margins were higher by 400 basis points, reflecting strength in our Merchandise Licensing business and continued improvement at Retail. Growth in licensing was driven by the inclusion of Lucasfilm's results, as well as higher revenue from Planes, Disney Junior properties and Monsters. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue for the first quarter was up 5% versus last year and that follows the 9% growth in earned revenue in the fourth quarter. We continue to be pleased with the results of our Retail business, specifically in North America where comp store sales were up due to strong sales of Frozen and Disney Junior merchandise, demonstrating the power of our franchises to drive our Retail businesses as well as the Disney Store's ability to support company franchise. The North American stores have now posted comp store sales growth for eight consecutive quarters. At Interactive, we had another profitable quarter driven primarily by significant improvement in core gains, and to a lesser extent, continued growth in our Japan mobile business. Higher operating income in core gains was due to strong sales of Disney Infinity, compared to the Epic Mickey 2 last year. As we look at the second quarter, I want to point out that the Easter holiday will fall entirely in Q3 this year, whereas one week of the two-week holiday period fell in Q2 last year. We estimate the impact of this one week shift on Parks results to be roughly $45 million in operating income, shifting out of Q2 into Q3. At Interactive, we expect quarterly results to be somewhat lumpy throughout the year and they will largely follow the timing of key game releases. While the segment posted an operating profit in Q1, we expect an operating loss in the second quarter that's comparable to the loss in Q2 last year. We significantly increased our pace of share repurchase during the first quarter by buying back 25.3 million shares for about $1.7 billion. Fiscal year to-date, we have repurchased 33.7 million shares for $2.3 billion. Overall, we feel great about the start of the fiscal year. Our financial position is strong, and given recent and ongoing investments, we remain confident in our ability to drive growth and thus create value for our shareholders. With that, we are now ready to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani - JPMorgan:  Thank you. Frozen seems to have had a really incredible staying power at the box-office, still doing so well domestically many weeks after its initial release. Can you help us frame, I guess, both, the benefit we may see to the studio in the March quarter from these box-office results, but also home video release, I believe, in the middle of March, and maybe the longer-term benefits both, in film and maybe Consumer Products?\nBob Iger: Well, we won't give you specific numbers Alexia, but obviously the film's success continues in the quarter that we are currently in, although it was released as you know in November, Thanksgiving weekend, so the box-office is still growing, both domestically and internationally. We are second this past weekend with our sing-along. Internationally, it continues to grow. We just opened in China within the last 24 hours and we opened in Japan on March 15th. We had a mammoth opening and a great success in South Korea. It's actually the biggest animated film ever in South Korea, box-office, above $45 million, so we think that bodes well for both, the Asian markets that we are just opening or will open. It's continuing to drive sales in our stores and across licensing, so it will have an affect there. Clearly, we are having success on the music front, albeit small from a numbers perspective, and this has real franchise potential, so just beyond the quarter that we are in, expect to see not just with new product that we create from Frozen, but expect to see continued interest in this and continued impact on the bottom line for quite a while.\nAlexia Quadrani - JPMorgan:  Just a related follow-up if I may. Just on the Consumer Products business. Can you size just about, I guess, roughly how big the business is in China? Can that business in general, or should that business in general post the Shanghai opening really have a much bigger opportunity?\nBob Iger: Consumer Products in China is still somewhat small for us. We don't have stores we had some licensing, but by and large the numbers are fairly modest, but they are growing. We do believe that Shanghai will have an impact on the Disney brand in China, which should affect both, Consumer Products, and well actually movies and television post-opening, but we have no idea what that will be, but clearly it is a growth market for us. It's become one of the largest markets in the world from a movie perspective, because of all the added screens that have gone into China. The product will have obviously a big effect on the future of our business there, so we continue to believe and are very bullish in that market.\nAlexia Quadrani - JPMorgan:  Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nDouglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank: Thanks so much. One for Bob and one for Jay. Bob, I think there was a natural limit to the number of brands each business or one company could support, so maybe it's an odd question but I'm curious if you see any challenges managing these many franchises and any comment about the company's ability to build more franchises at this point? Jay, did affiliate revenue benefit in the quarter from a higher accrual rate for DISH even though the DISH deal wasn't done and do you plan on ever signing a DISH deal? Thanks.\nBob Iger: I think, we do plan on signing a DISH deal. Look, I think the key brands of the company are ESPN, Disney, obviously, Marvel, Pixar, Lucas, ABC. We are not really looking to build additional brands right now either organically or through acquisition, but these brands all have a lot of growth potential both, by mining them better across platforms and across the world but also by creating new franchises within each brand, so we have already demonstrated. For instance, under Marvel, just how strong The Avengers franchise is, and as my remarks indicated, what impact that has on the individual components Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, specifically. We are trying and believe we have a real opportunity to create other franchises under Marvel, Guardians of the Galaxy is the next one up which is for next summer or coming summer, so we think that the opportunity for franchise building, given all the characters and storytelling capabilities of these businesses are great for the company. We don't really have a problem managing the array of brands that we have. We actually think that we are in quite an enviable position. We met recently just to look at our movie slate going forward and everything seems to be fitting in nicely. Meaning, we don't seem to be proud or bumping up against sort of one another within the company and we think that we really are well positioned to take advantage of the marketplace without really creating traffic jams.\nDouglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Great.\nJay Rasulo: Relative to DISH, Doug, I'm not going to comment on the financial terms of that renewal, but as Bob had said before, we continue to expand our agreement with them as we continue to have productive forward looking conversation that we believe will result in us moving forward with them for the long-term.\nDouglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank: Jay, specifically I was just wondering if the December quarter benefitted from your estimates as to what the new rate card would be, so in other words the benefit of DISH renewal already begun or is it delayed until a deal is actually signed?\nJay Rasulo: No. I understand your question, but I'm not going to give any guidance on that.\nOperator:\nDouglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson: Thanks. I have one for Jay, and one for Bob. Jay, thanks for giving the pace of all the [slate] affiliate revenue growth or domestic. That's one of my go-to questions, so let me ask this question. There is no real lumpiness in cable networks expansion in the past couple of quarters. If our math is right, this quarter costs were flat for cable in general, so if you talk a bit about expectations this fiscal year for cable expense growth and the phasing of that growth over the next fiscal year?\nJay Rasulo: Sure. Cable program expenses, we expect them to grow in high single digits for the entirety of fiscal '14, and of course that's mostly driven by ESPN. That will be very back-loaded this year, Michael. The reason for that is basically the kick-in of a series of new deals just to tick through the major league baseball, their contract will kick-in in Q3 and Q4, the NFL contractual increase in Q1 '14 and the new deal in Q4 '14 World Cup, which, you know when that is, in our third fiscal quarter and college football Q1 '14 in Q4 and the launch of the SEC Network, which will begin in Q4 '14, so most of those increases will occur in Q3 and Q4.\nMichael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson: Okay. Then for Bob, you guys had talked about the cost of MyMagic+ this quarter, but can you give us some indications of how the rollout's going on revenue and customer behavior, because per capita is really good at this point, so what's going on with MyMagic+?\nBob Iger: I can't quantify it from a financial perspective yet. It's still early and we are still rolling out facets of it. What I can say is, that what has been rolled out has been a real success both, for the guest and for us. To give you, for instance, our Parks people in Walt Disney World believe during the peak holiday season that we were able to accommodate about 3,000 more additional guests in the Magic Kingdom per day. Thanks to Magic+. One of the most attractive features, and one that I think will have possibly the biggest benefit, is the FastPass+, which is the ability to reserve three times on three attractions per day, either before you visited the park if you are a resort guest or on the day that you enter the park if you are a same day or a single day ticket holder. What we are seeing there is substantially higher utilization of that product among our guests than we saw with the traditional FastPass, by the way by a wide margin. Since the goal of this was to make the guest experience better, enable the guests to experience more, to do some more efficiently and essentially to be able to customize, we think that these are very, very good signs for us, because clearly guest satisfaction is very, very important to the value equation for us both, how they spend their time when they are with us and the determining factor in terms of whether they come back, so, this is all very good. I'd say the biggest impact is, one, being able to accommodate more people. This is just more efficient. Secondly, enabling guests to have a substantially better experience than they have had before, because they are doing more.\nJay Rasulo: Michael, since you mentioned the higher spending. We reported out 170 basis points, but our margin improvement this quarter, but actually on an underlying operating basis, the quarter is actually even stronger than that because everything that Bob just mentioned we are in rollout, the new initiatives are a drag on our margins almost to the tune of 190 basis points. Now there are some pension benefit in there that we have talked about before at the Parks guest, but when you look at adding back 190 basis points to the 170 basis points we reported, so very strong operating quarter for Parks and Resorts.\nMichael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson: Thanks, Jay. Thanks, Bob.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks. I guess, at this point, follow-up to some of the questions asked, but Bob just on the film strategy overall, you have such a unique strategy with these very definable brands and each studio I guess doing one to two films per annum, so I was just wondering is there a benefit in terms of marketing cost, because they are focused what you are getting with Marvel or Pixar and what's the effect to other Disney businesses? I mean obviously there is a huge benefit in these franchise from home entertainment and consumer products, but is there somebody like a tie ratio that's it's like a relative improvement that you know is coming because of these kinds of films?\nBob Iger: Yeah. Well, there's definitely benefit on the marketing front. When you put the name Marvel on a movie, we think that it gives us essentially a head start with the audience. Just by the way the anticipation of these of films suggest that, before we even go into the marketplace with the significant marketing spend, awareness among the potential audience is very, very high. Now that's the probably the most obviously when it comes to Star Wars, but I have really been impressed with the early buzz that we're seeing for the Marvel films. Captain America is just huge now. We are already in the marketplace with some marketing but it has been relatively limited. We had a pre-game, for instance, in the Super Bowl and yet didn't, so to speak, in the interest in The Captain America film, which comes out here in the States April 4th, seems much louder that it would be for, well, I'll call it non-branded film. I believe that Marvel, Pixar, Disney, certainly Lucas, Star Wars all basically fall under similar categories. The ripple effect across all of our business from these films is already not only clear, but pretty significant for us and we believe it will only grow in significance. Frozen probably is a great example. Now, you have seen countless times over the past, where a big franchise animated film has really the ability to lift the number of our businesses. We have gotten that over the last ten years mostly from our Pixar films, the fact that we are starting to generate that form Disney films, Tangled, a great example of that. This is a huge example suggest that we are creating some momentum there. Of course, the consumer products obviously, what we are doing in the bottom line in terms of music, the impact course on home video all big, but for instance one of the characters in Frozen with a host of a Christmas show, the World of Color or the holiday World of Color version at California Adventure, before the movie even opened and there were a huge crowds just to see the character and the movie wasn't in the marketplace, so that ended up obviously helped us - movie came out. I think that there a, I hate to use the word synergy, maybe the better word is our ability to leverage the success of these characters and franchises not just across the Company, but across the world is, I think, really significant and will only grow in significance. Also, just a few other things, we announced an Iron Man attraction for Hong Kong. We've talked about developing more Star Wars presence at the park. We don't have specifics there, but I can tell you there is a lot of active development there not just for domestic products, but for some of our international locations. You will see Frozen in more places than you have certainly seen today. There is much more potential from Marvel in certain products too. What we are doing on the interactive front, I think, is also key. The fact that the Infinity game did so well as great in 1.0, but you can imagine what will happen when we fuel future iterations of that game with an even broader set of our stories, our intellectual property, and our brands. There is just a lot. I know that I sound like a huge cheerleader for the Disney brands, but I obviously, I'm feeling rather enthusiastic today because of these earnings, but continue to feel very optimistic about the potential.\nJessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: No. It's obvious you have a very unique strategy in the [businesses]. Then just my second question on MyMagic+, I know you said the benefit of guest satisfaction, but there must be some benefit to revenue to be able to put a device button, get out of the store, run to doors quickly. Is it showing up in the per cap revenues? On the cost side, how much more is there to go? How much more it is there to go now?\nBob Iger: Well, look, what we spend and how we account for it, I don't really want to get into that. There's some impact on the bottom line, but this is still a very new product, so we are not even close to being able to quantify it. In a public sense, fact, we are actually just learning more about how it's working and what impact it is having on our business today. I think you may be jumping to conclusions that the per cap spending was the direct result of MyMagic+ at this point, it's still a little bit early. It's possible that it had some impact, but I can't say today that we know for sure that it did. We do know, as I said, talking to George Kalogridis who runs Walt Disney World, [said] this morning that he really believes that he was able to accommodate 3,000 more people a day in the busiest period of the year in the Magic Kingdom, which is our number one park. That obviously has bottom line value, but we can't tell you what that is.\nJessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nTodd Juenger - Sanford Bernstein: Hi. Thank you. A quick one for Jay, and then one for Bob. Jay, just on A&E Television. Last quarter, I think we saw some surprising softness there. This quarter looks to come through particularly strong. Can you just comment like is either quarter more emblematic of how that business is performing or is the right answer somewhere in between? Thanks. Then Bob, I was wondering what you think about like, what comes next at Interactive. You started talking about it few minutes ago in your fork lifting of all the great brand things at Disney, but you've been marching with a goal of profitability there for a long time and so you have gotten there, so what now? How big can that be? Are there more big products launches like Infinity to come, or do you just keep adding that for a while? Where do you want to take that business over the next X number of years? Thanks.\nJay Rasulo: Thanks, Todd. Starting with AETN. I would look at last quarter more of an outlier than I would this quarter. They basically saw higher advertising revenue driven by shows that you can probably tick off as easily as I can, Duck Dynasty, Pawn Stars, Ax Men, Dance Moms and on Lifetime, they have got some new scripted shows, so that's basically what is driving their success. They had some lower programming and marketing cost this quarter, but in general we are incredibly happy with our investment in A&E and I think that you can continue to look for good things there.\nBob Iger: On the interactive front, Todd, there will be new iterations of Infinity, what that game prove to us is the strength of that platform of basically the game-play itself which was great, and the fact that Disney characters, Disney intellectual property could work on that platform, so that's a big deal, so what's next of course is, new iterations of that, a 2.0 or 3.0 and mining a broader set of our more popular characters. What we are doing, the rest of Interactive, you will see more licensing rather than publishing on the console side, except for Infinity. We are also basically tracking what we are seeing in the industry, doing a fair amount of work at creating efficiencies and moving off of some of the more traditional platforms into mobile-to-mobile space, mostly for social games and for other casual games. That's a big move for us and some of the announcements that were made this week are indicative of a shift in strategy there to both, reduce our spending in that space and to basically seek to grow the business where the customers or the users are which is more on mobile front. I think, those are the two, Infinity and then a move to mobile, basically for all our games, the two big trends you will see. Again, all with an eye toward not just being profitable but improving profitability, and no guidance there in terms of how profitable this could become.\nTodd Juenger - Sanford Bernstein: All right. Thank you for preempting my call. Thank you, Bob.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Thank you. Jay, I want to come back to the ESPN comments you made. First, on the expense side, I think you said high single-digit programming cost for the year for the cable segment, so overall mid-singles and you include SG&A and I don't know if you wanted to quantify the U.K. impact on the revenue and line in the quarter, but just trying to get a better sense to serve the organic trends in the ESPN business.\nJay Rasulo: Thanks, Ben. On coming back to the U.K. question, so you know that this was an unprofitable business for ESPN. In round numbers, the impact is about $20 million of benefit to the quarter, and they had round number $65 million of affiliate revenue that flowed to that company and obviously the expenses were higher.\nBen Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Okay, and you made a comment in your prepared remarks that you were reminding us this is the last quarter of benefiting for some renewals. Are you suggesting there should be a bit of a slowdown in the March quarter on domestic affiliate? I just wanted to ask you a follow-up on that point.\nJay Rasulo: I'm not going to give you a prediction on what those numbers will look like. I'm just saying that we, as of next quarter, will be lapping those. I think it was five affiliate deals that were renewed in prior year.\nBen Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Got it. Then just lastly, Bob, on the film business, one of the things that's been a headwind in the industry has been home video and I am wondering if you are feeling a little better about the outlook there given some of the successes on digital and EST. Is it sort of too early to get excited, or do you feel that maybe that business, that part of the film business starts to grow from here?\nBob Iger: Well, as at least as we it if you look back on '13 across the industry, you saw a low double-digit declines and I think the number I heard was 13% on the physical sales sides and an increase of about 50% on the digital side. Obviously, on a much smaller base. The result of both was that home video was relatively not flat for, the year. I guess that is a good sign, because the continued deterioration of the physical goods side at least is being mitigated somewhat by digital. We have been bullish about digital, particularly our prospects in digital, because we think we got brand advantage there by creating destinations on digital platforms before our brands. I think Marvel, Disney, Pixar, Lucas, for instance. We think there will be opportunities either through current digital emporiums, emporia or directly, but I think it's still early in terms of just how significant that all could be. I think the bottom line is that we are making movies that we believe stand a better chance of doing well in the secondary markets than non-branded, non-franchise movies, particularly movies that are directed at families.\nBen Swinburne - Morgan Stanley: Thank you very much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Please go ahead.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura: Thanks very much. Couple on ESPN. The 10% ad sales growth in the quarter. Just wondering, Jay, maybe if you could talk about the drivers of that. You were able to grow ad sales through some of the rating softness and just wanted to hear about how are drivers there. Then looking to the next quarter, if we were to kind of exclude the impact from the Olympics that you mentioned in your prepared remarks, what would be recurring ad sales growth of ESPN look like? Thanks and I have a follow up.\nJay Rasulo: Okay. Well, I hate to be topological, but what was really the ad revenue growth are the rates that ESPN received for the ad that sold in its programming and I think I also mentioned, but if I didn't, I will tell you that the units were also up for the quarter and that was somewhat offset by the lower ratings that you mentioned, so that was really the driver there. Relative to the Olympics, we don't expect there to be a significant impact on our networks from the Olympic period coming forward. Nothing, I would say de minimis, if I were to describe it.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura: Okay. Just a quick follow-up about the launch of the SEC Network, we would love to hear a little bit more about if you could just remind us about the opportunity there in terms of ad sales growth, affiliate fee growth, and will they be any launch cost associated? You mentioned about the right fees hitting, but are there any other launch costs that we should be mindful of as it pertain to SEC Network? Thanks.\nJay Rasulo: Well, obviously, Anthony, there will be production costs associated with the SEC Network in addition to the rights costs from the conference, but I don't like to predict out of the future in terms of what the rates and subscribers will look like as we ramp that up. Suffice to say, we are extremely excited about this opportunity. Anyone who is at all interested in college football is well aware of the impact of the SEC, not only in the States that encompass the schools, but more broadly because of their powerhouse nature in college football and we feel great about the opportunity to sign a long-term deal with them.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Bank from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDavid Bank - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks very much. This question is I guess for Bob. Bob, as improved VOD technology is being deployed and consumer behavior suggests they are sort of poised to [DVR] usage as the preferred method of time shift viewing. Disney and the rest of the existing TV ecosystem have opportunity to sort of out Netflix (Inaudible) you can enable viewers to sort of binge on stacked episodes of the best shows on television and you don't need digital SVOD services, but the issue with the opportunity seems to be that some of the contracts that you all signed with these digital guys limits the amounts of episodes you can stack on VOD. I guess my question is in the long run do you think that structure needs to change, would you like to see full seasoned stacking on VOD? What is stopping that? How do you see it evolving?\nBob Iger: That's a very good question. Our feeling on this first of all that product is differentiated from Netflix, and that Netflix, at least their off network deals offering prior seasoned shows, first of all, for subscription. The VOD largely has look back of five episodes. The demand for essentially a full season which is think is growing, is out there but I think that's an opportunity in terms of monetization for us, either directly from the consumer or by the distributor or from the distributor I should say. If distributors are going to be given the ability to offer their customers essentially same season, full season stacking then there is a cost associated with this and we expect to get paid for it, again, an interesting opportunity for us. The other opportunity, of course, is a world where consumers do not have the burden of having to set their DVRs for shows and in effect have access to many more shows without having to essentially do something premeditated or before-a-show-airs perspective. That will increase, in my opinion the non-live viewing of programming and then the question is what is our monetization capability there? Right now, there is some disablement of the commercial skipping in the C3 window, and so we are actually getting ratings for and thus getting paid by advertisers in that window. If consumption increases there and I believe it will because of the availability or the ease of use in that window then I think that monetization can increase as well. That's why I think it's very, very important for us in that window to protect the value of a commercial. Eventually, there will be dynamic ad insertion and that will, I think, result in even more opportunities for IP owners or networks to monetize, but that's just starting.\nDavid Bank - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi. Please go ahead.\nJason Bazinet - Citi: Thanks so much. This is second quarter in a row. I just wasn't surprised with the strength in your consumer products division and I was just wondering if you may not have this, but is there any rule of thumb you could share with us in terms of the linkage between box-office growth and Consumer Products sales? In other words, if the movie sort of naturally fits towards selling consumer products you will do $10 at box-office, you will do x dollars in consumer products and the reason I ask is my sense is this could be very big as we glide towards Star Wars VII? Thanks.\nBob Iger: Jason, there is no rule of thumb, because it's not really about box-office. Although box-office has an impact. It's about whether the storytelling and the characters easily leveraged or adapted to various forms of consumer products, whether it's toys or books or whatever clothing, you name it, so it's more about that. If you have both, with Frozen as a good case in point, you also play patterns, for instance, Princess. You've got great characters, you've got great music and you have huge box-office. That's as good as it gets. The Marvel movies tend to fit into that category, as we know, not all at an equal level, but certainly they have that opportunity and then you mentioned Star Wars, of course, that's probably the at the top of the heap. Cars was another great example of that. Obviously, box-office has an impact because it suggests popularity of characters and stories, but you still have to have the right characters and stories to ultimately monetize on the Consumer Products side. Also, it's not just about movies, it's also about television, so if you look at Disney consumer products today and you look at the last couple of quarters, one of the reasons why you continue to see growth is the success of programs on Disney Junior, which is a platform that we only launched within the last year and it suddenly hit big in terms of interest with young kids two to five, where actually it's done well in ratings even kids older than five, with a number of shows Doc McStuffins and Sofia the first two obvious examples that are very monetizable on the consumer products front.\nJason Bazinet - Citi: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMarci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo: Thanks. I've two quick questions. First, it sounds like there was a benefit from the absence of EPSN Star Sports, so how much of a drag was this last year in the comparable quarter? Then secondly, Jay, you mentioned fiscal Q2, there'll be a loss in Interactive and can you just talk about what that's from?\nJay Rasulo: Starting with your second question, our results at Interactive are very tied to game releases. In Q2, we are not releasing any big games. Obviously, you know the division continues in terms of its production capabilities and distribution capabilities, so without the release of a title of significant revenue, we are going to have some downdraft in those quarters. To your first question, relative to ESS, STAR Sports. Look, round numbers, it's about $20 million of drag that we got to release from this quarter.\nMarci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Miller from Topeka Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDavid Miller - Topeka Capital Markets: Congratulations on a stellar results. Bob, I'm just curious if you guys are in negotiations with the domestic theater circuit here, so far on Star Wars. Are you in discussions with these guys about maybe taking advantage of just pent up demand here? A massive amount of pent-up demand, and maybe gunning for more than 52% on theatrical splits or are you just not there yet. It's just too early? Anything you are willing to tell us would be great. Thanks very much.\nBob Iger: We did some new deals with the domestic distributors within the last year. I'm not aware that we are in negotiations now, but we did some deals last year and those deals reflected the strength of our studio slate in the year and years to come, so that would obviously include Star Wars, and there are potentially additional opportunities worldwide, but I can't really comment further on the state of any negotiation or whether there is any negotiation going on.\nDavid Miller - Topeka Capital Markets: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tuna Amobi from S&P Capital IQ. Please go ahead.\nTuna Amobi - S&P Capital IQ: Hi. Thank you so much. Bob, with regard to the WATCH Apps, I was wondering if there is any new data points you can share with us and I know you had outlined various avenues to monetize that. If you can update us on which of those you see getting the most traction would be helpful. Then separately for Jay, your retail business, I believe in North America, clearly I think seems to be outperforming the overall industry for the holiday season. I know a lot of retailers had actually reported lackluster results and you guys have put together some really consecutive streak there, so I'm just wondering what you see as the main driver add or are there any trends that you see in terms of any particular items or [SKUs] that are driving the momentum any kind of color for the future would also be helpful. Thank you.\nBob Iger: To get them to carry the WATCH App and to enable us to monetize them, that's the component of the negotiations that are underway right now, so growth and adoption will come in part from not just consumer demand, but new deals that we cut. We are also seeing some modest advertising growth. We believe that will increase obviously with greater adoption, but also when we start getting more meaningful data from Nielsen on consumption on mobile platforms, so all very positive as we are concerned and clearly the quality of the devices is improving as well both, from a speed perspective, the quality of screens and that's a good sign too.\nJay Rasulo : On your question on North American stores, Tuna, obviously we are very, very happy with the development of our North American retail business. I think, I mentioned this two year in a row every quarter. We have seen ups. You know what? there are a couple of pieces to that. First of all, you will recall that we have reoriented our stores in our best locations, which are more franchised-focused from what they were before which for lack of a better term, I'll call a more emporium focus. Highlighting franchises that are hot and popular, that's had a definite impact on the results of the Disney Store, and it has resulted not only in quarter-to-quarter higher comp sales, but also higher gross margins across as we get to really front items that have better margins and those items end up getting purchased in part because of how they are merchandised, but you can't forget the power of the franchises that backs those. Over the most recent quarter, obviously, if I had to pick out a single item, I would say Frozen items were the single-most demanded items at Disney Store, but quickly followed by the power of the Disney Junior properties that have come on amazingly strong. The combination of powerful franchisees as Bob mentioned 10 or 15 minutes ago in terms of the quality that drives consumer products in addition to just better merchandising has resulted in much better results over the last couple of years.\nTuna Amobi - S&P Capital IQ: Okay. That's very helpful. Did the new concept have anything to do with that at all? I know you were starting to roll that out a couple of years ago. Where do you stand with that now?\nJay Rasulo: Yes. That was the first thing I said as we renovated a lot of - we are up to almost a 100 stores now worldwide renovated into IP, what we call imagination park stores, that really reoriented the way we merchandise to highlight franchises of the company rather than being an emporium style, where you might go to find anything Disney.\nTuna Amobi - S&P Capital IQ: Thank you so much.\nLowell Singer: Thanks. Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Okay. Our last question comes from Michael Morris from Guggenheim Securities Please go ahead.\nMichael Morris - Guggenheim Securities: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Two questions. One is just back on the strength in advertising of the ESPN in the quarter. Can you talk a bit? Most of us believe that advertising on related to sports is more valuable due to the DVR resistant of the content. Can you talk about the relationship in pricing between sports inventory in general and entertainment inventory? Is it much higher on sports inventory and are you seeing the value increase at a faster pace there? Then secondly, talking about the films in China, you did the production partnership on Iron Man 3. Can you talk about whether or not you think that was a big contributor to the strength that that film had in China compared to the second film in the series and whether you plan to do more partnership like that in the future? Thanks.\nBob Iger: Thanks, Michael. On your question on advertising, look, I am not a 100% sure how to answer that, because obviously there is a wide variety of programming across the ESPN network, some that demand very high rates and some that go on a lesser rates, so I don't know how to compare that head-to-head to the kind of advertising on entertainment product. There is also the notion of the multiplatform capabilities of ESPN, that, of course, they have sold, we have talked about to you folks are very aggressively in that. Being number one in all, but magazine publishing in terms of platforms, really gives ESPN incredible leverage and advertisers lots of opportunities to take their products broadly to consumers where those consumers live today.\nJay Rasulo:  On the China question, the success of Iron Man 3, I think it was mostly due to the film itself and the continued interest in the knowledge of Marvel, and Iron Man, in that particular case. We think that the Marvel brand as it grows in China, bodes well for future films, starting with our next one. I don't think it's a function of necessarily of partnerships.\nMichael Morris - Guggenheim Securities: Maybe if I could, just on the first question, ask you it different way. For the same size audience is it more expensive to buy, let's say, a produced sporting event than it is a scripted original program that's because a lot - high quality program. If so, are you seeing a differential in, let's say, those two types of programs expanding as time progresses?\nBob Iger: Not sure if there's easy answer to that. You are selling basically the same size audience or a specific size audience within a demographic. Whether that's delivered in live or whether it's delivered in the C3 window. Now, obviously, C3 is not a selling demographic or a selling point in sports, because it is live but you are basically selling eyeballs whether they are delivered right away or within three days. I don't think you see a diminishment in quality if you deliver the eyeballs live versus if you deliver them within that window. There are plenty of entertainment programs that are sold on a C3 basis and with comparable ratings do just as well as sporting events. Again, with comfortable ratings. Again, I'm talking delivery of demographics. The advantage of course of live is that it doesn't fall out of the C3 window or the non-monetizable window, it's one of the reasons why we are all are interested in monetizing consumption beyond just three days. I was looking by the way at numbers for our prime time schedule and I was pretty impressed with the live LIVE+7 ratings. We have got shows that jump over 50% in 18 to 49 delivery in the L+7 rating category, and yet we are only monetizing C3, so that just speaks to more of an opportunity there, but I don't think you are seeing much of a differential in terms of absolute rates, again, for comparable audience delivery sports live versus another program that is not live.\nMichael Morris - Guggenheim Securities: Great. Thank you.\nBob Iger: Thanks, Mike. Thanks again everyone for joining us today.

Please note this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Good afternoon and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 45 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and an audio recording and transcript of the call will be available on our website. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Staggs, Chief Operating Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob, Tom, and Christine will each make some comments, and then, of course, we will be happy to take your questions. So with that, let me turn this over to Bob, and we can get started.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased with our results in Q4 with adjusted EPS of $1.20, up 35% over the prior-year. The strong performance capped our fifth consecutive year of record results, including historic revenue and net income and adjusted EPS of 19% to an all-time high of $5.15. These results reflect the collective talent and commitment of our employees and cast members around the world, and I'm both proud of their achievements and grateful for their contributions. Our performance continues to demonstrate the incredible strength of our brands and franchises, the extraordinary quality and robust pipeline of our creative content, our commitment to constant evolution as we adapt to emerging consumer trends and technology, and our unique, proven ability to leverage creative assets across our entire company to drive significant, long-term value. And Star Wars is an obvious example. We're still six weeks away from releasing the first new film in a decade, but you can already see the impact and value of that franchise in various businesses. We have Star Wars products in numerous retail categories, especially toys and games. And the huge global response to the brief glimpse of new merchandise we revealed on Force Friday in September, suggest the demand will only grow with the release of new movies. A new generation is connecting with Star Wars through Disney XD's animated series Star Wars Rebels; and fans and gamers around the world are anxiously awaiting the November 17 release of the highly anticipated Star Wars Battlefront from EA, praised as the ultimate Star Wars gaming experience. We're expanding the franchise in our Parks and Resorts, adding Star Wars theme lands and Disneyland and Disney World. And we're also using digital platforms to familiarize global consumers with the franchise and to market the film in truly innovative ways. And, of course, we're very excited about the December 18 release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. And if the reaction to the trailers and ticket presales are any indication, we're not the only ones. J.J. Abrams and his cast and crew have delivered a truly epic adventure, but what's even more exciting to us is that this movie is only the beginning of a new generation of phenomenal Star Wars storytelling. We'll have three new Star Wars films in theaters between now and the end of 2017 with even more to come. One of our greatest strengths is our willingness to embrace change and adapt to new trends and technology to create extraordinary experiences that are relevant to consumers. That's especially true in the media space. From our perspective, there are three key elements that are essential for success in media today. First, you have to have a quality product, preferably high-quality branded product. Next, you need to create a fantastic user experience with incredible interface navigation, you have to make the service easy-to-use and the content easy-to-find. And the third essential element is mobility. Consumers now dictate where they want to access media and it's essential for legacy distributors to crack the mobile code. The demand for great content is stronger than ever, but consumers are demanding a better user experience and they're migrating to platforms and services that deliver it. Because of our great brands and franchises, we're uniquely positioned to use new platforms to reach more people and to do so in more compelling ways. And we intend to use these platforms to augment distribution and connect with consumers more directly. And DisneyLife, our new direct-to-consumer service in the UK, is a perfect example. Launching later this month, DisneyLife will give users unprecedented access to the vast universe of Disney storytelling including hundreds of movies and thousands of TV episodes as well as music, books and more. It delivers a great experience with an incredible degree of personalization including the ability to watch and read in several different languages. The Disney branded content is fantastic, the user-friendly interface is very interactive and intuitive and it's designed to be mobile with apps for iOS and Android. So, we're three for three. We're very proud of this product, it definitely speaks to where we're going as a company and we see opportunities to grow the concept across other markets and perhaps other brands in the future. We're proud of our results this year and believe our continued strong performance validates our long-term strategy to drive growth and shareholder value. Tom will take you through some of the highlights and then we'll turn it over to Christine to walk you through the details of our fourth quarter and talk about some trends going forward. Tom?\nThomas O. Staggs - Chief Operating Officer: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As the media landscape continues to evolve, our uniquely valuable collection of in-demand brands and content, puts us in a great position to deliver extraordinary experiences across platforms in the ways that Bob just discussed. By doing so, we have the opportunity to increase our engagement and deepen our connection with consumers. ESPN is a perfect example. The brand is stronger than ever, thanks to the largest array of sports properties in the industry and ESPN's well-earned reputation amongst sports fans for consistently over-delivering, especially when it comes to live sports. In fiscal 2015, ESPN was the number one full-time cable network in all major demos, delivering more than half of the year's top 50 cable telecasts. ESPN's first college football playoff actually delivered the three biggest audiences in cable history, as well as an 83% ratings increase over the prior-year's bowl championship series. In addition to having the best portfolio of sports rights in the business, ESPN has been a multiplatform pioneer for years leveraging technology to keep fans connected to the best in sports wherever they are. Watch ESPN remains one of the most elegant and user-friendly mobile services in the market today and ESPN continues to innovate, creating and enhancing a very robust suite of services that are embraced by sports fans across the country. In September alone, 94.4 million fans spent 10.3 billion minutes engaging with ESPN on digital platforms, setting a new record for unique visitors and engagement in the sports category. The demand for sports programming, especially live sports, is incredibly strong. And no matter how they choose to engage, sports fans continue to trust ESPN to provide the best overall experience and the marquee events that matter most. Turning to our studios, our strategic focus on high-quality branded movies continues to drive value across our businesses. Since the respective acquisitions by Disney, Pixar movies have averaged roughly $660 million in global box office, and Marvel films have averaged about $820 million, and that success continues. The global box office receipts for Pixar's Inside Out are over $845 million to date. And Marvel's Ant-Man has totaled $515 million worldwide so far, exceeding the global box office totals on the original films for both Thor and Captain America. In addition to the Star Wars movies Bob mentioned, we have a spectacular slate of releases scheduled for 2016, representing our full array of fantastic brands, starting with the release of Pixar's The Good Dinosaur later this month. Disney Animation's Zootopia opens next March, followed by Disney's live-action adventure, The Jungle Book, in April. In May, we'll release Marvel's Captain America: Civil War. And later that month, Johnny Depp returns as the Mad Hatter in Alice through the Looking Glass. Fans of Pixar's Finding Nemo will finally get their wish for a sequel when Finding Dory opens in June. We've successfully introduced some fantastic but lesser-known superheroes into the Marvel cinematic universe with last year's Guardians of the Galaxy and again with Ant-Man this year, and we're looking forward to doing the same with Dr. Strange next year. We also have another great movie from Disney Animation, Moana, which will be in theaters for families to enjoy about a year from now. I've been at Disney a long time, and I can't remember a movie slate that comes close to this one. It truly reflects the strength of the unprecedented pipeline of extraordinary content being generated under our unparalleled portfolio of brands. One of the things we're most looking forward to in 2016, of course, is the grand opening of Shanghai Disney Resort next spring. We're well down the road o, the construction of this spectacular world-class destination in the most populous city in the most populous country on earth. As Bob has said, we committed ourselves to making this resort authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese. We were just there last week. It's extremely gratifying to see how well we're delivering on that promise. The park features some of the best in Disney storytelling and innovation we've ever achieved. And our collaboration with Chinese cultural experts, creative talent, and artisans is apparent throughout. At this point in the construction, all the major structures and landmarks are in place. You really get a sense of the phenomenal experience in store for our guests when they walk through the gates of this spectacular destination next spring. From the grand scale to the smallest detail, it's absolutely extraordinary, and it's something only The Walt Disney Company could create. We've begun holding a number of job fairs in China to find the talent we need to deliver the world-class experience guests expect from Disney, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. There's a palpable excitement in China about Shanghai Disney along with a great deal of pride, all of which we share. And now Christine will walk you through the details of our performance, and then we'll take your questions. Christine?\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding items affecting comparability, fourth quarter earnings per share were $1.20, an increase of 35% over last year, and for the full-year were a record $5.15. Fourth quarter and full-year results benefited from an additional week of operations in our fiscal calendar this year. Our fiscal 2015 earnings represent a record for the company, even after excluding the estimated effect of the 53rd week. The financial results this quarter and for the full year demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy of investing in high-quality branded content. I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our fourth quarter results in more detail, and then I'll highlight some factors that will impact our results in fiscal 2016. Studio Entertainment had another record year with almost $2 billion in operating income in fiscal 2015, 27% higher than last year. This is a business that only two years ago generated less than $700 million in operating income, so the growth demonstrates the power of the investments we've made and our ability to execute against our strategy. The success of the studio has been broad-based due to an unrivaled portfolio of film properties and our unique ability to take this great content and monetize it across multiple windows and businesses. Studio operating income more than doubled in the fourth quarter compared to last year due to growth in television distribution and higher worldwide theatrical results. Theatrical results reflected the performance of Inside Out and Ant-Man in the fourth quarter compared to the performance of prior-year releases, which included Guardians of the Galaxy and Maleficent. Studio operating income also benefited from lower impairments in the quarter compared to prior-year. At Media Networks, growth in operating income in the fourth quarter was driven by an increase in cable, while Broadcasting results were in line with the prior-year quarter. Growth in cable operating income was driven by ESPN and, to a lesser extent, worldwide Disney channels and higher-equity income from A&E. The increase at ESPN was driven by the benefit of the 53rd week and higher affiliate and advertising revenue. Programming costs were relatively flat in the quarter, as higher costs for a full quarter of the SEC Network, additional U.S. Open tennis rights, and contractual increases for Major League Baseball and the NFL were offset by the absence of rights costs for NASCAR. Domestic cable affiliate revenue was up 17% in the quarter and up 8% excluding the benefit of the 53rd week. Ad revenue at ESPN was up 5% in the quarter. Two factors affected the comparability of ESPN's ad growth in the quarter, the 53rd week and the absence of the Men's World Cup. We estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up 9% when you exclude the net impact of these two factors. So far this quarter, ESPN's ad sales are pacing up significantly compared to last year, reflecting a very strong advertising marketplace for sports and the timing of key college football bowl games. The six New Year's Eve and New Year's Day college football playoff bowl games, including the two semifinal games, will air in the first fiscal quarter this year, whereas these games aired during the fiscal second quarter last year. Broadcasting operating income was comparable to the prior-year quarter, as higher affiliate and advertising revenue were largely offset by higher programming costs, an increase in equity losses driven by Hulu, and lower income from program sales compared to the prior year. Programming costs were higher in the quarter due to an extra week of programming as well as an increase in marketing spend to support the launch of the fall season. The extra week had minimal impact to Broadcasting's operating income for the quarter, as the extra week of ad sales was roughly equal to the incremental programming spend. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was up mid-teens percent in the fourth quarter. Excluding the extra week, ad revenue was up mid-single digits. Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 16% above upfront levels. At Parks and Resorts, the investments we've made in our domestic parks continue to drive higher guest visitation. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 15% in the quarter and up 7% excluding the benefit of the 53rd week. Disneyland in particular saw very strong attendance growth due to tremendous excitement for the 60th anniversary celebration. Per capita spending was up 1% on higher admissions, merchandise and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 7% and occupancy was up one percentage point to 84%. Operating income growth at our domestic operations was due to the benefits of an additional week along with higher guest spending and attendance at our domestic theme parks, partially offset by higher costs. Operating income at our international operations was lower in the quarter due to a decline at Hong Kong Disneyland and higher pre-opening expenses for Shanghai Disney Resort. So far this quarter domestic resort reservations are pacing up 5% compared to prior-year levels, while booked rates are up 8%. At Consumer Products, operating income was higher in the fourth quarter as a result of growth in our licensing business, partially offset by higher marketing costs. Growth in licensing was driven by sales of Star Wars Classic, Avengers, and Frozen merchandise. On a comparable basis earned licensing revenue was up 9%. Licensing revenue and the 9% earned licensing revenue growth I just mentioned do not reflect the revenue from Q4 sales of Star Wars Episode VII merchandise, which we cannot recognize until the film is released. During the fourth quarter, the market presented us with an opportunity to repurchase our shares at very attractive levels. We repurchased almost 31 million shares for $3.3 billion in the quarter, bringing our fiscal 2015 share repurchase to about 60 million shares for approximately $6.1 billion. We've talked for a long time about the benefit of having a strong balance sheet. Our ability to significantly increase our pace of repurchase this quarter is a great example of this. Over the past five years, we've been able to repurchase about $25 billion of our stock at an average price of roughly $58 per share and we've accomplished this while actively investing for future growth and without compromising the strength of our balance sheet and the financial flexibility it provides. We will continue to be opportunistic in our approach to buying back our stock and we still expect to repurchase between $6 billion and $8 billion during fiscal 2016. Turning to fiscal 2016, I now want to highlight a couple of timing and comparability items and also provide some insight into our CapEx plan for the year. In fiscal 2016, ESPN does not have any major new sports rights contracts kicking in, so we expect total cable programming and production costs to be up low to mid-single-digits for the year. Earlier, I mentioned that the six New Year's Eve and New Year's Day college football playoff bowl games will air in fiscal Q1 this year compared to fiscal Q2 last year. As a result, the costs associated with these games will shift into Q1, so we expect total cable programming and production costs to be up high-teens in Q1 and to be down high-teens in Q2. At Parks and Resorts, quarterly results will be impacted by shift in the timing of the New Year and Easter holiday periods due to our fiscal calendar. The entire New Year's holiday period will fall in Q1 in fiscal 2016, whereas about a week of the holiday period fell in Q2 last year. We estimate this will shift about $90 million in operating income into Q1 this year that was recognized in Q2 last year. The Easter holiday period will fall during the second quarter this year, whereas the holiday fell during the third quarter last year. As a result, we will recognize about $90 million in operating income in Q2 this year that we've recognized in Q3 last year. We have demonstrated our ability to deploy capital profitably across the company, including at Parks and Resorts. We've announced a number of new Parks and Resorts projects that will be underway during fiscal 2016. As a result, these projects will collectively drive an increase in total company CapEx of about $800 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. As Tom discussed, we are very excited to open Shanghai Disney Resort later this fiscal year. As we've said in the past, preopening expenses will ramp up considerably, and we estimate these preopening expenses to be a little under $300 million in 2016. Fiscal 2015 was another great year for the company. Given the strength of our brands and the relentless focus on creativity and innovation, we will continue to execute against our strategy, which should benefit shareholders in 2016 and in the years to come. I'll now turn the call back over to Lowell for Q&A.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Okay. Thanks, Christine. Operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Thank you. I have two for Bob. Bob, as you know, seldom have words on a conference call created so much analysis as yours did last quarter. I wonder now that we're 90 days past the last conference call, if there's anything that you feel you need to clarify or return to given the world's reaction to those comments? And the second question would be, there was a report in the Sports Business Journal last week that ESPN had traded price inflation for lower minimum guarantees. And we feel there are a ton of calls whether or not there's a risk that ESPN could be hurt by skinny bundles over time. I wonder if you could comment about that too.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Regarding your first question, there is nothing that I would either retract or in any way change. To just reiterate what we did, we updated guidance that we had given in 2014 about ESPN sub-fees, and that guidance holds today. We also decided to be candid, I think maybe refreshingly so, about what the industry was experiencing in terms of sub losses during roughly the last period. And we feel that there certainly should be no reason to panic over comments like that. The fact remains that we're in an environment today that's definitely changing, it's different than the environment before, there's a lot more competition for people's time. With that interestingly enough, we have an opportunity to distribute our content in many different ways than we ever have before \u2013 in more different ways than we ever have before. So, there's not only a silver lining, but there's a glass-half-full perspective on this and that's what we have. We also know specifically, related to ESPN that not only is the brand strong, which is evidenced, by the way in the ratings, 50 of the top cable shows in fiscal 2015 \u2013 of the 50 top cable shows in fiscal 2015, 26 were ESPN's. And in addition to that, live television and live sports, in particular, is incredibly strong in this environment. Demand for it has probably never been greater, interestingly enough. So that's I guess a long way around my saying that we don't have anything to really add to the comments that we made. We feel bullish about ESPN and ESPN's business. We like the environment, because we think long-term it gives us more opportunities. I should also add that ESPN has been at the forefront of using technology to create more compelling product for its consumers and to be present on more platforms. In terms of your second question, Michael, we really don't comment specifically about aspects of the negotiations or the deals that we have with the multichannel distributors. I can only say, specifically related to your question that that article was not factually correct.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Thanks, Bob.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Thanks, Michael. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: And your next question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you, two questions. My first one is Disney recently made several new announcements on over-the-top with DisneyLife in the UK and I think today with Sony Vue. Do you view these as potentially additive, I think, financially to Disney, or more filling a potential hole for subscriber losses over time? And then my second question is just on the Consumer Products commentary about Star Wars. I guess any way you can help us quantify, I think, what the opportunity there for Consumer Products is, both big picture, but also in terms of the shift that we're going to see into the December quarter?\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We are looking at a number of new opportunities to distribute our content. I guess there are different ways you could look at it. We believe that we're seizing these opportunities to augment what is still a primary form of us delivering content to consumers on the TV side, and that's the multichannel package through MVPDs. DisneyLife is a direct-to-consumer proposition that we're launching in the UK in a few weeks. We've already commented about it publicly. But to reiterate, it's essentially an app experience, which we like because the app experience tends to be far more rich and textured and a better user interface, which is really important. I'm going to come back to that, Alexia. It has hundreds of movies, thousands of TV shows, songs, books, and games, and we like the concept from a consumer proposition perspective. We believe there will be other opportunities outside of the UK, and we believe there will be other opportunities like that for some of our other brands, but we're not rushing into that right now. I also think what you're seeing in the multichannel environment is you're probably seeing some attrition, which is always the case, from current large-bundle subscribers. Most of that is due to economic factors. At the same time, we think it's possible that young people are not signing up as quickly as they once did. And we think that points to a pretty interesting dynamic, and that relates to cost and user experience. And we think that the primary ingredients for success in media today is, one, you've got to have great product. We certainly have that. The user interface has to be great, and that means easy-to-find, easy-to-use product. And we challenge all the legacy distributors to deliver that because we think that could be one of the factors in terms of why young people aren't signing up. And the third thing is mobility. People want to watch these channels and these programs on mobile devices. And frankly, the experience, when you try to do that as a multichannel subscriber, is not as easy or as good as it needs to be. So they're being challenged by these new entrants, and we're seizing the opportunity to basically distribute our content with these new entrants because we think they deliver better user experiences. And the price-to-value relationship, particularly for some of the smaller bundles that are out there, also tends to be attractive to younger people. So we're going to continue to look for opportunities. We like the trend. We think that the more the merrier in terms of new platforms. And it's clear also, and Sony Vue is a great example of that, that these platforms cannot launch successfully without the array of channels that we provide. And they came to us to negotiate a deal because it was clear the product that they had launched was not penetrating the marketplace as much as I think they expected, and they needed ESPN, Disney, and ABC. Do you want to handle the Consumer Products question on Star Wars?\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: Hi, Alexia. Regarding your question on Consumer Products, we were very pleased with the earned licensing revenue of 9% in the quarter, but that was driven by Star Wars Classic, Avengers, and Frozen. What it didn't include was the merchandise related to Star Wars Episode VII. And the reason it didn't was because there's an accounting rule that doesn't allow merchandise with the new IP attached to it to be recognized until after the film is released. So while we are very encouraged by the results of Force Friday and the continued performance of that Episode VII merchandise that's already in the marketplace, that result will be included in our first quarter results for Consumer Products.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, thank you very much.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Thanks, Alexia. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: And the next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, thank you. I have two questions. First, on Hulu, you mentioned in the press release and actually in the call that there were losses in fiscal 2015 and further investment in fiscal 2016. I was wondering if you could, one, quantify it; and two, talk about how Hulu strategically can benefit Disney over coming years. And the second question relates to Shanghai. Tom and Bob, since you just came back, can you give us an update on, one, have you changed anything regarding expectations? How big do you ultimately think you will get in China, and how do you think Shanghai Disneyland will impact other parts of your business there?\nThomas O. Staggs - Chief Operating Officer: So, Jessica, let me talk about Hulu. I'll leave it to them to speak of the specifics of their investment, but it's true that Hulu has and is going to continue to step up their investment in both acquiring and producing original programming and programming from others, and that will continue to increase their losses in the near term. We believe it's going to create value over time, and we think there's value in them strengthening their offering. And furthermore, the market is big enough for them and others to thrive. So we feel good about where they're going strategically.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Regarding Shanghai, we haven't really changed expectations, I think, about anything, except that from the time that we broke ground until now, we did decide to build a larger park for opening, and with that came a delay in terms of when it would open. I think we initially anticipated it would open in the latter part of this calendar year. And once we decided to build a larger park, which we're glad about, we pushed it into 2016. What we're currently thinking is that it will open sometime in the spring of 2016. And we're guessing that sometime between now and the end of this calendar year, we'll announce an opening date. We feel great about what we're building and we still feel great about the market. We continue to be impressed with the buzz that we see whenever we go to China. You're right, we were there last week and three weeks before that and it is in fact the talk of the town. And we think for good reason; not only is it highly anticipated as a product, but interest in Disney is significantly higher now than it's ever been, thanks in part to the growth in the movie industry. So we think this is a big event. We love what it represents on many levels. More than anything else we think it's a great opportunity for us to grow our business in Asia; and particularly, in China, and with the experience we expect to deliver with what we're building, we think it's going to open up the door for even more opportunities there, both in Shanghai and around China.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Thanks, Jessica. Operator, next question please?\nOperator: And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Please go ahead.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thanks. I have two. First for Bob, in light of the conversation that's topical about retaining SVOD rights, ABC sold How to Get Away with Murder to Netflix recently. And I'm just hoping you can walk us through your latest thinking around the SVOD marketplace. And then secondly, I suppose for whomever would like to take it, I wanted to ask about the layoff announcement at ESPN. And if you could, just please talk about that decision. How should investors interpret what's going on at ESPN? Should we assume that this is the thing that ESPN might have to do in order to make room for rights fee increases in the coming years? Thank you.\nThomas O. Staggs - Chief Operating Officer: So I'll start with the ESPN question. The best interpretation of that is that you should see this as not connected to anything else. ESPN is quite healthy operationally. But at the same time, we have and we'll continue to assess our operations. We're going to not let any of them stand still and we're focused on driving all of them to be both effective and efficient as they move forward. So, ESPN has been innovating all along and they're going to continue to do so and that impacts how they position themselves and how they staff.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Regarding the decision we made on How to Get Away with Murder and the relationship with Netflix, we've had a good relationship with Netflix. They've been extremely aggressive buyers of our content. A movie deal kicks in starting in 2016, and they've bought both original programming, the Marvel program is a good example and a lot of off-network programming from us. And those decisions were all made to monetize our content at the highest levels. In fact, as I've said, we've never seen greater demand for our content than we're seeing today. I think it's really important for us \u2013 I can't speak for the whole industry, to maintain flexibility, because it's a dynamic marketplace, it continues to change. And that essentially means that when we made these decisions to sell these shows to Netflix, those decisions made the most sense for us in terms of the economics. Longer-term, it's possible that we'll make different decisions based on other factors, and it is possible that off-network programs will end up either being bundled with our multichannel services or as part of apps that the company brings out to sell directly to customers as is the case with DisneyLife. Most important thing for us in this is flexibility and that's what we have maintained and what we'll continue to maintain.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thanks very much.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you, Anthony. Operator, next question please?\nOperator: And the next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from UBS. Please go ahead.\nDoug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks very much, a question for Bob and a clarification from Christine. So, Bob, I was hoping you could give further details of the strategic rationale for DisneyLife, because, as you said, it speaks to where the company is going. I know you talked about it, but why the UK rather than the U.S., and how did you arrive at that price point? How much overlap, if any, is there with the content that you are distributing on your networks through the pay-TV platform in the UK?\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We're launching in the UK for a variety of reasons. One, it's a strong Disney market, huge affinity for the Disney brand and so we wanted to test this in the market where there was already strong brand affinity. Second, we looked carefully at what was available to us to put on this platform, because we obviously have to factor in \u2013 speaking of flexibility, by the way \u2013 deals that already exist that encumber us from getting access to the product to sell on our own. And we had an opportunity to bring this to market in a manner that worked in relation to the product available and the deal that we have mostly with Sky in the UK. And we're doing this, because when you look at technology today \u2013 and I know that Apple referred to this when it announced its Apple TV product \u2013 the app experience is, I'll call it 3D experience versus the 2D experience that linear television offers. Because you can go to an app and you can choose from a menu of multiple choices in terms of media and you can essentially use it in ways that we think are far more compelling and typically a better user experience. And I mentioned that earlier, I can't emphasize that enough. I think today's consumer, when they're faced with a user experience that is sub-par, where they just can't find anything, they can't navigate things or they find them and they just don't work well \u2013 you don't keep a consumer. It used to be you don't keep a consumer happy; now it's you don't keep a consumer, because they have other choices. So, we like the app-based experience. We're also very interested in taking product directly to consumers as a company. If you look at the profile of this company, outside of the Disney stores and our theme park business, the customers that buy Disney typically buy through third parties. There's nothing wrong with that, by the way, we do great business with movie theater chains and big-box retailers and multichannel distributors. But, given the way the world is and what technology makes available, and given the passion that our customers have for our brands; Marvel, Disney, Pixar, ESPN, Star Wars, we have an opportunity to reach the consumer directly in ways that our competitors can't come close to doing. So, it is a competitive advantage and it is an opportunity that technology is providing us, and it's something ultimately that you'll see more of, both from a consumer proposition perspective and from a company perspective.\nDoug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you, Bob.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: The pricing, we debated a lot about. We're going to market with a price that we think reflects the value of the product that we're offering and the experience that we're offering. I can't tell you that we're absolutely certain, it's the right price, it's the price that we decided to take it out to the market with. And what we do know is, we've created an elegant product, it's a really good user experience, we love the look, the feel and the navigation, and we'll see. It also has the ability to provide the content in multi-languages, for instance, so you can imagine the opportunities in terms of other markets both in Europe and the rest of the world. And it is also technology we can use for those other brands.\nDoug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you, Bob. Very helpful.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Doug.\nDoug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC: And, Christine, just Shanghai Park launch losses a little under $300 million in fiscal 2016, to be clear? Is that only up until the launch, or is that meant to be an estimate for full-year 2016 for the park? Thank you.\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: Yeah, that's a full-year estimate for the year.\nDoug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Thanks, Doug. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: And our next question comes from David Bank from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDavid Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thanks. I have two questions. A little bit of a follow-up on the last two questions to start with. It seems that, Bob, in particular, you have always stood out as kind of a thought and action leader with respect to these new distribution technologies. You just kind of termed it flexibility, I think. The first live streaming cable app, the first streaming broadcast network app, the first iTunes episodic content deal, probably the first to sign a light domestic streaming cable product. Now the first do a direct consumer branded subscription product in the UK. So, clearly, you're comfortable with this. I guess the question is, does thought leadership and flexibility, though, mean at some point you kind of have the ability to move in the opposite direction, right? And that all these things that have worked so well for you have essentially allowed you to sell what you already have for more money, you know an authenticated app. You are making more money, and you're not breaking up the bundle. Do you think we are at the point where the sale of SVOD content, given the way it fragments the audience, could ultimately be damaging the ecosystem such that you might use flexibility to pull content back from that kind of platform? I guess that's such a long question. Let me leave it at that, and thanks for answering it.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think you were complimenting me, and I appreciate that. I'll comment on that and I'll comment on the crux of this matter or the question. I'm struck with something that Steve Jobs once said, when he was asked about technology and how he developed it. And he said that he starts with the consumer and he works backward to technology. And we're actually doing that, too. We're thinking about the consumer and the consumer today is a different consumer than before. They don't just want to sit in the living room on a couch and watch our product on a fixed screen on the wall with a remote control in their hand. They want to do it in many more ways, and they have the authority thanks to technology to make those decisions. So, we're starting with what we believe the consumer wants. Every one of those examples that you used, which sounds like a strategic initiative for the company...\nDavid Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Right.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: ...is actually a strategic initiative for the consumer. It's really that simple. And this is a company that has been consumer-facing from the start. And I think actually when you look at what we do at our parks, it's a great example of that. And all of these things that we're doing, we're trying to take a very, very expansive look at the consumer today and where that consumer is going, particularly the younger consumer. So second, as it relates to, well maybe in a strange way flexibility, all of these things are designed to obviously create product that we think ultimately benefits the shareholders of The Walt Disney Company, but also to learn from. And if we take product out that may work at a given time but long term have a negative impact on businesses or business models that can continue to create more value for us, then we'll retract and we'll cut back. We've got a lot of good things going for us. And in reality, the multichannel business model, while facing more competition than ever before, is still a huge driver of value for this company. What we ultimately would want to do would be to do whatever we can working with the distributors to make that product more compelling, more consumer-facing than it ever has been. That's really the biggest goal. As it relates to SVOD and those things, I think we could get to a point where off-network programs, both in-season and prior-season, are bundled with the channels that the programs were originally on, and that may be a feature that's offered to multi-channel subscribers that's designed as a means to perpetuate that business model or make that business model more consumer-friendly. So I'm not going to suggest that we're set in our ways or stuck in the business model of the future to the point where it damages the former business model in ways that either aren't necessary or that are premature.\nDavid Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks very much.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: David, thanks for the question. Operator, next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you, good afternoon. Christine, can you just update us on the currency calculations we should be thinking about or currency factors on the hedges that you laid out last quarter now that we're 90 days later, as we think about fiscal 2016? And sticking with fiscal 2016, I think it's a fairly clean year for domestic affiliate revenue growth. There are no big renewals and you've lapped SEC. So any help on modeling out domestic affiliate revenue growth in 2016 would be helpful too. Thank you.\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: Okay. Thanks, Ben. So let's talk about foreign exchange because we did give that information last quarter. As we mentioned at the time, we were fully hedged going into fiscal 2016, so that estimate that we gave you of about a $500 million impact year over year is still the right estimate looking forward to the year, so there's no change on that. And the impact for fiscal 2015, there was a modest negative impact from what was originally given, but that's only because some of our businesses outperformed. So once again, we were fully hedged based on the estimates as we're going into a fiscal year. On the cable affiliate growth, we updated our three-year affiliate guidance on the last earnings call and we don't intend to update it again. We also don't give annual guidance on affiliate revenue growth. But I will remind you that fiscal 2015 did benefit from the launch of the SEC Network, and that is something that we will be comping against in fiscal 2016.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Okay. Thanks, Ben. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi. Please go ahead.\nJason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Just a question for Mr. Iger. I think when the history books are written, they'll point to your tenure at Disney. Maybe the most important decision you made was reinvigorating the IP pipeline with Pixar and Marvel and Lucas. And my question is, how do you know or what is the right way to think about the limiting factor? In other words, how do you know if what you have is enough? Is it finding the right IP out in the marketplace, that's the constraint? Is it how much the organization can actually effectively monetize through all the divisions? Is it something else?\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I'm not 100% sure, Jason, whether you're talking about making more or buying more.\nJason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Either one. I'm glad you went through your film slate for 2016, and it's very broad-based. But I don't know. I just I can't...\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Let's start first of all with I'll call it making more of what we own already, meaning these great franchises and brands. You know that you're making too much when either your quality is going down or the marketplace is telling you that there's fatigue or they've had enough.\nJason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We don't see that in any of the products that we're making or that you cited. Pixar had one of its most successful releases ever with Inside Out and its most original this past year. And we're really excited about The Good Dinosaur. And of course, we have Finding Dory, the sequel to Nemo next year, as a for-instance. Marvel, obviously Avengers 2: Age of Ultron did extremely well, over $1.4 billion in global revenue, in global box office. And we've got Captain America 3: Civil War coming up this year and a pretty rich pipeline thereafter. Of both sequels, things like Thor and Captain America, as I mentioned, and Ant-Man but also original like Dr. Strange, for instance. We like that balance. Star Wars we're just getting into, obviously premature, but we're basically planning roughly a Star Wars release a year for the next six years. Three of them part of the saga; VII, VIII, and IX. Three will be standalone films. I think we've only announced two of those three, Rogue One being the first, which comes out in December of 2016. So we don't think we're oversaturated. If anything, we think that we're very, very well-balanced in terms of taking these products to market. In terms of products or franchises that we don't own, obviously not going to comment on that, except I can say that with Disney \u2013 which has also never been stronger, by the way. Just look at the Oscars that we've won for Frozen and Big Hero 6, the box office, the excitement about this movie Zootopia that's coming up, which I think is going to be a real sleeper hit and that's coming up in actually first quarter, end of the first calendar quarter rather, of 2016. I think with Disney and Pixar and Marvel and Lucas, Star Wars, we don't really have much of a need. Our pipeline is pretty rich, the richest ever for us.\nJason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Agreed.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: But, we'll be opportunistic. If we see something that we feel is as attractive as these others have been, that's leverageable across markets, across businesses, over long periods of time, which is what we really consider a franchise then we certainly have the capital structure to be able to take advantage of the opportunity.\nJason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Thanks, Jason. Operator, next question please?\nOperator: And our next question comes from David Miller from Topeka Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDavid W. Miller - Topeka Capital Markets: Hey, guys. Congratulations on the stellar results. Christine, just a housekeeping item for you. The park margins at 16.9%, just outstanding by any measure but not a record, and I believe they were down year-over-year although only 45 basis points or so. If you look at the previous three quarters, you had record margins at the parks. Was that just because of the pension and retirement costs that you cited in the press release, or was there something else going on there? Just curious. Thanks a lot.\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: Yes. Thank you, David. Yeah, the margins as you cited were down at 16.9%, that's actually 40 basis points not 45 basis points, but who's counting.\nDavid W. Miller - Topeka Capital Markets: Sorry about that.\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP: But they were primarily due to the performance of Hong Kong Disneyland and also some preopening expenses at Shanghai Disneyland. Domestically, talking about domestically, specifically, there were some year-over-year increases that impacted the margins, and one of those would have been the Magic Dry Dock, which is one of our cruise ships.\nDavid W. Miller - Topeka Capital Markets: Got it, okay. Thank you.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: All right. Thanks, David. Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Barton Crockett from FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBarton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets: Okay, great. Thanks for squeezing me in. What I'd like to follow-up on is that outlook for the declines in pay-TV subscriptions. So, on the last call, you acknowledge that there is a modicum of decline, whether it is 1% or 2%, something like that seems to be the industry numbers. But it would seem to me that that decline is unlikely to go on in perpetuity, that there is a sticking point. There is a group of people who won't \u2013 are not likely to cancel pay-TV because among other things they like sports, and they are avid sports fans. And you can't get that very easily outside of pay-TV, and other reasons, maybe economic reasons, are driving the cancellations. Have you guys done research that would suggest to you where these declines and subs might end? You know, if we're down 1% for a couple of years, does it stop then? What are your learnings telling you about where the sticking point is on declines?\nThomas O. Staggs - Chief Operating Officer: We're not going to make any predictions about what's going to exactly happen with the subs. At the end of the day, we talked about the subs in the terms that we've had, and generally what we're seeing is consistent with what we talked about last quarter. Having said that, as Bob indicated earlier, this market is going to continue to evolve and one of the things that we're going to see is that there's room for optimizing the bundle of programming that people receive. There are opportunities to increase the price-value relationship as well as the user experience of those, and as we indicated earlier, the program availability will likely be augmented over time. Bob talked about the possibility of in-season stacking being offered through the programming services that we offer. So, I think you're going to see the bundle continue to evolve, and I think you're going to see the industry, programmers and distributors alike respond to the consumer empowerment with increasingly strong product. And at the end of the day, we feel really good about the positioning of our major branded services; ESPN, Disney, ABC, to play a vital role in that optimization of the bundle. So, I think that this is going to play out over a long period of time. And for a very, very long period of time you're going to see that bundle be the primary means by which people get their programming.\nBarton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you, Barton, and thanks again, everyone, for joining us today.

My name is Joe and I will be the operator for your call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode and later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Lowell Singer. Mr. Singer, you may begin.\nLowell Singer: Good morning and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's third quarter 2015 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 45 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and a recording and the transcript of the call will be available on our website. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Staggs, Chief Operating Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob, Tom and Christine will each make some comments and then of course, we will be happy to take your questions. So with that, let me turn this call over to Bob and we can get started.\nBob Iger: Thanks, Lowell and good afternoon, everyone. Before we begin I'd like to welcome our new CFO, Christine McCarthy. Christine has done a great job as the company's Treasurer over the past 15 years. She's highly respected in the financial community and her strong leadership and keen financial acumen make her ideal for the role of CFO. I am sure you all have the opportunity to get to know her and you will be hearing from her a little later. Now turning to the quarter we are very pleased with our performance in Q3, with record net income and earnings per share. Diluted EPS increased 13% to $1.45 and revenue was up 5% to more than $13 billion, strong results across the board. Since our last earnings call we had the pleasure of unveiling the exciting details of Shanghai Disneyland and with a 60 history of relentless innovation, fantastic storytelling and extraordinary experiences we are creating a truly one-of-a-kind world-class destination. China Disneyland will have six theme lands featuring the best of what everyone knows and loves about Disney Parks, as well as a number of amazing original attractions created specifically for Shanghai resulting in an authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese Disneyland. I am happy to say that since we unveiled the details, the response in China has been tremendous with nearly 150 million people expressing their excitement on the country's top social media platforms. This investment represents one of the biggest creative endeavors undertaken by the company and with an opening plan for spring of 2016 we are truly excited by the potential in the world's most populous market. For those of you who haven't seen the great images and details of Shanghai Disneyland you can view them online at shanghaidisneyresort.com and I think you will be impressed. Before Tom takes you through the highlights of our businesses, I'd like to address an issue that has been receiving a fair amount of interest and attention these days and that's the rapidly changing media landscape especially as it relates to ESPN. We are realists about the business and about the impact technology has had on how product is distributed, marketed and consumed. We are also quite mindful of potential trends among younger audiences, in particular many of whom consume television in very different ways than the generations before them. Economics have also played a part in change and both cost and value are under a consumer microscope. All of this has and will continue to put pressure on the multichannel ecosystem, which has seen a decline in overall households as well as growth in so-called skinny or cable light packages. ESPN's experienced some modest sub losses although those have been less than reported by one of the prominent research firms and the vast majority of them, 80%, were due to decreases in multichannel households with only a small percentage due to skinny packages. Overall though we believe the expanded basic package will remain the dominant package of choice for some years to come, because to the quality and variety it represents for a price that is generally considered fair and appropriate. We also see the continued development of new platforms with smaller channel offerings, which we see as a positive trend for us, since ESPN is a must-have brand as part of the initial service offering for these new packages. Now we all know why this is, ESPN is the number one brand in sports media and one of the most valuable brands in all sports and among the most popular, respected and valuable brands in media, by consumers, advertisers and distributors. This is supported by the fact that in the first calendar quarter of this year alone, 83% of all multichannel households turn to ESPN at some point. ESPN is the most significant collection of sports program packages in the industry, and as license agreements for these sports typically run into the next decade, including the NFL, the NBA and Major League Baseball. It's coverage of college sports is unparalleled, particularly football and basketball and the first year of the college football playoff and national championship was an enormous success. ESPN's rights to this fantastic package have 11 years to run. Now we all know how valuable live programming has become and ESPN is the leader in live programming. 96% of all sports programming is watched live and this is particularly valuable in today's rapidly changing advertising marketplace. This year's Upfront provided ample proof. ESPN enjoyed both increased demand and sell-through rates as well as pricing increases. ESPN's embraced technology better than anyone in traditional media reaching its fans and engaging with them in more meaningful ways online and on mobile devices with its linear channels as well as with an array of additional programming, sports information, commentary conversation and very rich social media features. All of this adds up to a very strong hand and gives us enormous confidence in ESPN's future no matter how technology disrupts the media business. Now I will turn it over to Tom to take you through the highlights across the rest of our businesses. Tom?\nTom Staggs: Thanks, Bob and good afternoon, everyone. The core part of our strategy and a key source of sustained advantage for Disney is developing and leveraging our powerful brand and franchises across our many lines of business and distribution channels. Our investments in Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm underscore and dramatically enhance that advantage. Benefit of our strategy is evident in this quarter's results as our branded content led the healthy increases in operating income with our Parks and Resorts, Studio Entertainment and Consumer Products segment. Parks and Resorts had their highest quarter ever in Q3, in terms of both revenue and operating income. We have seen remarkable excitement for Disneyland's 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebrations which features a new fireworks show, an electrifying nighttime parade and a re-imagined world of colors spectacular, resulting in the highest attendance and profit for any quarter in the resort's history. At Walt Disney World attendance hit a record level for Q3, while also delivering the highest profit for any previous quarter for that location. The Studio continues execute extremely well in our branded tentpole strategy by delivering high-quality, immensely creative and broadly appealing theatrical entertainment. Three of the top six films in the U.S. this year are from Disney; Cinderella, Marvel's Avengers - Age of Ultron and Disney Pixar's Inside Out and all three has helped drive our strong results in the quarter. Inside Out has grossed $330 million in the U.S. and more than $600 million worldwide with more overseas markets yet to open. Avengers - Age of Ultron is now the six highest grossing film of all time with $1.4 billion at the box office. Ant-Man the newest character to join the Marvel cinematic universe spent its first two weekends at number one and has already grossed nearly $300 million worldwide with multiple overseas markets yet to open. And we are extremely pleased with another great original Disney Pixar film the Good Dinosaur coming this Thanksgiving. Of course we are all counting the days till December 18, when Star Wars - The Force Awakens makes its much-anticipated debut. That's just about a 135 days and 10 hours from now in case you are wondering. To give you a sense of the excitement for this film, a single Star Wars panel at Comic-Con this year drove 1.6 billion social and editorial impressions. Following The Force Awakens we release the first standalone Star Wars film Rogue One which is currently in production and will release December 16, 2016. It will be followed by Episode 8 - Star Wars Saga in May of 2017. It will come back in 2018 with a standalone film about young Hans Solo and then Episode 9 will hit theaters in 2019. And that's just the theatrical line up. On August 30th we will launch the Star Wars themed Disney Infinity 3.0 edition followed by an unprecedented consumer products global event called Force Friday on September 4. Stores around the world will open their doors at 12:01 AM to unveil an amazing array of merchandise inspired by Star Wars - The Force Awakens. Of course Star Wars is already a strong contributor among our broad array of powerful franchises for our Consumer Products business where profits were up substantially in the quarter led by the collective strength of Frozen, Avengers and Star Wars. Our Cable Networks benefited from strong visual programming at the Disney Channels and ABC Family which both contributed nicely to cable operating income growth in the quarter. In broadcasting ABC was the only TV network with year on year primetime ratings growth this past season thanks to the success of our lineup of Attorney and net hit shows including Scandal, How To Get Away With Murder, Black-ish and Fresh Off The Boat. ABC also received the most Emmy nominations of any broadcast networks this year, 42 in all, including 10 for the critically acclaimed series American Crime. Looking ahead we are optimistic about ABC's fall lineup which advertisers have responded by agreeing with ABC's industry-leading pricing gains in our just completed Upfront. As Bob said we are pleased with our results in Q3. We remain confident of our ability to create significant value for our shareholders. We have a lot to look forward to across all of our businesses in both the near term and the years ahead. With that I am extremely pleased to welcome Christine to her new role and turn the call over to her to take you through additional details for the quarter.\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks, Tom and good afternoon, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here on my first earnings call and I look forward to working with many of you more closely in the near future. With three quarters of the fiscal year behind us, we are very pleased with how the year is progressing. Third quarter earnings per share increased 13% to a record $1.45 driven by strength across our businesses. At Media Networks growth in operating income was due to higher results at Cable partially offset by lower results at broadcasting. Cable operating income was higher in the third quarter due to growth at Disney Channel, ABC Family and ESPN. Disney Channel and ABC Family results benefitted from programs sales and higher affiliate revenue, while growth at ESPN was driven by higher affiliate revenue partially offset by a 3% decline in advertising revenue. The decrease in ad revenue at ESPN was due to a difficult comparison with the Men's World Cup in Q3 last year, which more than offset the benefit of an additional game of the NBA Finals in Q3 this year. We estimate that ESPN's ad revenue was up a little over 5% when you exclude the impact of these events. So far this quarter ESPN ad sales are pacing up compared to prior year. Programming and production costs at cable were relatively flat in the quarter consistent with our expectations and we still expect these costs to be up low teen percentage points for the full year. Domestic cable affiliate revenue was up mid single-digits in the quarter as a result of contractual rate increases and the addition of the SEC Network which launched in August of last year. These increases were partially offset by lower deferred revenue recognitions at ESPN. If you recall, ESPN recognized $176 million in previously deferred revenue during Q3 last year and there was no deferred revenue recognized in the third quarter this year. Excluding the effect of the deferred revenue recognition last year, domestic cable affiliate revenue was up 12%. Broadcasting operating income was lower in the third quarter as higher programming costs and lower advertising revenue more than offset increases in affiliate revenue and higher program sales. The growth in affiliate revenue was due to new contracts and higher contractual rates. Program sales were up in the quarter driven by the sale of a number of shows, including Grey's Anatomy, America's Funniest Home Videos and Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was down low single-digits, as lower news and daytime ratings were partially offset by higher rates. Quarter to date scatter pricing at the network is pacing modestly above Upfront levels. At Parks and Resorts growth in operating income was driven by higher results at our domestic operations which saw gains in both attendance and guest spending, partially offset by lower results at our international operations. Margins were up 100 basis points to over 22%. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 4% and per capita spending was up 2% in the third quarter due to increased spending on food and beverage and merchandise. Occupancy at our domestic resorts was up 5 percentage points to 87% and program spending was up 4%. So far this quarter domestic resorts reservations excluding the 53rd week are pacing up 4% compared to prior year levels, while book trades are up 6%. International operations were lower in the third quarter due to a decline in attendance and occupied room nights at Hong Kong Disneyland and higher preopening spending at Shanghai Disney Resort. Results at Disneyland Paris were comparable to prior year. The weakness of the euro compared to prior year resulted in about $100 million average impact to Disneyland Paris' revenue. However there was a corresponding benefit to expenses of roughly the same amount. At Studio Entertainment, we delivered another strong quarter with operating income up 15% over prior year driven by increases in theatrical distributions reflecting the strong performance of Avengers - Age of Ultron, Cinderella and Inside Out, partially offset by the performance of Tomorrowland. Studio results also benefited from higher revenue share from Consumer Products and growth in international television distribution. Home entertainment results were lower in the quarter as a result of a difficult comparison with the performance of Frozen in the prior year. Our Consumer Products business continues to benefit from the depth and breadth of our licensing portfolio. Segment operating income was up 27% on revenue growth at 6% and margins were up over 600 basis points. Growth in operating income in the quarter was due to higher results in merchandise licensing which was driven by Frozen, the Avengers and Star Wars. On a comparable basis earned licensing revenue in the third quarter was up 20% over last year. At Interactive results reflected lower performance of Disney Infinity partially offset by higher results from our mobile games business. We feel great about our third quarter results and with the end of fiscal 2015 less than two months away, I now want to take a moment to give you an early look into fiscal 2016. As we look ahead to 2016 there are two items I want to address. First, the strength of the U.S. dollar versus a number of key foreign currencies is expected to adversely impact our operating income in 2016 by approximately $500 million. Second, in April of last year we told you that we expected to grow both domestic cable affiliate revenue and cable operating income by high single-digits on a compounded annual basis between fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2016. Due to the lower subscriber levels, Bob discussed earlier, we now expect domestic cable affiliate revenue to fall a bit short of our previous expectations though still in the high single-digit range. We now expect this lower affiliate revenue and the multiyear impact of foreign exchange rates to moderate our cable operating income growth to mid single-digits during the fiscal 2013 to 2016 period. We are disciplined in our capital allocation strategy and continue to take a balanced approach between investing in existing businesses, making strategic acquisitions and returning capital to shareholders. Our financial results over the past several years including the record quarter we just reported are evidence our capital allocation strategy has delivered and continues to deliver tangible results. Returning capital to our shareholders continues to be a key component of our capital allocation strategy. Last month the Board declared a dividend of $0.66 for the first half of this fiscal year, which represents an increase of 15% on an annualized basis. Going forward we expect to pay dividends on a semi-annual basis. During the third quarter we repurchased 9.4 million shares for $1 billion. Fiscal year to date we have repurchased 32.4 million shares for $3.2 billion which coupled with $3.1 billion in dividends paid this year represents approximately $6.3 billion in capital returned to our shareholders so far in fiscal 2015. And given our outlook for next year we currently expect to increase our level of share repurchase to between $6 billion and $8 billion in fiscal 2016. Before I turn the call back over to Lowell for Q&A, I want to take a moment to say how honored I am to be the CFO of this company. And I look forward to continue working with so many great colleagues here at Disney as well as many of you in the near future.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Christine. Joe we are ready for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question here comes from Mr. Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. I have one for Christine and one for Bob. Christine following up on the guidance you just gave on foreign exchange, could you talk a bit about how Disney hedges and why are we seeing more foreign exchange impact in this fiscal year given movement in dollar a year ago versus being felt in '16? So talk a bit about the timing of that [impact].\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. Thank you, Michael, that's a great question. The way we hedge foreign exchange is on a multiyear basis. So it does have the benefit of mitigating the full impact of changes in currency rates on operating income. So let me just give you some perspective which I think will explain the year over year change. Back in the summer of 2014 when the U.S. dollar started strengthening we were mostly hedged for fiscal '15. With the continued dollar strength that we saw in this current year 2015, as we layered into additional hedges for fiscal '16 they were at less favorable rates. Hence the year-over-year '15 to '16 impact is currently estimated to be around that $500 million.\nMichael Nathanson: Okay. Thanks. And Bob something you said in the beginning. It's a question that I know all of us get and Lowell gets too. It's about the right number of subscriber losses at ESPN. And all us track Nielsen. You put it in your 10-K in terms of the yearly change in ESPN subscribers. What's the right level of subscriber growth? And when you think about your current guidance, what is the right level of future near-term subscriber losses, do you think, for ESPN, maybe for the big basic bundle in total?\nBob Iger: Well first of all Michael we report in our filings Nielsen's numbers, but they don't necessarily track the number of subs that we get paid on and in fact the numbers that have recently been in the press which are Nielsen numbers were higher in terms of sub losses than those that we are seeing. But we're not at this point ready to give specifics in terms of what those numbers are. That answer that question?\nMichael Nathanson: Okay and the 10-K.\nBob Iger: That's impartially.\nMichael Nathanson: Okay. And then your changing guidance is because have you taken a more conservative view over next year in subscriber or subscriber revenue or is it based on where you were?\nBob Iger: On the revenue side Christine said we are sticking to the high single-digits. On the O/I side the combination of slightly less subscribers than we predicted at the time with foreign exchange rate changes leads to us taking the O/I guidance down from the high single-digits to the mid single-digits. But on the revenue side we are maintaining the high single-digit outlook.\nMichael Nathanson: Okay. Thanks, Bob.\nLowell Singer: Okay, Michael thank you. Operator next question please.\nOperator: Of course our next question here comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. I guess Bob just sort of staying on that same topic about the outlook for ESPN and subs how do you balance sort of maintaining the current ecosystem and help them sustain, traditional subs with sort of new opportunities that are over-the-top can present themselves? I guess ultimately on that same point, as over-the-top platforms expand do you think it's just a share shift from linear TV or do you think it actually can expand the reach of the market for ESPN?\nBob Iger: Well I think you can look at this many different ways. One, you can look at it in terms of the overall television landscape and the linear MVPD expanded basic business versus the growth in so-called over-the-top businesses or you can look at specifically with regard to ESPN. I guess I will take the broader sort of market look first. First of all I think while there has been a lot said about what's going on in the multichannel universe and as I said in my comments, it's still the dominant form of television viewing and it is the dominant form clearly for sports viewing as well. And we mentioned 83% -- statistic 83% of all U.S. households watched ESPN, U.S. multichannel households watched ESPN in the first quarter. So you are still looking at a significant amount of consumption through the multichannel universe. We also look at that business and we look at it as a consumer offering and we see huge variety of programming, a lot of live or kind of topical programming that's on, meaning you don't have to wait a year to watch library as a for instance. I mentioned significant amount of variety and quality obviously for prices generally considered reasonable and the price is often bundled with broadband and in some cases with telephony. So when we look at the universe we don't really see dramatic declines over the next say five years or so and therefore we are not taking what I would call radical steps to move our products into over-the-top businesses to disrupt that business because we don\u2019t think right now that is necessarily the greatest opportunity. We just don\u2019t think it's necessary. That said there are new platforms that are launching, some multichannel and some other types of platforms that on the multichannel front they all want our programming. They want ABC, they want Disney Channel, they want ESPN. There isn't one that has talked about launching without coming to us, suggesting a desire to have us. We are going to obviously because we believe that's in our best interest, we are going to take advantage of those opportunities and at the right price under the right circumstances, license our linear channels to those platforms. In addition to that you have the growth of platforms like Netflix or SVOD, that's interesting as well because, while one could argue that for all the right reasons that's starting to incentivize or maybe incentivizing people including millennials to cord cut, it's also providing us opportunities because the Netflix has become a really important partner to us in buying our off-network product, buying original programming for us, the Marvel deal is a good example. And then our film library kicks in the output deal for the '16 slate kicks in. So we look at Netflix actually right now as more friend than foe because they have become an aggressive customer of ours. I also think that products like Netflix are pretty attractive because they offer a very user-friendly, efficient and oftentimes much less expensive way for people to watch television. I am going to say one more thing, I realize I am getting wordy, but the average American is watching about 5.5 hours of TV a day and we see that going up to about 6 hours. The reason they're watching 5.5 hours of TV a day is because of just what I just described as huge value in the multichannel product for customers and its popular and the reason we believe it's going to increase from 5.5 hours to 6 hours is because of the advent of new technology driven platforms, whether they are over-the-top, whether it's SVOD, whether it's new smaller services. So it's a long over that way around my saying that we actually believe that with Disney, ABC, ESPN, our products we are really well-positioned. We've been among the first if not the first to offer our products on new platforms even if it's somewhat disruptive, we still believe in the expanded basic service for years to come but we are going to take advantage of opportunities. It's just hard to say when something either feels too disruptive too fast or not but when we see it, we will tell you about it.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer: Thank you, Alexia. Operator next question please.\nOperator: Of course. Our next question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead sir.\nTodd Juenger: Guess what I want to talk about, too? Just the multichannel universe and PayTV subscribers. Let me take a shot at this and see what you're willing to engage in. I'd love to hear, as you construct your traditional distribution arrangements, especially for ESPN but your general Cable Networks, would you be willing to talk about what type of protections or options you generally might look for in the case that subscriber losses accelerate or are more than you expected? Are there minimums? Are there pricing resets? Are there opportunities to protect yourself? I'm sure there are on the downside. We'd love to hear those.\nBob Iger: Todd we cannot get specific about it. I can tell you that our distribution agreements do address the number of subs that are being delivered or that were being paid for and there are facets of those agreements that enable us to amend the business relationship or the contractual relationship that we have with these distributors should subs go below a certain number. When I say amend I am not going to get specific about how we would go about that or what the specific mechanisms are in the contracts for that because frankly its confidential. Since you I guess asked a little bit about maybe the future and new deals, I can only say and you know a lot of these deals run for multiple years, but I can only say that when we enter new deals we will probably take an even longer term view about what threats and what opportunities exist for us in the marketplace. So that we are both protective against the threats and we are given full opportunity to take advantage of changes in the marketplace that could strengthen our business alike going direct to consumers should we conclude that that becomes the more attractive alternative to us.\nTodd Juenger: Fair enough. And then one follow-up, if you don't mind. I'll make it quick. Somebody has got to ask -- just anything that you care to say about the status of your relations with Verizon and what's going on there? Thanks.\nBob Iger: No. Not commenting on that except to say that we have got ongoing discussions with them. I think they clearly recognize that the channels and the product that we offer have great value to them in their current services and the new services that they are contemplating launching.\nTodd Juenger: All right. Then thank you.\nLowell Singer: Thank you, Todd. Operator next question please.\nOperator: Of course. Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from BofA. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Cohen: It's BAML, but okay. I have two topics. One is film and one is theme parks. And then just some couple of small questions. On film, can you clarify it was -- any shortfall in Tomorrowland's fully in the third fiscal quarter? And Bob just following up on the comments you made about television viewing and your view that viewing will actually go up because there's more ways to see including Netflix, do you have a point of view on films? Like both film distribution change or film viewing change because of technology? And then I guess I will come back with the theme park questions.\nTom Staggs: Well just very briefly, Jessica this is Tom. On Tomorrowland, we did see an impact of Tomorrowland in the quarter. Obviously that was more than offset by the success of the other titles. But yes, the underperformance there did show up.\nBob Iger: On the motion picture side we see global motion picture consumption actually growing. A lot of that is obviously due to the number one growth market in the world in terms of grosses and that's China where we have seen just massive increase in movie-going over the last two to three years. I know a lot's been said about the window and weather technology and the opportunity to view under higher-quality circumstances in the home is going to compress the theatrical window. For the kind of movies that we make which are largely what I will call tent-pole films, we actually believe the theatrical window is incredibly important to us and at the moment we don't really see any need to aggressively compress it. We time our -- call it this the home video product that goes into the marketplace very carefully, mostly the track, the retail opportunities that we have as a company, retail opportunities to both sell the movie into that window and retail opportunities to take advantage of the Consumer Products sales that we generally get at retail from a lot of the movies that we make. So we think that generally motion picture consumption is increasing in the world, it's been relatively flat in the United States by the way I don\u2019t think that's going to change and for at least us we don\u2019t really see taking steps to decrease the most -- the theatrical window because frankly its working for us.\nJessica Reif Cohen: And then on theme parks, just a couple of really quick ones. But you mentioned the currency and exchange impact you expect in fiscal '16 overall. But is there any -- are you seeing an impact from international visitors, with stronger dollar in international visitors? Second, the 60th anniversary -- is there any way you could frame the impact of that for Disneyland? And then finally -- sorry about that, but finally there has been speculation that you guys have gotten approval. I think you've gotten some approvals in California. So there's speculation that you are building a new land. Do you have any comment on Star Wars land or something like that?\nTom Staggs: Okay, Jessica its Tom. First of all on the foreign exchange Christine talked about that overall impact for next year, but in terms of looking at international attendance right now, the overall we haven't seen dramatic impact on the currency rate in terms of the total attendance. Now if we look at the correlation with where the economies around the world are weakest we also see that in the attendance. So for example, the U.K. was relatively strong this past quarter, while Brazil was a bit lower and so that economic status coupled probably with some changes in exchange rates does have an impact. But if you look at international attendance for Q3 as an example, now Q3 by the way is a perennially lower of the quarters in terms of international attendance percentage wise. It was in the range that we normally experience. So we don\u2019t discern it has a very big impact there. With regard to the 60th there is no question that people have responded well to the 60th and there is obviously a lot of attachment to Disneyland and that has led to what we talked about which is the best quarter ever at Disneyland Resort in terms of attendance and profitability. And so I would say that the 60th is one of the key drivers there but as well as the new content and product that we put in around the 60th to drive it. So Disneyland we expect to continue to do well going forward. And then with regard to Star Wars, as we have said we are excited about Star Wars across the company and parks is no exception. So I would say stay tuned for more specifics about our plans there.\nJessica Reif Cohen: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Thank you, Jessica. Operator next question please.\nOperator: Our next question here comes from David Bank from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDavid Bank: Thank you very much. I will not ask about ESPN and the evolving ecosystem. You guys have two incredibly seminal events that are going to occur over the next 12 months, in the re-launch of Star Wars and the opening of Shanghai. And we are really close to the eve of those events at this point. And I think, for many of us, I know the questions I get, we still have a pretty hard time putting our arms around the incremental income statement impact from those two incredibly seminal events in '16 and beyond. And so, I guess I'm hoping for a little more color as we sit on the eve. I think we have a framework for the box office. But is there any sense of sort of incremental order of magnitude you could talk to us about, aside from the Force Friday impact on Consumer Products? Like what is the order of magnitude on the income statement? And for Shanghai, can you give us kind of a basic sense of impact on that first 12 months? Is it kind of breakeven? Is it earnings drag? Is it earnings lift? Any incremental color on those two events in the income statement would be really, really helpful.\nBob Iger: On the Star Wars front David, we know that there is just incredible interest in this film. We have put two teaser trailers out and the response has been enormous. Anything that moves gets a lot of attention and anticipation is obviously huge and we've seen some examples already of Star Wars product going to the marketplace on the Consumer Products front including in markets like China that are very, very encouraging. That said as enthusiastic as we are for what we know of the film, we've not seen a Star Wars film than the original one since 2005 and there are markets around the world that are less familiar with Star Wars than say the United States for instance. So while the enthusiasm is I think rather apparent we just want to be careful that the world doesn\u2019t get ahead of us too much in terms of the estimates and we've seen them as well. We are making at this point no estimates whatsoever in terms of what we believe the film will do. We know we have probably the most viable film franchise that ever existed. We know we have the ability as a company to leverage it in very, very compelling ways whether it's in Disney Infinity, whether it's at Parks Tim sited, whether it's on the Consumer Products front or on the TV front. And we fully expect that the success of this film will reverberate throughout the company not only in 2016 but in the years beyond because we obviously have a rich slate of Star Wars films coming. So we just want to be careful here that the market doesn\u2019t get too far ahead of us or ahead of itself even on this. Let's all continue to anticipate the movie and be optimistic about it, but we have to take a wait-and-see approach in terms of what it will do. On the Shanghai front I am going to let Tom talk about the economic impacts in '16. But you know there to like Star Wars in many ways there is huge anticipation. And as I mentioned in my comments the reaction to what we revealed a couple of weeks ago in Shanghai was extraordinary not just in terms of the level of interest, but the level of enthusiasm. And the positive reaction to the fact that we are building a Park that was of such scale and was so unique in many ways particularly in a blend of what I call traditional Disney Theme Park experiences and a lot of things that are both original and very, very specifically tailored for the Chinese market.\nTom Staggs: And I think the real headline for 2016 and as we get closer to the opening we will do more to help you understand how to look down the road with Shanghai. But for right now this is really about the preopening expenses. So in 2014 we started to incur some opening expenses of size that were noticeable. That number of course has gone up in 2015 which is part of what you see in the International Theme Park results and then that will ramp even further in 2016. You should anticipate that roughly half of the total preopening expenses for the project we will see in 2016. And so the net result of that is Shanghai won't contribute to profitability in 2016 based on our best assumption right now, but then in future years you'll see the real impact and the financial returns which we continue to believe will be quite attractive.\nDavid Bank: Terrific. Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, David. Operator next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Please go ahead.\nAnthony DiClemente: Thanks a lot. I have two questions, one for Christine and one for Bob. Christine, just given the clarification to the ESPN guidance, I wanted to just follow up on that. Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself, but as we look even further beyond that guidance window, you don't have any big sports right step ups in fiscal 2016. But in first quarter 2017 you have the NBA rights fee step up, which is a big step up. So what are the things that you are doing or plan to do in order to make room for that in the budget at ESPN for the increase in the NBA rights fee at that time? And then secondly, for Bob, you talked about China. We were talking about Shanghai and the park. I wanted to just talk about the media market or get your thoughts. The theatrical market -- obviously huge and massively growing. Your release slate will presumably help you with share gain there. But what about the home entertainment market? You recently partnered with Youku for exclusive local marketing of Marvel films. I know there's a lot of piracy there but also presumably a massive opportunity. What is the strategy for home video distribution in China? Thanks.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. Anthony your question about ESPN, the new NBA deal will occur in 2017 and we still believe that ESPN has plenty of room for growth.\nBob Iger: On the question about China, the announcement that was made about a deal with Youku I think you mentioned was not correct. We have not entered into a partnership arrangement with them. The home-video market in China is obviously challenged by the fact that it's a market that's been you know rife with piracy and so a legitimate home-video market never quite developed there. There are a number of new platforms that have launched or that are expected to launch and we are in a number of conversations none that we can discuss because we are not ready to announce it with some of them about output deals for our films. And we feel good about essentially digital delivery of these films into a window that's likely to be lucrative for us over a long period of time. And essentially enable us to put legitimate products into the marketplace swiftly to hopefully counter what we've encountered in a lot of Asian markets which is piracy.\nAnthony DiClemente: Thanks a lot.\nLowell Singer: Okay, Anthony, thanks. Operator next question please.\nOperator: Of course. Our next question here comes from Doug Mitchelson from UBS. Please go ahead.\nDoug Mitchelson: Let me add my welcome to Christine. Bob, I think we've gotten what we can from you on ESPN. So I'm going to turn to Tom and Christine. Tom, I just wanted to make sure you could give us a sense about the benefits the domestic park investment cycle, MyMagic+, in particular, relative to the 2% per cap rate for the quarter. Was that just a tough comp? Or are we starting to see any kind of wind-down in the benefits of prior investments at the U.S. Parks? And for Christine, the comment on the $500 million of FX and the fact that you hedge over a multiyear period suggest there could be some lag in fiscal 2017 or beyond, above the $500 million relative to the current interest rate levels. Is that right? Is there further impact if you mark to market everything to current exchange rates? And lastly and I guess also for Christine, maybe I'd missed it. But the moderating EBIT growth for Cable Networks from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2016, is some of that currency as well as the subscriber growth that we have all been talking about? Or is it just ESPN subscriber growth?\nTom Staggs: So Doug, let me start with the first question. The Parks per cap the growth of 2% that you saw, the real driver there really was the attendance mix where we saw very strong demand at the local level, and especially in the annual pass and that then shows up on the attendance per cap. Food and beverage and merchandise were in line with what we've been seeing prior quarters. So that really is guest mix. But the major initiatives -- we continue to be very pleased with them broadly and with MyMagic+ in particular. This has been broadly available for about a year now. In fact we had about 13 million folks use the MagicBands and they have overwhelmingly called it an excellent experience. So we are very pleased there. We intend to return all of those metrics that we look are pointed in the right direction and MyMagic+ actually was a contributor to the results positively in the quarter. And then also you continue to see the strength of things like the relaunch of California Adventure driving the games at Disneyland. So we feel very good about both that set of initiatives and their continued ability to drive our results.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks Tom.\nChristine McCarthy: Doug, on the $500 million that's another good question regarding foreign exchange. It's not the simplest subject. But if we had not hedged at all, the FX impact would have been more significant in fiscal '15. But the reason I say that is we don't know what rates are going to do in '16. But right now for fiscal '16 we are expecting that $500 million adverse impact. And the hedge ratios that we have in place are actually more favorable than current levels. So if there were changes in different directions during the year we would continue layering in during '16 for '17. But right now the hedges that we have in place for '17 albeit more modest than where we are for '16, they are with -- right now they look like they would benefit us in a strong dollar market. ESPN in particular, you know the FX issue there is separate and distinct from the $500 million that we talked about. The foreign exchange impact for ESPN is over that three-year period and when we talked back in 2014 at the Investor Day for that outlook, right at that point in time the U.S. dollar had not started its significant strengthening. That was in the summer of '14. So during that period the dollar has significantly strengthened across a number of key currencies for our cable nets, including the yen, euro, the pound as well as the Brazilian real. So that FX impact is part of that outlook guidance that we gave.\nDoug Mitchelson: Okay. And just to be clear, the lowering from the high single digit to mid-single digit was a mix of currency and domestic subscribers or just domestic subscribers shortfalls?\nChristine McCarthy: It's a combination -- it's the -- it's both the adverse impact of lower expected sub levels and the adverse impact of the stronger dollar.\nDoug Mitchelson: Okay. Great. And there's no way you can give us the breakdown of those two, by chance?\nChristine McCarthy: No. I think just the way it was explained is what we can do.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thank you so much.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks, Doug. Operator next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne: I have questions for Bob and then for Christine. First, Bob, you have been very vocal about the shift of advertising from TV to digital. Can you just help us think about how you think about ESPN, ABC ad sales going forward? Do you expect those businesses to grow over time? And do you expect the industry to grow when you look out over sort of a multiyear forecast?\nBob Iger: We're seeing real growth but it is still relatively small in terms of total dollars versus what we see on the traditional platforms. In ESPN's case as we have said before they package their ad sales across all of their platforms. They are basically their linear more analog platforms as well as all their digital platforms and platforms like radio and even their magazine. But we think that there is going to be tremendous growth from a percentage basis of digital and we're going to continue to work with advertisers and with the research firms that are out there to work to not only get more creative but to provide more details, essentially more consumption research, so that we can grow the business even more. The demand is clearly there. What you see in the advertising community not only have you seen much more opportunity for local addressable advertising but you see a huge demand from the advertising community as well. By the way while we are on the subject of ESPN because we have been on it a lot, so why not. I want to make one other point about it. First of all we have said a number of times, you think ESPN, you have to think about the NFL, the NBA, Major League Baseball, the best package available on College Football, College Football Championships, College Basketball, events like Wimbledon and U.S. Open et cetera. The other thing you have to consider is that in many of these cases we are only at the beginning or in some cases not even at the beginning like the NBA of new deals to kick in. Those new deals all provide for more programming, more opportunity for content on digital platforms, which will enable us to increase consumption on digital platforms and grow that business even more and generally more flexibility in terms of how we distribute this product. So the NBA's a great example. You can have a huge increase in essentially inventory on ESPN across its platforms. So while there is definitely increasing costs, there is a huge increase in terms of opportunity as well to reach more people, to serve advertisers more effectively and to grow our digital platforms.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you. Christine, just on the 53rd week, any way to think about the impact, the benefit in Q4? You mentioned ESPN was pacing up in the quarter. I didn't know if that was both including and excluding the 53rd week impact. And then any way to think about the 53rd week impact in '16, when you are going to comp the 2015 benefit?\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks, Ben. You can think about the 53rd week in terms of it being an additional week of operations. So it's relatively proportional in the year. So would be a benefit here in fiscal '15 and it would have the reverse effect in fiscal '16.\nBen Swinburne: Okay. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks, Ben. Operator we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Your last question here comes from Spencer Hill -- I am sorry, our next question here comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi. Please go ahead.\nJason Bazinet: Maybe quick question for Ms. McCarthy. Regarding leverage, the gross leverage has come down very gradually over the last decade to below one time. The cost of debt is quite low, obviously, in the markets. Your ROICs, even if I include goodwill in all divisions, seems to be in the low double-digit range. So why is this the right level of leverage for a firm like yours?\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks, Jason. You are absolutely correct, our leverage has reduced as the company has continued to perform. We generate cash flow that we deploy to returning to shareholders as well as investing in businesses, doing strategic acquisitions. So when we look at our leverage, the number that you quote is actually a gross number and we do look at our leverage in terms of the way the rating agencies look at it, so they will make some adjustments to that for things like pension obligations. So that's a little bit higher from a rating agency perspective. That being said we do enjoy a Mid Single A credit rating. We also are Tier 1 commercial paper issuer. So as it currently stands we feel like we are returning capital to shareholders as well as investing in businesses, doing acquisitions and at the same time we are maintaining financial strength and flexibility.\nJason Bazinet: Okay. Thank you very much.\nA - Lowell Singer: Thank you, Jason. And thanks again everyone for joining us today.

My name is Vivian and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nLowell Singer: Good morning and welcome to The Walt Disney company second-quarter 2015 earnings call. Our press release was issued earlier this morning and it's available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and we will later post the webcast and a transcript on our website. Joining me in Burbank for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Staggs, Disney's Chief Operating Officer; and Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob, Tom and Jay will each make some comments and then of course, we will be happy to take your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob and we can get started.\nBob Iger: Thanks, Lowell. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. We appreciate your flexibility and your understanding. We're very pleased with our performance in Q2 with adjusted EPS of $1.23, up 11% over the prior year. Our results once again reflect the strength of our brands and the quality of our content. These key elements are evident in the phenomenal opening of Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron. Released in about 70% of international market so far, the movie opened number one in every single market. And in the process, broke a number of box office records. As of this morning, the movie has surpassed $650 million in global box office which speaks to the popularity of these characters and the enduring connection that millions of people have with them. In fact, the three top movies with the highest-grossing opening weekends of all time, Marvel's Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron and Iron Man 3. Of course, when it comes to franchises that inspire tremendous fan devotion, Star Wars certainly sets the standard. We unveiled the second teaser trailer for Star Wars: The Force Awakens a couple of weeks ago and the reaction was unprecedented. The excitement around this movie is unlike anything we've ever seen before. The new trailer had more than 88 million views in the first 24 hours and now has more than 200 million views to date. So that gives you some sense of the tremendous interest and excitement around this film which should only intensify as we get closer to the December 18 release date. We're also looking forward to the grand opening of Shanghai Disney Resort which is just about a year away. We've been very selective about sharing specifics so far, but this summer, we'll unveil a number of details that will give everyone a true sense of how spectacular this authentically Disney, distinctly Chinese destination will be. And I'm looking forward to seeing our progress when Tom and I go back to Shanghai in just a few weeks. Speaking of Tom, this is our first earnings call since he was named Chief Operating Officer. Before Jay covers the financial details, I'd like to ask him to take you through some of the highlights across our businesses. Tom?\nTom Staggs: Thanks, Bob and good morning, everyone. It's great to be back in an earnings call with all of you. With my move back to a corporate role, we're pleased to have Bob Chapek running parks and resorts. He's been working his way around the world to get an in-depth understanding of the business and he is off to a great start to continue his strong performance. Later this month, he'll help us officially kick off the celebration of Disneyland's 50th anniversary, the park that started it all and we plan to mark this historic milestone in true Disney style, including a fantastic new parade, a new World of Color show and a new Firework Spectacular, among other features. Looking ahead, we have plenty of reason for excitement across the entire company, starting with an incomparable slate of upcoming movies. In addition to the ones Bob mentioned, we also have Disney's Tomorrowland, starring George Clooney, in theaters later this month. Paul Rudd takes on the role of Marvel's Ant-Man in July. We're also thrilled to have two new Pixar movies coming to theaters this year. Inside Out opens on June 19 and it's already generating a lot of well-deserved buzz and excitement. And we're looking forward to even more great Pixar storytelling, when The Good Dinosaur opens at Thanksgiving. Our media networks group is home to some of the strongest brands and content in the business which consistently drives demand and value in the market. ESPN continues to invest in extraordinary programming and innovation to super serve sports fans. In Q2, this unparalleled sports coverage drove double-digit audience growth on ESPN and ESPN2. And the total average audience across ESPN's compelling suite of sports networks was up 9% for the quarter. On the broadcast side, ABC has 7 of the top 20 series this season, including 3 of the top 5 dramas. It is also achieved greater growth in the key primetime audience of adults 18 to 49 than any other major network. In a recent survey, media buyers and planners identified ABC as the network having the most impressive year, a good sign as the network kicks off the upfront sales season next week. We're also extremely pleased with the instant success of Daredevil, the first of four live-action series produced for Netflix by Marvel Television and ABC Studios which further demonstrates the power, breadth and value of the Marvel Universe. Just 2 weeks after the first 13 episodes launched great acclaim and strong demand, Netflix ordered a second season. This initial success bodes well for the three other upcoming serialized programs on Netflix. Marvel's Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage, as well as the planned miniseries event uniting all these characters into a shared story line. Our consumer-products business also had a great quarter, driven by the continued popularity of our strong franchises, especially Frozen and Avengers. Retail sales for Frozen merchandise so far this year are more than 10 times higher than the same period last year. And sales of new merchandise for Avengers: Age of Ultron indicates a strong global demand. We expect the release of The Force Awakens to accelerate growth of the Star Wars franchise. As we just announced, we're planning a global event on September 4 to launch new merchandise inspired by the upcoming movie with retailers around the world and online kicking off sales of the new line at midnight with a unique celebration of all things Star Wars. We're also very excited about the November release of Star Wars: Battlefront, an incredible new action title from EA for core gamers based on epic Star Wars battles, set in new landscapes featured in The Force Awakens. This game and other upcoming initiatives demonstrates that Star Wars, like Marvel, represents a storytelling universe that can cut across platforms and mediums throughout our businesses and have a profound effect on our growth and profitability for years to come. Obviously, we have a lot to look forward to throughout the rest of this year and beyond. We're pleased with our results in Q2 and remain confident that our proven strategy can continue to drive value and opportunity well into the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay to walk you through the details of the quarter.\nJay Rasulo: Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Second-quarter earnings per share, adjusted for items affecting comparability, were up a solid 11%, driven by a 7% increase in revenue. Media networks revenue was up 13% and operating income was down 2%, as lower operating income at cable more than offset strong results at broadcasting. At cable, while total revenue was up 11% due to strong growth in affiliate and advertising revenues, operating income was down 9%. This decline was driven by higher programming and production costs at ESPN due to the College Football Playoff and NFL wild-card game at the [indiscernible] Network. As you know, fiscal 2015 is the first year of the new College Football Playoff and the first time ESPN has aired an NFL wild-card game. So as we expected, cable programming and production costs were up significantly in the second quarter. We continue to expect relatively flat programming and production costs in the second half of the year. So our full-year outlook is unchanged. We still expect programming and production costs to be up low teen percentage points for fiscal 2015. Domestic cable affiliate revenue was up low double digits in Q2, benefiting from contractual rate increases, the SEC Network and lowered deferred affiliate revenue at ESPN. The increase in domestic cable affiliate revenue includes a year-over-year benefit of $40 million, as ESPN did not defer any affiliate revenue in the second quarter this year compared to $40 million in Q2 last year. Adjusting for the timing of deferred revenue, domestic cable affiliate revenue was still up 10%. And just remind you, ESPN didn't defer any revenue during either Q1 or Q2, resulting in an aggregate year-over-year affiliate revenue benefit of $176 million for the first half of the year compared to the prior year. This benefit will be reversed during Q3 which means ESPN will recognize $176 million less deferred revenue in Q3 compared to last year. And for those of you who have followed us for many years, you will be happy to know that Q3 will be the last quarter in which we need to discuss programming covenants and their impact on revenue recognition. Due to contractual provisions and ESPN's new affiliate agreement, ESPN is no longer required to defer a portion of its affiliate revenue. Turning to advertising, ESPN ad revenue was up 18% in the second quarter due to higher rates and increasing units sold. Ad revenue at ESPN benefited from the strong interest in the first ever College Football Playoff and our NFL wild-card playoff game. So far this quarter, ESPN ad sales are pacing down a few percentage points compared prior year. So keep in mind that ad revenue in Q3 of last year benefited from the World Cup. Broadcasting operating income increased 90%, driven by an increase in affiliate revenue, higher program sales and an increase in ad revenue, partially offset by higher marketing costs at the ABC Network. The growth in affiliate revenue was due to contractual rate increases as well as new contracts. Program sales were up in the second quarter, driven by the sale of Marvel's Daredevil and by higher sales of ABC Studio shows, including Lost and Once Upon a Time. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was up mid-single digits in the quarter as a result of higher primetime ratings and higher rates. Quarter-to-date scatter pricing at the network is running low-single digits above upfront levels. At parks and resorts, operating income was up 24% net on revenue growth of 6% due to higher results at our domestic operations which were partially offset by lower results at our international operations. Total segment margins were up 230 basis points. During the second quarter, growth in operating income at our domestic operations was driven by higher guest spending and attendance at our domestic parks, sales of vacation club units at Disney's Polynesian Villas and Bungalows and higher pricing at the Disney Cruise Line, partially offset by higher costs. For the quarter, attendance at our domestic parks was up 2% and per capita spending was up 7% on higher ticket prices and an increase in spending on food and beverage and merchandise. Occupancy at our domestic hotels was up 2.5 percentage points to 89% and per-room spending was up 6%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 7% compared to prior-year levels, while book rates are up 2%. At Studio Entertainment, revenue and operating income were down in the second quarter, given very difficult comps due to the impact of Frozen in the prior year. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of the Studio slate, as Q2 was one of the best quarters in the Studio's history. Lower operating income at the Studio was driven by decreases in domestic home entertainment and international theatrical distribution, both of which reflect the record-breaking performance of Frozen in the prior year compared to Big Hero 6 this year, partially offset by higher revenue per share from consumer products. Consumer product segment operating income was up 32% on revenue growth of 10% which is net of consumer products revenue share for the Studio. Margins were up over 600 basis points in Q2, reflecting continued strength in merchandise licensing which was driven by Frozen and, to a lesser extent, Avengers. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue in the second quarter was up 23% over last year which underscores the strength, depth and breadth of our licensing portfolio. At interactive, higher operating income in the second quarter was due to lower marketing and product and development costs, driven by fewer titles in development and higher results of our mobile games business which continue to benefit from the success of Tsum Tsum. These increases were partially offset by lower performance of Disney Infinity. During the second quarter, we returned an aggregate $2.4 billion in capital to our shareholders, consisting of $485 million for share buyback and a dividend of almost $2 billion. Fiscal year to date, we've returned about $3.9 billion to our shareholders via dividends and buybacks, including roughly $2 billion of share repurchases. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Lowell and we'll be happy to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nathanson: I have one for Bob and then a follow-up for Jay. Bob, can you help us with this? We've seen Disney's networks on Sling TV, but the same networks are not on Sony's new platform. And then there's a dispute with Verizon over their mini bundle. So I wonder could you share with us your perspective on the factors and the principles that guide your willingness to work with new MVPD offerings?\nBob Iger: Sure, Michael. As you'd expect, when we look at these new offerings, we look at a couple of factors, namely do they have strategic value to the company and are they beneficial to us financially? We also like to analyze the packages in terms of what we believe they offer customers, because we happen to believe that navigation has become really critical. On that note, by the way, the reason we like navigation is the better the navigation, usually the better the consumption. Poor navigation usually leads to less consumption. In the Verizon case, we were simply asking them to adhere to the contract that they had negotiated with us. In general, as it relates to skinny packages, we've been, for the most part, at the forefront of offering consumers more choice, because we happen to think that we've entered into an era where the consumer has more authority and therefore is going to demand more flexibility and more customization. But it's also clear that price-value relationship is important. Consumers still want a lot of choice at the right price. Sling's case was mostly of interest to us, because their strategy was to go after the roughly 12 million broadband-only households in the United States with a skinny or a less expensive package. So we thought there was value there from a strategic and a financial perspective. In the Sony case, I don't have to get into many details, but simply put, it wasn't to our advantage financially. But again, overall, we think new entrants into the distribution marketplace good for us. I will say that I have not seen many so-called skinny packages, except for the Sling package, that I think is particularly attractive to consumers in terms of the price-to-value relationship. And I think the last thing I think needs to be said is -- and I know that some of you have written about this -- is that when you unbundle, particularly your broadband service, there are going to be a hidden cost or there are hidden costs. As a for instance, you buy an expanded basic bundle, you get broadband with it. You buy a skinny package, you have to pay extra for broadband and that cost goes up substantially. So I think one of the questions that has yet to be answered is what savings or how large does the savings have to be for the consumer to essentially abandon the expanded basic package and the choice that it gives for some less expensive package with far less choice. And are there other costs ramifications, like the one that I just cited. So again, the jury is still out on a lot of this. No question that there are changes going on in the media landscape, although we do not see a disturbing trend as it relates to the expanded basic bundle. And we're going to continue evaluate these things based on the criteria I just mentioned.\nMichael Nathanson: And for Jay on broadcast. In the past, you guys stated that retrans would be somewhere between $400 million and $500 million. You reaffirmed that last quarter. But given the strength of results now, I wonder could you update us on retrans? Is it going to be larger than that range now that we've seen these results?\nJay Rasulo: I guess I can say that we gave that goal a few years ago and we're pretty confident that we're going to comfortably exceed that goal in our total retrans. For the second -- relative to this year, for the second half of the year, we're going to have retrans and license fee revenue that roughly matches what you've seen in the first half of the year. But when you look at that from a growth basis, because of the timing of the new deals that were done, that the growth in the first half of the year is going to widely exceed what you see in terms of growth for the second half of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani: It seems like MyMagic+ has really improved capacity at Disney World. And you've had a number of record attendance quarters lately. I guess how much can you continue to see those gains? And any color on how international visitors may have trended in the quarter?\nTom Staggs: Sure, Alexia. So as you know that MyMagic+ has had an impact, especially as we've now started to anniversary the startup costs that we had there. And it really is integrated into the total Walt Disney World guest experience. So it's difficult to say just how much it contributed because it's so integrated, but it clearly was a contributor to results. We've got roughly half of our guests now are entering the parks with Magic Bands and the response from those guests has been overwhelmingly positive. So we're very pleased with that. My Magic Band or MyMagic+ has a driver going forward, it will still be a factor, but perhaps not with this great an impact, as we've seen just in this quarter. Again, as it becomes even more integrated into the base experience. Looking forward, I think that we're most excited about what we see in terms of the prospects outside of the United States with the opening of Shanghai Disney Resort next year and that should drive growth well into the future. Having said that, though, we saw a strong international attendance this year at our domestic parks. There's no question that those results have been strong. And the top line growth, coupled with the close minding of the expense line, has resulted in strong growth and we hope to see our results continue there.\nAlexia Quadrani: And just any update you can give us on [Technical Difficulty] plans to further incorporate Star Wars into the parks?\nJay Rasulo: Well, nothing specific to announce, although I think, as Bob had mentioned on the last earnings call, we're working on development of potential plans. And it's something that we look for as likely a factor in our development in the future, especially as we look in future years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Cohen: I have two questions. First on Star Wars, this is a franchise unlike any other, obviously. We've never seen anything like this. So could you talk broadly about your strategy to drive consumer interest? It seems like there's a frenzy already, but what was the -- can you just talk about the ramp up to December 18 on a global basis? Because there's a whole generation that wasn't born for the last round the films. And I know Tom mentioned the consumer products phase. So if you could just expand on what you're doing leading into December 18.\nBob Iger: I think first of all, you have to understand that this is already a very strong franchise. But a film has not been released in 10 years. And so while we're not treating this as something that is brand new, we're mindful of the fact that there's a whole generation of people out there that were not as steeped in the Star Wars lore and not as, in effect, in love with the franchise as an older generation. And there are markets around the world that weren't as developed back 10 years ago and beyond that. China is probably the best example; it's now the number two movie market in the world. Obviously, when the last Star Wars film released, it was barely a market from a movie perspective. We're managing all of this with great care as well in that while we're mindful of the fact that we need to market this and go after this new generation and new territories, we also want to be careful that the demand does not create almost too much in the marketplace too soon. And so everything that we have done to date has been extremely deliberate. And we have an extremely careful -- carefully constructed and deliberate plan going forward in terms of what we roll out in the marketplace, both in terms of product and in terms of marketing. The release of the six films digitally is probably a good example of that. We did that in April to at least make it available for the first time on a digital platform on a worldwide basis. And that's been, I think, helpful. We've already got some increased product in the marketplace, but the real ramp up from a consumer products perspective won't come until just a few months prior to the release. We have already talked about some games that will come into the marketplace. EA had an announcement at Star Wars Celebration, for instance. You can expect that there will be more game-related activity between now and the release. And I think generally speaking, you're going to see us release in a very, very careful way certain elements of the film as part of a marketing -- a very carefully designed marketing plan, again as we get much closer to the film. I will say we've been overwhelmed with interest. We knew when we purchased this that there was great interest and value, but so far, it has well exceeded our expectations. The reaction to the two teaser trailers I think is one example of that, over 80 million hits on this last teaser trailer in 24 hours and hundreds of millions since. Quite amazing. We're pleased with what we've seen so far of the film and we can't wait to show it to the world. I think we've got something here that is very, very special, that's going to create value for the company for many, many years to come across the world. One of the other two other things I want to mention is we have three films that are going to come into the marketplace between now and May of 2017. Star Wars VII: A Force Awakens in December; Rogue One, the standalone film, a year later. And then of May 2017, we're going to have Star Wars VIII. And all three are in varying stages of development and production. And then Tom mentioned parks and resorts. We've got a huge opportunity there. And we've had single attractions, Star Tours, in multiple around the world that have remained successful. And some Jedi Training Academy-related shows here and there. But the opportunity here in the United States and other places around the world is tremendous and we're doing some developmental work on it, but over time, there is great potential there, too.\nJessica Reif Cohen: My second question is about advertising. How different will the upfront be this year, given the measurement issues and changes in guarantees and given the onset of programmatic buying? How are you approaching that?\nBob Iger: Well, we're starting with putting together a good schedule at ABC and their development has been quite strong. And we know that there's still a traditional approach to this, in that there's still great interest and the greatest interest in the 18-to-49 audience and lesser extent 25-to-54, great interest in women 18-to-49 and probably growing interest in people 18-to-34. We do know that -- I'll call it secondary viewing which is either viewing on the DVR or an SVoD -- is increasing. And ABC is doing extremely well in that category with shows that seem to be performing both in the SVoD and in the DVR playback world. I mean, multiple shows for instance. And by the way, ABC had a good season this season. They were the only network that was up. And that's due to adding new shows to the schedule, like Black-ish and How to Get Away with Murder and Fresh off the Boat, for instance. So they've had a decent season. They are also mindful of the fact that addressable advertising is going to grow. And the ability to create opportunities for advertisers to reach consumers in a more specifically designed way is only going to grow. And they're also going to continue to emphasize the output of their own studio. We've been very successful in putting more ABC-owned shows on the network. That should be the case in this upcoming scheduling season as well. And we have the ability as a company to create programs for television platforms. I think the Netflix/Marvel deal is great example of that. So as we look at the television environment, we think the network is well positioned. We think the growth in what I'll call new media is only going to continue and we're going to take advantage of that. And generally speaking, we think the advertising or the upfront is going to be just fine for our network and for our company. The last thing I want to say is that there's no question that we're seeing a new advertising reality here, because money definitely has migrated out of traditional media into new media which is one of the reasons why we've shown such an interest in new media. The last thing I'll say is as a company, about 16% of our revenue this year is advertising generated. So it's still a substantial amount of money, but our exposure to these changes is less than a lot of the other media companies.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Bank from RBC Capital Markets.\nDavid Bank: This question I guess is for Bob primarily, but would love to hear all your thoughts. It's a follow-up, really, on Michael's earlier question. And I'd put it in the context of you know, I think Disney has embraced, rather than fought, change in the evolving ecosystem about as much as it possibly could. Pretty much every step of the way over the past decade. So -- and we have hopefully been one of those people who have done some analysis on that lighter OTT bundle. And if you assume that cost has some relationship with value-added to the consumer, the vast majority of value in a product like Sling is really coming from the Disney bundle, probably more specifically ESPN. So when you think about it the way we look at it, Disney really has the ability to mirror the general entertainment content the same level contained in Sling outside of the ESPN product. We think you could probably replicate what's in Sling. So if that goes well, why wouldn't you launch your own direct-to-consumer product? If the idea is to target broadband-only homes, you could sort of do that yourself. You could build the best interface. When is the time to do that? Thanks.\nBob Iger: I don't know that there is an absolute answer in terms of timing. In terms of ability, we have said that with these channels and these brands -- ESPN, ABC, Disney, maybe even down the road something related to Star Wars and Marvel -- we do have an ability as a company to take product, specifically filmed entertainment, television, movies, directly to consumers. And we've got some development underway to do just that. That said, the distributors, whether it's cable or satellite or even some of the new platforms, create real value for us, too. They already are in the customer acquisition business. They've already spent significant amount of money in capital to create their platforms. And they manage the relationship with the consumer, whether it's billing or technology or whatever fairly effectively. And so they create value for us and they also help us market. So I think there's a balance here. And I think what I'm saying is that as long as the current distribution ecosystem or the one that seems to be emerging continues to create value for us, then we'll rely on it to distribute our product. When we believe that our opportunity to distribute directly is bigger than or better than the opportunity for others to distribute, then we'll go into that business more aggressively. And I don't think any other company is positioned as well as we're to do that because of the strength of those brands. I thought your analysis, by the way, David, was really well done. I read most of it. It was lengthy, by the way, but I thought it was really well done. Provocative in some cases. And actually the comment that I made earlier about unbundling broadband, I actually got from that analysis. So I appreciate it. I think we're entering into a pretty interesting world, where technology is for the most part the friend of high quality media. Because it's going to give us many more opportunities to reach customers, either directly or through third-parties. So we're viewing this as kind of a new world order in many ways, because of I think the impact of technology on media, but one that's going to be very beneficial to this company.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Juenger from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nTodd Juenger: I'd like to come back to more of a traditional television environment a little bit, for whoever would like to comment. Would just love your thoughts on you and your partners at A&E and your thoughts on what might be going on there. Ratings are not, I'm sure, where you want them. Would love to hear your thoughts on how much you think of that as structural, how much of it is specific content-related or cyclical and thoughts on how you might plan to turn that around. And also any comment on whether we expect to see anything material from that, good or bad, in earnings. And I have a quick follow-up. Thanks.\nBob Iger: As you know, A&E LifeTime is a 50-50 joint venture with Hearst, so obviously it is a value to us because of its size and impact on the bottom line. But we rarely comment about it or we rarely speak for them, I should say. What we do know about A&E's ratings is that they were highly driven by and dependent upon the success of Duck Dynasty. And those ratings have definitely decreased and that is, I think, having some impact. But we really believe in the [Technical Difficulty] of A&E led by Nancy Dubuc. And know that she's addressing the issue in many, we think, very positive ways. And we're, generally speaking, quite bullish about our business in the future. It remains a good brand.\nJay Rasulo: Todd, not a driver for the quarter, by the way.\nTodd Juenger: Okay, thanks. A quick follow-up on something you do fully own and control, then, if you don't mind which is turning to kids' side. There's obviously been a massive dislocation in traditional advertising GRPs targeted to kids. You happen to have the leading kids' properties and networks right now. Anything you can do to take advantage of that dislocation, either through traditional or nontraditional means? Thanks.\nBob Iger: Well, the Disney Channel doesn't sell advertising in the United States, so we're far less vulnerable to some of those shifts. Disney XD, we do sell advertising in. I mentioned earlier that advertising only 16% of our revenue which I guess on the big base is still a big number, but not as significant to our company it is to others. We think that the opportunity in terms of kids' programming for us is to continue to leverage the brand and the intellectual property that we have to drive increased consumption which will, in our case, probably generate revenue that's more on the subscription side or, so I'll call it, the video-on-demand or pay-per-view side. That also, by the way, will drive other revenue at the company, whether it's the theme parks or consumer products.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from UBS. Please go ahead. \nDoug Mitchelson: So one for Bob and then one for Tom and Jay. Bob, I'm curious for your thoughts on virtual MVPDs and how you think about their influence on the ecosystem longer term in one particular regard, right, so. Sony Vue and Apple TV can run their virtual bundles at little to no margin as they sort of use your software to drive their core hardware business. So the good news is they can pay you more and charge consumers less for the same bundle. Longer term, though, if they're not running those businesses for profit, do their long-term interests diverge from programmers and would a Sony or an Apple gain negotiating leverage over programmers that traditional distributors have not had recently? So I know it's early days, but you're always very forward-thinking on the digital stuff. And for Tom and Jay, the Star Wars franchise and Shanghai Disneyland both seem difficult to forecast -- at least I find them to be difficult. I was hoping you could help investors understand the potential financial performance for those assets. What comparables would you highlight or metrics are you willing to provide to help us understand the financial contribution they could make? Thank you.\nBob Iger: So Doug, as it relates to virtual MVPDs. I was listening to your question about Shanghai and I almost forgot the first question. We have a lot of leverage because of these channels, actually. I don't think anybody can successfully launch a distribution business without the channels that this company owns, frankly. And whether they run them as loss leaders or not, I don't think that really has much of an impact on us. And I think that generally, new entrants into the marketplace are going to create new opportunities, either because they attract more consumers or they offer an experience to the consumer or a price-to-value relationship that's more attractive than the existing distributors. I just think it's a good dynamic for us. I also mentioned earlier navigation. If a product comes forward that is more robust in terms of user interface, that's great for us. If our product can be found more readily, used more readily, enjoyed more readily, I think that it will increase consumption. And that's one of the reasons why it's not always just about price for us, it's about the experience. As it relates to Shanghai, I don't know -- Jay and Tom, you want to grab this?\nTom Staggs: Well, I represent Shanghai, as Bob mentioned. We're really excited about what we're seeing come out of the ground there. You will continue to see the preopening costs ramp up over the quarters leading up to the opening. And so that will extend into 2016 with the opening in spring. And from there, then, we will see. We're not going to make any specific prediction for you. But then we will ramp it up towards profitability after opening, so that the real positive impact from Shanghai Disneyland we'll really -- you'll see it in years post 2016. But at the same time, as we've discussed in many times on these calls, the prospects there are spectacular. And certainly planting the flag in China we think will have a ripple effect throughout the rest of our businesses as we establish the brand in that way.\nDoug Mitchelson: Would you be willing to entertain a question around the cadence to reaching some normal level of margins for that park? Is it something that gets to breakeven relatively rapidly or does it take a long time?\nJay Rasulo: It's not something we want to provide specific guidance on at this point.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne: I have a question for Bob and then a follow-up for Jay. Sticking with the theme of leverage over distributors, but turning to the film business, you've had tremendous revenue growth, but you had even more tremendous margin expansion in film. And putting up these huge box office numbers and big margins is tough to do. I wonder if, Bob, if you could talk about what you've done and what Alan has done at the Studio to drive costs down or margins up. And then should we be thinking that you guys are going to get 60% splits with the exhibitors for these large tent pole films, as discussed in The Journal today? Because that has a 10 point improvement from the standard 50% has a pretty profound impact on the profitability of these films. And is there any implication for the international splits, where they're always typically lower? Are you able to exert a similar leverage on the international front?\nBob Iger: We have obviously with our film strategy created and will continue to create huge value for the theater owners here in the United States and around the world. And clearly with the hand that we've got -- Disney and Pixar and Marvel and Star Wars -- our discussions in terms of the rates that we get paid or the splits have factored in the films that we release. But I do not want to get specific about how much more we could get or what the nature of the discussions are. So I want to emphasize again the investment this company has made in its motion pictures and the results are evident in terms of the value creation proposition to the theater owners. In terms of the strategy and the impact that Alan Horn has had, what we set about to do early on was to focus on our core brands and then to acquire others that we thought had similar characteristics. So we focused on Disney and we worked to strengthen the Disney output, particularly in animation. We purchased Pixar in part to do that. And we bought Marvel, because we really believed in that brand in the movie business. And then obviously, Star Wars. And Alan's charge is to help manage those brands on the motion picture side and to make sure that as a Studio, we're focused on quality. And I think the results since he joined us have been stunning. He is a tremendous movie executive. He not only knows the business well, but he manages our business extremely well. And I think the results that we've seen in that business in these last few years are in part the result of what he's brought to the Studio from an experience and from a talent perspective. So we're very focused on those brands. We're focused on improving the quality of the product in a relentless way. We're focused on delivering value, not just to the Disney shareholders, but to the distributors worldwide. And I think the growth that we've seen in that business these last few years is a result of all of that and we believe that that should continue. When you look at what we have in the pipeline, whether it's in Marvel films, including Iron Man this summer and Captain America and two more Avengers films and diversifying to Black Panther and Captain Marvel or what you know what we have that I mentioned earlier on the Star Wars front or what's going on in animation from both Pixar and Disney Animation. We've got a tremendous original film from Pixar this summer called Inside Out and another one called Good Dinosaur later in the year. First time in a calendar year we've ever released two Pixar films. And then we got Toy Story IV, Incredible and Cars and Finding Dory which is a sequel to Nemo. Tremendous hand. So I think you're going to see over the next 5 years to 10 years, certainly 5 years, a real growth from the Studio because of all that.\nBen Swinburne: And then just quickly for Jay on the domestic cable affiliate revenue growth. I think a 10% ex-deferral. I don't know if you wanted to help us think about SEC contribution to that, at least broadly. And can you give us a sense for whether you're seeing any acceleration or deceleration to the core underlying ex-SEC affiliate growth at cable?\nJay Rasulo: Ben, I'm not going to give you -- we don't break out the individual businesses that make up our cable affiliate revenue. But I will only reiterate something we've said before. The launch of the SEC Network was one of the best launches of a new network in cable history. And we continue to be very, very pleased with its progress and how fans have accepted and embraced this new network around, of course what is arguably college football's strongest conference.\nOperator: Our question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi. Please go ahead. \nJason Bazinet: I just have a question for Mr. Iger. I suspect a lot of the acquisitions that you've made over the years were sort of at least in part influenced by your view of how the video ecosystem would change. So I'd just be curious to get your comments in terms of how do you see it evolving relative to your prior expectations and what do you think we can expect next? Thanks.\nBob Iger: Well, I actually think, Jason, I guess my view about the world in general as it related to those acquisitions wasn't specifically related to what you just cited, but it was I guess more related to looking at a world that was going to expand in terms of its voracious appetite for quality content and brands. And I thought technology was going to be more friends than faux in terms of offering us opportunities to reach customers, either directly or through third parties. I also thought technology was going to give us the ability to make better product, whether it was at theme parks or on the filmed entertainment side. And I thought markets were going to develop that were going to create compelling opportunities for us. I think China is a great example of that, whether you look at it from a Shanghai perspective or whether you look at it from a movie perspective. So I just thought the value of high quality intellectual property in the entertainment space was only going to increase because of a variety of different developments in the world. It was that simple. And I saw in Marvel and Pixar and Star Wars/Lucas great intellectual property in known and valued brands that were only going to benefit from the changing dynamics in the marketplace. It was that simple. And they were brands that as a company, we felt that we would be great stewards of because of the stewardship we had of the Disney brand over decades.\nLowell Singer: All right, thanks, Jason. Thanks, everyone for joining us today and for accommodating the change in the schedule. We will be around all day to answer any follow-up questions.

My name is Ellen and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Singer, you may begin.\nLowell Singer: Good afternoon and welcome to the Walt Disney Company\u2019s first quarter 2015 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 45 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today\u2019s call is also being webcast and the webcast and a transcript of the call will also be available on our website. Joining me for today\u2019s call are Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob will lead off followed by Jay and then of course we will be happy to take your questions. So with that, let me turn it over to Bob and we will get started.\nBob Iger: Good afternoon. I am very pleased to announce that Walt Disney Company had another incredibly strong quarter, with diluted earnings per share up 23% to $1.27. These results were driven by solid performance across all of our businesses and once again demonstrate the strength of our brands and content and a proven franchise strategy that will drive long-term value. And Frozen is a great example of this strategy. On March 13, along with Cinderella, we are premiering a new 7-minute short, Frozen Fever, bringing back all the beloved characters and voices and introducing a great new song. This time last year, we were excited about the box office success of Frozen, which went on to win the Oscar and become the highest grossing animated feature of all time. Now, a full year after its release, we are seeing the true impact of Frozen across our entire company. Overall, retail toy sales in North America were up 4% in 2014. And according to a leading market research firm, much of the credit for that growth belongs to Frozen, which was both the biggest and fastest growing toy property of the year. It\u2019s also enormously popular in our parks and resorts. It\u2019s showcased in a successful mobile game and it gave a significant boost to our home entertainment business for the quarter, along with Maleficent and Marvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy. And Frozen is just one of the 11 franchises at Disney currently driving more than $1 billion each in annual retail sales. The strong holiday demand for Frozen as well as Mickey and Minnie, Spider-Man and Avengers led to the most successful quarter ever for Disney consumer products. Among media companies, Disney stands out. No one else comes close to our unparalleled collection of strong brands or our pipeline of great content. And our unprecedented ability to leverage creative success and creating value across the entire company allows us to adapt to emerging challenges, take advantage of new opportunities, and most importantly, innovate for the future. For example, who else but ESPN could launch the first ever College Football Playoff with such enormous and immediate success? The two semifinals and the national championship broke previous records to become the three most watched telecasts in the history of cable television, an achievement that speaks to the tremendous potential of this annual event and further strengthens ESPN\u2019s undisputed position as the number one sports brand. Our studio is obviously a key franchise driver and we have a strong slate of upcoming movies. We started the fiscal year with Disney Animation\u2019s Big Hero 6, which has already generated just under $500 million in global box office. It\u2019s also the number one in Japan for five weeks and is yet to open in some key markets. And Into the Woods has been both acclaimed by critics and embraced by audiences. As I said, next month one of our most beloved and iconic characters comes to life in Disney\u2019s first-ever live-action Cinderella. It\u2019s a fresh look at this classic story and it\u2019s also a stunningly beautiful film. Later in the spring we are looking forward to an original Disney adventure called Tomorrowland, starring George Clooney and directed by Brad Bird. As every Marvel fan knows the highly anticipated Avengers sequel, Avengers: Age of Ultron opens in May. And when the first trailer was released in November fans viewed it more than 34 million times in just 24 hours. The speed and magnitude of that reaction certainly speaks to the incredible excitement around Avengers. Ant-Man debuts in July bringing another greater character to the screen was model Marvel\u2019s trademark blend of action, humor and heart. We are also thrilled to have two original Pixar movies on the way this year. In June Inside Out will give audiences an all access pass into the mind of an 11-year-old girl and the Thanksgiving, The Good Dinosaur takes a humorous look of what world would be like if the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs had actually missed. Of course a millions of Star Wars fans, the first 11 months of this year will be an exciting countdown to the December 18 release of Star Wars, The Force Awakens. There is a strong emotional connection to this franchise that transcends geography and generations and the brief teaser trailer released last November has been viewed more than 123 million times. Having been on the set and seen most of the footage I can definitely say that our excitement is justified, it marks the beginning of a new era of exceptional Star Wars storytelling as well as an opportunity for continued growth across all of our businesses. As a truly global company, we have talked a lot about the importance of developing local content. And the success of the film PK in India is a perfect example. It\u2019s now India\u2019s highest grossing movie of all-time with almost $107 million in global box office. It\u2019s also Bollywood\u2019s most successful movie ever, co-produced and released by our Indian subsidiary, UTV, PK will soon be on 3,500 screens across China. This is also a dynamic and exciting time for our parks and resorts with another very strong performance in Q1 and plenty to look forward to including the spectacular Shanghai Disney Resort. I was in China the week before last and saw amazing progress. We just topped off our signature Shanghai Disneyland Hotel and we are nearing completion on iconic features throughout the park including the largest castle we have ever built. And we are getting ready to start testing hundreds of performers we will need to entertain our guests. It\u2019s thrilling to see Shanghai Disney Resort rapidly coming to life. The artistry, complexity, the magnitude of the detail, it\u2019s all quite astonishing As you recall after we broke ground on this incredible resort, we announced an $800 million expansion, significantly increasing both the size of the park and the number of attractions available to our guests on opening day. Even with that expansion, we will complete major construction by the end of this calendar year. And we are planning a spectacular grand opening in the spring of 2016, which we believe is the optimal time to showcase the full grandeur of this world-class destination. Obviously, we are proud of our performance and our record of creating significant value for our company and our shareholders and we are very optimistic about our future. And now I am going to turn the call over to Jay to take you through the details of our Q1 performance. And then we will take questions. Jay?\nJay Rasulo: Thanks Bob and good afternoon everyone. Fiscal 2015 is off to a great start as we delivered another strong quarter of financial results. Earnings per share were up 23% driven by record revenue, up 9% over last year and 17% growth in the segment operating income. The results this quarter, which I will go with more detail in a moment, are further evidence that our strategy of investing in high quality content drives significant long-term value across our businesses. At consumer products, our broad content portfolio fueled incredibly strong financial results. Segment operating income was up 46% on revenue growth of 22%. Margins expanded by 720 basis points, reflecting strength in both our merchandise licensing and retail businesses. Growth in was driven by Frozen and to a lesser extent Disney Channel properties Mickey and Minnie, Spiderman and Avengers, partially offset by higher revenue share with the Studio. On a comparable basis earned licensing revenue in the first quarter was up an impressive 23% over last year, which is particularly notable given the size of our licensing business. Higher results in our retail business were primarily due to the continued demand for Frozen merchandise which drove double-digit growth in same-store sales in North America, Europe and Japan as well as higher online sales in those regions. At the studio, the success of our fiscal 2014 theatrical slate continued to drive financial benefits in the first quarter. Operating income was up 33% over last year due to increases in home entertainment, higher revenue share of consumer products and an increase in television distribution. While we are very pleased with the worldwide box office performance of Big Hero 6, theatrical results were lower in the first quarter, reflecting the record-breaking performance of Frozen last year. The increase in home entertainment was primarily driven by higher unit sales of Guardians of the Galaxy, Frozen and Maleficent compared to Monsters University and the Lone Ranger in Q1 last year. The increase in television distribution in the first quarter was due to better performance of Q1 titles, including the Avengers, Captain America 2 and Frozen compared to last year\u2019s titles. The studio recognized a higher revenue share in consumer products in the first quarter due to strong sales of Frozen merchandise. The Parks and Resorts segment had another great quarter. Operating income was up 20% on a revenue growth of 9% due to continued strength at our domestic operations. Despite the lower results at our international operations, total segment margins were up 190 basis points with major new initiatives accounting for 80 basis points of the year-over-year increase. We continued to be pleased with the performance of our recent major investments that they have contributed nicely to the robust growth of the domestic-based business. In the first quarter, growth in operating income in our domestic operations was driven by higher guest spending and attendance at our domestic parks and higher passenger cruise days at the Disney Cruise line partially offset by higher costs. For the quarter attendance at our domestic parks was up 7%, with Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resort, each setting an all-time attendance record for any quarter. Per capita spending in our domestic parks was up 4% on higher ticket prices, merchandise, and food and beverage spending. Occupancy on our domestic hotels was up 8 percentage points to 89% and per room spending was up 4%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 3% compared to prior year levels, while book rates are up 4%. Turning to media networks, segment revenue was up 11% and operating income was up 3% as higher results at broadcasting were partially offset by lower results at cable due primarily to higher programming and production costs at ESPN. Broadcasting operating income increased 35% driven by higher affiliate revenue and higher program sales partially offset by lower ad revenue. The growth in affiliate revenue was due to contractual rate increases as well as higher rates in new affiliate agreements. Program sales were up in the first quarter due to sales of ABC Studio shows, including Criminal Minds, Scandal and Once Upon a Time. Ad revenue at the network was down in the quarter as a result of fewer primetime units sold partially offset by higher rates. Quarter-to-date scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 10% above upfront levels. Cable segment results were down modestly as lower operating income at ESPN was partially offset by increases at worldwide Disney channels and ABC Family. Lower results at ESPN were primarily due to higher programming and production costs and to a lesser extent higher marketing costs related to the College Football Playoff and the launch of the SEC Network. This quarter\u2019s results reflect ESPN\u2019s continued investment in what is already a deepest and broadest portfolio of sports rights. As a result, programming and production expenses were up mid-teens percent during the first quarter due to higher expenses for NFL rights. And this is the first year of ESPN\u2019s new 8-year contract and additional sports rights for the SEC Network. As we have discussed in the past, we expect growth in cable programming costs to be in the low-teens and that increase will be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. We expect cable programming costs to be up about 25% in the first half of the fiscal year and relatively flat in the second half. The cost increase this quarter and what we expect in Q2 are consistent with the first half and full year outlook. ESPN has long-term agreements in place for the most valuable sports rights. While the first year of new contracts may result s in above-trend cost increases and adversely effect results in the short-term. We remain confident in our ability to continue to grow ESPN over long-term. During the first quarter we entered into a major affiliate distribution deal, marking a completion of new agreements with our ten largest affiliate partners. Due to contractual provisions in ESPN\u2019s new affiliate agreements, ESPN will no longer defer a portion of its affiliate revenue for most of its contracts as was previously the case. Domestic cable affiliate revenue was up 20% in the quarter reflecting the benefits of new affiliate agreements, lower deferred revenue at ESPN and the launch of SEC Network. The 20% increase in affiliate revenue includes a year-over-year benefit of $136 million at ESPN deferred, $136 million in affiliate revenue in Q1 last year compared to no deferred affiliate revenue in Q1 this year. Adjusting for the timing of deferred revenues at ESPN, domestic cable affiliate revenue was up low double-digits. Ad revenue at ESPN was down 2% in the first quarter. While total day ratings were up, ad revenue was lower as ratings for certain key programs were down compared to last year, partially offset by higher rates. So far this quarter, ESPN ad sales are pacing up 18% on the strength of the first College Football Playoff which aired last month. The increase at worldwide Disney channels was due to higher affiliate revenue at domestic channel and higher advertising revenue at international channels, partially offset by higher programming costs. The increase at ABC Family was driven by higher affiliate and advertising revenues reflecting an increase in units sold. At Interactive, operating income increased 36% in the quarter driven by higher results from our mobile gaming business due to the continued success of Tsum Tsum as well as lower product development costs, partially offset by lower results at our console games business. Lower console game performance reflected higher producing costs, driven by Disney Infinity, lower unit sales and higher marketing costs. The decrease in unit sales was driven by lower sales of catalog titles and Disney Infinity figures, partially offset by higher sales of Disney Infinity starter packs. We continued to take a balanced approach to tackle allocation by investing for the long-term sustainable growth, while returning meaningful capital to our shareholders. During the first quarter, we repurchased 15 million shares for about $1.3 billion and increased our dividend by 34% from $0.86 per share to $1.15 per share. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased 15.5 million shares for about $1.4 billion. Overall, we feel great about this quarter. As we look across our businesses there is a lot to be excited about in 2015 and beyond. But we are not taking anything for granted as we have recognized we had a lot of work ahead of us. We believe the strength of our brands coupled with the integrated nature of our company can create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to Lowell and we would be happy to take your questions.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thank you, Jay. Operator we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now being the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.\nMichael Nathanson: [Technical Difficulty] I have one for Jay. So Bob now that we have seen the Dish Sling offer, we had a question, we wonder if you had any insight into whether or not the ESPN viewer is also a heavy RSN viewer. And if so how does that affect the take up rates of a bundle that doesn\u2019t have an RSN, but has ESPN?\nBob Iger: Michael we don\u2019t really have that much data on one how much Dish has succeeded in selling the Sling package to its customers. And we don\u2019t have data on the customers themselves right now. So, we just don\u2019t know. I will say though since you give me the opportunity that it\u2019s all designed to attract consumers or households that are either cord-nevers or cord-laters. And we believe that there is an attractiveness too or a real justification for trying to convince, particularly millennials to sign up for some form of subscription TV when they might not have signed up for any.\nMichael Nathanson: I guess the question is, are millennials who are sports fans also RSN fans or you think it\u2019s a starter package for them using ESPN?\nBob Iger: We just don\u2019t have \u2013 we don\u2019t have data. I think your premise is interesting that if they want ESPN, chances are they are RSN viewers and if they are RSN viewers, then they probably have to have the expanded basic bundle. So, we are probably I am guessing that, I think I am not sure what you are referring here, maybe what you are suggesting is that there aren\u2019t many left. In other words that, if they are sports fans, then they probably have to have expanded base of cable, because they have to get it to get RSN. Is that what you are saying?\nMichael Nathanson: Yes, that\u2019s what I am saying.\nBob Iger: So, there is not many left, we will see. We don\u2019t have enough data yet.\nMichael Nathanson: Okay. And let me move to Jay, thanks Bob. And then Jay you said occupancy in the hotels in Disney parks and resorts were up 89%, going back to your history of running parks and resorts, once you get to 89%, can you talk about what types of pricing levers do you see historically, because I think that\u2019s probably the best number we have seen pre-recession or post-recession?\nJay Rasulo: Michael, I think hoteliers in general will tell you that to try to fill a hotel beyond 89%, 90%, 91% is extremely difficult, because it takes \u2013 to go beyond that, it takes too many match-ups of people who are staying three nights checking out replaced by five nights replaced in rapid succession, it becomes quite difficult. So, I think that you are right that when you see occupancy in that kind of range, you are getting close to pretty much a full house and those were historically the numbers at which we started to think about expanded capacity. Of course, relative to the Orlando market, there are many \u2013 still many, many more hotel rooms off property than they are on property. And I am sure they are not experiencing rates of occupancy anything like that.\nMichael Nathanson: Okay, thanks. Thanks Jay.\nJay Rasulo: You are welcome.\nLowell Singer: Thank you, Michael. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America, please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Cohen: Thanks. I guess on the theme parks, two things. Is there any \u2013 on MyMagic+, is there if anyway you can give us some color or quantify the impact on guest spending and guest flow, that\u2019s something you mentioned that it would improve efficiency? How should we think about the benefits of MyMagic+? And the second question is in this ramp-up to Shanghai, can you give us some more color or detail on the financial impact in fiscal \u201815 as you spend into the opening of \u201816?\nBob Iger: Well, on MyMagic+, Jessica, I will take this one. First of all, about 10 million guests have already worn the bands. And so what we are hearing from them is overwhelmingly positive, basically a percentage that rated as excellent is significant. So, what that basically tells us and what we actually have seen is that it is serving the purpose that we set out to serve, which is to essentially make the experience more seamless, basically make it easier to give people an opportunity to enjoy what they do when they visit Orlando or Walt Disney World even more than they used to it and make them enjoy more of it, meaning experience more. Just to give you for instance there were days during the holiday season where we were entertaining 250,000 guests at a time on property. And when you just consider how many guests you have to flow through the gates when the park opens in the morning, the fact that you have a band that enables you to basically walk right in, touch the band to a kiosk and keep going, instead of handing a ticket to a cast member making sure the ticket is right and then going in. That\u2019s obviously creating a huge improvement meaning much quicker entrance into the park. And what this all adds up to is our ability to manage more people at a time without in any way diminishing guest experience. We did see in the quarter a positive impact to the bottom line from MyMagic+ just the beginnings of it. We will continue to see more of that, but we do not have data that we can share with you right now about specific guest spending.\nJay Rasulo: Jessica, this is Jay tying in your second question about Shanghai pre-opening costs. I am not going to go into the details of what that will be in fiscal \u201915, but following on what Bob just said about MyMagic+ becoming accretive this quarter, I will tell you that the increase in contribution from MyMagic+ this year will outweigh the preopening spending on Shanghai Disneyland in our total numbers for fiscal \u201915. So that might give you some sense at least that Shanghai will not be a drag on our earnings in fiscal \u201915.\nJessica Reif Cohen: Great. Thank you.\nBob Iger: Thanks a lot.\nLowell Singer: You\u2019re welcome. Operator next question please.\nOperator: Doug Mitchelson with UBS, please go ahead.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thank you so much. So I have one for Bob, one for Jay as well. Bob your comments on Sling TV and not having data on the customers hits squarely on the question I wanted to ask you which is with the broadband only non-Pay TV market growing in size, I would think it becomes ever more interesting for Disney to address that. And I think the default is generally support the existing Pay TV bundle and highlight Hulu and Sing as dipping your toe in the water. But I was hoping you address whether there is a potentially superior business model for Disney to capture the distribution margin yourself, benefit from dynamic advertising targeted of course and having that direct relationship with the consumer that you have been seeking. And I will just throw Jay\u2019s question in there now as well, you have been asked a lot of questions on recent calls about ESPN\u2019s top line I wanted to refocus on margins, so with the March 2015 quarter the company is finishing long and expensive build-out sports rights, it seems like the rest of the decade you have only got a couple of tough quarters when the NBA hits. Are we thinking about that correctly that even if ESPN revenue growth might moderate a bit cost growth is also moderating, any reason to think that margins shouldn\u2019t generally be flat to up going forward ex-those NBA quarters? Thanks so much.\nBob Iger: Doug, I will take the first quarter of the question or your first question since it was directed to me and you are right there are 12 million right now subscribers to broadband only service. And that\u2019s the subscriber that we are trying to reach with this Sling or the Dish is trying to reach with the Sling package. And we believe that it\u2019s a worthwhile experiment to a worthy attempt to try to convince young people or younger people to sign up the cable when they wouldn\u2019t have signed up for it at all they might have waited, Michael\u2019s comment aside. There is definitely an opportunity not just for ESPN, but for other Disney brands to ultimately put products in the marketplace that reach consumers directly. We think we have that opportunity with Disney branded service. We may have an opportunity to bring out Marvel type product and possibly even Star Wars. But we also are mindful of the value of the expanded basic bundle to this company. And we do not believe that there is any reason for us to attempt to take out some of this product particularly ESPN quickly or right now. In other words there is time. If we see that the market dynamics are changing in such a way that it\u2019s better for us as a company to take the product out directly and to not only improve our margins by taking out the middleman, but to create a closer relationship with the consumer that can be mined for other revenue generating purposes then we will do that. But we think if we were to do that now, it would be somewhat precipitous of us and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any reason to be that way.\nDoug Mitchelson: Understood. And then Jay?\nJay Rasulo: In terms of your question on costs, let me tell you this Doug. First of all there are only a couple of bumps left, big upticks in the ESPN programming cost base over the next let\u2019s call it 4 or 5 years. The first one we are in the middle of which is our new NFL deal, the launch of the SEC Network and start and next quarter in a pretty significant way the BCS College Football Playoffs. And the second big one down the road in \u201917 is beginning of our new NBA deals. Other than those bumps which as I said one were in the middle of in fact we gave you some guidance on costs this year that we would be experiencing very heavy ESPN programming costs in the first half of the year and much lighter in the second I can tell you that those numbers look like about 25% in the first half of the year and only a 1% \u2013 flat to 1% increase in the second half of the year. And then there is 2017, when the NBA deal sticks in \u2013 kicks in. So, we have told you many, many times. Of course, I am talking about overall cable margins, because that\u2019s all we speak of. Other than that, we have told you many, many times, we don\u2019t run ESPN on a margin basis. We won\u2019t give you guidance on what the margins will look like, but we expect the business to continue to grow. We have those two periods of a year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter cost increases and other than that we still have high expectations for growth in this business.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thank you very much.\nJay Rasulo: You are welcome.\nLowell Singer: Doug thanks for those questions. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan, please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. I have two questions if I can. First, are you seeing the fantastic momentum in the consumer products business continue past the holiday season and how early can we sort of begin to see a ramp in front of Star Wars? And the second question sort of bigger picture question on advertising, it looks like you have a strong start to the year around advertising and ESPN, I guess in part from those very good ratings there. I guess any broader color you can provide on the advertising market, what you are seeing? I think you had mentioned earlier, Bob that you see a little bit of flattening out to the share shift to digital, I guess any color on that?\nBob Iger: We can\u2019t give you much guidance on consumer products right now except to say that the business that we saw in January was quite strong. And we clearly were seeing some, I will call it even post-holiday momentum, which is unique in terms of our experience. And I think it speaks to continued demand for our franchises. We have got a great lineup of product in the marketplace this year when you consider Cinderella, which is in March and it\u2019s a great film. And clearly, that\u2019s a very important franchise for the company. And then we have got Avengers in May and then of course two Pixar films in calendar 2015, although we don\u2019t know that any one of them will drive significant consumer products and then Star Wars as you mentioned, Alexia, the end of the year. We are not going to predict whether there will be a ramp-up of buying ahead of Star Wars, except that we believe because of the strength of the franchise and the buzz around the movie which we saw certainly was the case when the put the teaser trailer out just around the Christmas time, that we are likely to see some buying in advance of the movie of consumer products. The other thing that I wanted to mention, because we have talked a lot about Frozen, you didn\u2019t mention it is that we are coming out on March 13 attached to Cinderella with a 7-minute Frozen short, that\u2019s just great, that has all the key players both the voice talent and the character talent and other characters and a great song. And we actually believe it\u2019s going to generate some more buzz for Frozen and that should generate more buying in terms of consumer products. Maybe Jay and I can may both address advertising. \nJay Rasulo: Yes.\nBob Iger: Well, Jay, why don\u2019t you go ahead, Jay?\nJay Rasulo: Well, so kind of looking separately at the advertising market for ABC and the advertising market for the sports. Let me start with the latter. The Q2\u2019s marketplace seems to be improved on the sports front. And with the powerhouse lineup of rights that we have in the sporting events that we have in Q2, particularly around the college BCS \u2013 college football playoffs, we are going to be able to take advantage of that uptick in the sports marketplace in Q2. On the ABC front, I think that we are not seeing any radical change in the market from what we have talked about in past quarters. Again, we are very, very happy with the lineup of shows that we have introduced both on the drama and comedy side. We have more of those coming in, in the market. And so we are hopeful that we can also take advantage of the dollars that are out there on the primetime side.\nBob Iger: And one other thing to add, I spoke to the head of ESPN sales this morning, there haven\u2019t been that many new car launches in the last number of months. I know that one of the big automotives just recently \u2013 just released results which were quite positive. We think there is some real potential particularly for ESPN in the automotive category, which has not been a hot category if you watch the Super Bowl, there weren\u2019t that many automotive spots in the Super Bowl for instance. But that\u2019s an opportunity for the rest \u2013 in the rest of the year for ESPN as car companies rollout more new models which they haven\u2019t been doing.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer: Alexia, thanks for the questions. Operator next question please.\nOperator: David Bank with RBC Capital Markets, please go ahead.\nDavid Bank: Okay. Thanks. I have two questions for whoever is willing to answer them. The first one is a follow-up on the last question actually, I was a little surprised at the revenue \u2013 the advertising revenue declines in ABC and that this is one of the most successful seasons to-date that I can remember for ABC, 18 to 49 I think you are flat to marginally up, you really sort of outperforming the rest of the industry. And I would think with a modicum of pricing you would have had stronger growth, so maybe looking for a little more color there. The second question is can you give us \u2013 Jay can you give us the actual change year-over-year in total sub-count at either ESPN or what you call the expanded basic bundle? Thanks very much.\nJay Rasulo: Okay. Thank you, David. Let me start with the advertising question. So to recap scatter pricing was up in the market and overall ad sales as you said were down as ABC sold fewer units this year compared to last year. And the lower unit sales can be attributed to a number of factors and I think the combination is \u2013 combination of those factors had an impact on this quarter making the advertising sales numbers lower. And those are related to the length of the show, how the shows are written, the number of promotional spots we put in these shows as opposed to sold spots, the number of ads we insert into the programs and how we use inventory in the quarter to manage our make good liability. And that \u2013 those all combined to deliver notwithstanding the ratings we had, the relative ratings we had this season to slightly depress our advertising revenue. But I think ABC is extremely well positioned this year relative to its peers. We expect tightening of inventory as the year progresses. And I think we are well positioned to take advantage of the market conditions, hopefully as they improve in the course of the year. On the subscribers side, I am not going to give you any help there. We don\u2019t talk about subscribers, we don\u2019t \u2013 we can\u2019t give you the guidance there. So I am sorry about that.\nDavid Bank: Can\u2019t blame me for trying. Thanks very much guys.\nLowell Singer: David it was a good effort. Thanks for the questions. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: We have Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nTodd Juenger: Alright. Thanks. Let me take an effort at looking a little longer range at the parks if I may. So as the fruits of the slate of parks investments projects are now I think successfully rolling in and Shanghai\u2019s grand openings insight, I wonder if you are at a stage where you are ready to share with us, so anything on your thinking about the future horizon beyond that. I know you won\u2019t announce any specifics, but just generally are there types of opportunities that you can generalize that you find particularly interesting at the top of your list or are there certain things that you considered and rejected, how should investors think about your appetite to continue expanding your parks program. And then the second follow-up Jay if you could just remind us how you are thinking about leverage with all the growth in EBITDA and cash flow I don\u2019t think you have issued much debt lately. So just remind us how you think about leverage as you move through the year? Thanks.\nBob Iger: Todd, in term of the parks, I think what you have to consider is that we are in construction to build a sizable Avatar presence in Avatar Land at Animal Kingdom in Florida. That\u2019s slated to open sometime in 2017. We have a fair amount of design development work going on right now to greatly increase this is no surprise Star Wars presence in multiple locations around the world. We will have more details probably about that later on in 2015. The plans are ambitious and so it\u2019s going to take some time for them to actually be built and open. But let\u2019s just say that we have got big plans for it in [Technical Difficulty] Hong Kong and at Shanghai, obviously Shanghai is yet to open. So, maybe it would sound somewhat premature, but the size of the land that we have there, the expansion opportunities in a market that we think is just perfect for a Disneyland experience suggests that once we open, it\u2019s just the beginning in terms of the variety of offerings that we will be able to provide. And then of course to \u2013 well it\u2019s the franchise that we talked about earlier, which is Frozen, but I think that actually says a lot about other franchises too. There are clearly more opportunities to mind some of these great franchises across the parks. And when you go to Imagineering, there is an embarrassment of riches so to speak, in terms of stories and characters that the Imagineers have to draw from to great, great park experiences. And I think one of the things that we are seeing now in our parks and one of the reasons why the results were so strong across the Board, Christmas time is that there is definitely a halo effect that consumers have for Disney based on all of these franchises and it\u2019s not just what exists in the parks, I think you have to include Marvel and you have to include Star Wars as well. The brand strength has never been stronger. The array of franchise has never been greater. We have said we have got 11 franchises that are going to generate $1 billion this year in retail sales. And that just I think results in enthusiasm for the brand and an enthusiasm for the park experience that we provide, that gives us not only ample opportunities to create from all of that, but for consumers to basically engage with us in more ways in more places than ever before.\nJay Rasulo: Todd, in terms of the balance sheet and our overall perspective on leverage, I guess I will say that we have been \u2013 we are very happy with our balance sheet. We are very happy with our strong ratings in the debt markets at all three agencies. And it really is a strategic asset for the company whether you look at our average cost of debt, the amount of subscription we get to any debt issuance we have put out, the rates at which we are able to manage our working capital through commercial paper, and of course the ease with which we can \u2013 we have thought about and executed on acquisitions without a concern about the impact of those transactions and potential transactions on our rating and on our \u2013 having a debt capacity to do that. So, I think in general, I don\u2019t expect \u2013 you shouldn\u2019t expect a radical change in that strategy. It doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t be in the debt markets this year, but I would expect that you will continue to see a balance sheet that reflects kind of the strategic use of not being \u2013 strategic positioning of not being overleveraged on the operation of our company and our ability to go to the capital markets.\nTodd Juenger: Yes, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you both.\nJay Rasulo: You are welcome.\nLowell Singer: Todd thanks for the questions. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Ben Swinburne, Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne: Two questions for either of you. The first one on consumer products, can you help put Frozen into context forth, now that you have the year, calendar year behind you including the holidays, where you had the inventory where you wanted to. I think years ago, we thought cars was the high watermark in terms of annual revenue contribution, but can you tell us whether Frozen has now exceeded that [Technical Difficulty] and growing licensing contributor year-in, year-out irrespective of whether there is film product, any comment on the margins too? I think your incremental margins at CP were in the almost 80% range. So, any color on profitability would be really helpful? And then I just wanted to make sure that the cable guidance was reconfirmed the high single-digit OI guidance, Jay, if you just could confirm that, that would be great? Thanks.\nJay Rasulo: Okay. Let\u2019s start with your consumer products question. So, look I don\u2019t think that we can underestimate the impact that Frozen has had across our company in all of our businesses, but I don\u2019t think it would be right to take from that the implication that even our consumer products business was overly dominated by the Frozen franchise this quarter. You asked whether we think Frozen has \u2013 to put words in your mouth, we think Frozen has legs. We absolutely believe that this is beginning of a long-term franchise for the company and that will reflect itself in all of our divisions, consumer products certainly not the least of which. But even if you look at the last quarter, many other franchisers, franchises were contributors to the success of the consumer products division. By the way not the least of which was Mickey and Minnie, Disney channel franchises. And we like what Frozen delivered but it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s certainly not one only for us. We have 11 franchises that now retail at over $1 billion as of the last year. So our consumer products business really has a lot of breadth in addition to depth. And we are only beginning this year to see what the Avengers and overall Marvel franchises are going to deliver which has also been a huge contributor. And I think if you look down the road you can imagine that we will be adding Star Wars to that pantheon in a very, very significant play with the release of that film. So it\u2019s a broad-based business and I think that Frozen will continue to play a big part in it. But I wouldn\u2019t make the mistake of thinking that is to say dominant force that you have to worry about repeating year-on-year in the consumer products business. In terms of margin, obviously the licensing business is incredibly highly leveraged. But I think the real margin story for this past quarter has been the Disney stores business where we saw increases both in the physical brick-and-mortar stores in all of the three regions we operate which is Japan, Europe and North America, as well as the online business in those three regions. So we have \u2013 I would venture to say and I think I am right about this we had historic margins in that business this past quarter and it was a big contributor to the margin story for consumer products. Your second question was about OI growth guidance for domestic cable. And I am only going to repeat, we don\u2019t give quarter-to-quarter or annual guidance on that, but I am going to reassert what we said back in April last year at our Investor Day that fiscal \u201813 to \u201816, we are expecting high single-digit growth in cable OI. And we still are on target to achieve that.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: You\u2019re welcome. Thanks for the questions Ben. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Jason Bazinet with Citi, please go ahead.\nJason Bazinet: Two very quick ones, you mentioned $1.3 billion of buybacks in the quarter and $1.4 billion fiscal year-to-date, was there anything that would cause you to be out of the market or in other words if you are in our shoes do you think we should be moderating our buyback for the quarter. And then second, we have been surprised that the strength in international inbound flights into the Orlando airport particularly in light of the stronger U.S. dollar, do you guys have any hypothesis for why international visitors would be up so much? Thanks.\nJay Rasulo: Okay. On buyback, I guess I will say this I am not going to really give you much guidance on this. But we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders as we have been through dividends and buybacks. You know, this year we announced a very significant increase in our dividend of 34% bringing it up to $1.15 and that happened in this quarter. And I wouldn\u2019t focus too much on the first couple of weeks of this fiscal quarter as an indicator or any kind of guidance as to where we will wind up on the entire fiscal year relative to buyback. So I don\u2019t have any big news for you. Our dividend is almost $2 billion that we paid out in quarter two. And I think you have to look at return to share \u2013 capital return to shareholders in aggregate which is the way we think about it. Your second question on arrivals, so I don\u2019t think that we know or have seen an impact on international arrivals due to exchange rates, I have said for many, many quarters, the overall range of our international business is between 18% and 22% of total attendance at our domestic parks. Q1 is usually on the low end of that range. It was again on the low end of that range this year. And I think that if there is going to be an effect of the varying exchange rates around the world, it will take a while. And if those exchange rates affect the economies from which our international business is sourced, we might see an impact, but as of yet we have not seen that. And actually quarter-to-quarter, year-on-year, there wasn\u2019t a huge change in our international business between fiscal \u201814 and fiscal \u201815.\nJason Bazinet: Thank you very much.\nJay Rasulo: You are welcome.\nLowell Singer: Thanks a lot, Jason. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Anthony DiClemente with Nomura, please go ahead.\nAnthony DiClemente: Thanks very much. I have one question for Jay first and then one for Bob. Jay, on the broadcasting segment, this has been four straight quarters of operating income growth in addition to the rates resurgence at ABC, presumably re-trans and affiliate comp are a big part of that growth. So, I wonder if you would help us with the shape of the trajectory of re-trans or reverse comp over the next 2 or 3 years and maybe even as part of that give us an update as to what you are annualizing on that either in \u201815 or on an annual basis? And then for Bob, just on acquisitions, when Disney first made the acquisition of Maker Studios, you said that you saw it first and foremost as a distribution platform. And at a high level, I was just wondering if you could give us your thoughts on vertical integration or your updated thoughts, particularly vertical integration in digital? How does a more vertically integrated acquisition like Maker compare strategically for you to more horizontal acquisition in content, like Lucas or Marvel? Thanks.\nJay Rasulo: Okay. Let me start with your broadcast question. I am \u2013 we have said in the past that we expected by fiscal \u201815 to be in the $400 million to $500 million range in terms of re-trans, well it\u2019s \u201815 and we are there \u2013 we will be there comfortably, but I am not going to update any further than that. On the overall broadcast business, I think that we have been saying for many, many years that our play in this business is to be the creator and owner of great shows. And those shows payback in the aftermarket when we sell them either to other networks into syndication or increasingly sell them to other distributors. And that\u2019s what you are seeing in our broadcast results this quarter. It is exactly strategically where we want to be in this business. And the fact that we have shows on the network today that are being incredibly well-received have legs and are rating well is a very good indication from where we can be in this business.\nBob Iger: To respond to the question about vertical versus horizontal acquisitions and Maker, first of all, Maker\u2019s results in terms of consumption, number of videos streamed since the time that we bought them has been up substantially, just huge growth. And what that tells us is really what our instinct was when we bought them and that is we were really interested in compelled by substantial increase in consumption of short form video on digital platforms. We had consumption of short form video on our own digital platforms like espn.com, disney.com, ABC, but we didn\u2019t have the kind of traction or the kind of traffic that Maker had. And we thought this would be a great opportunity for us to distribute much more effectively in short form. It also was entr\u00e9e into a world of creativity that we thought we could tap into, particularly when we allow those that are creating in that space access to our franchises and our brands. It was kind of a combination of things. It was just distribution expertise that we did not have as much as we thought we should and certainly production and creative expertise that we thought we could use. And it was I think a unique acquisition opportunity for us, again, given all the growth in short form consumption. I don\u2019t think it necessarily suggests a direction in terms of where we are heading as a company overall. The power of this company largely is in its brands and storytelling and creativity that runs across platforms and is often distributed by third-parties whether they are movie theater owners, big box retailers, or MVPDs to name a few or new platforms like Netflix and Amazon and Hulu. So, I think the primary trust of the company is going to continue to be investing in its brands and its creativity and selling as broadly as we possibly can, but we like being in new space as well. And one last thing as I think this is going to loom larger and larger in terms of Disney\u2019s future and we have touched upon it a little bit earlier today is I think this company needs to focus more on creating a tighter or a closer relationship to its customers for a variety of reasons, not only to mind customer data and usage and obviously create revenue opportunities from that, but to provide customers with experiences that they want in demand basically to be even more user-friendly, more customizable, more personalized. That\u2019s really important in terms of the long-term future of this company. And you will see in various initiatives that are aimed at achieving just that.\nAnthony DiClemente: Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer: Anthony, thank you for the questions. Operator, I think we have time for one more question today.\nOperator: We have David Miller with Topeka Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDavid Miller: Yes, hey guys. Congratulations on the stellar results. Just a couple of offbeat questions. I guess I am going last here, so a few of the obvious questions were taken. Bob, just first of all, I am surprised you didn\u2019t call out the delay in Shanghai. I guess you can\u2019t really call it a delay. Is the sort of postponement of the opening just due to \u2013 you know you want to open this thing kind of coinciding with the Chinese Lunar New Year in the spring or were there other nuances? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks a lot.\nBob Iger: When we signed the contract for Shanghai and when we broke ground, we said publicly that we were targeting the end of 2015 as an opening day targeting, which I think is important. We obviously were embarking on a very large fairly complicated project. One of the largest we have ever engaged in, probably one of the largest ever in China. After we opened, we decided that the opportunity existed in China and specifically in Shanghai to build something even bigger with more attractions and basically more capacity, so that we could handle more guests. And so not only do we design, but we agreed with our partners to build approximately $800 million more in capacity, which obviously added to the scale of what we are building. So, now that we are well into construction and we released a great photo today of the Disneyland Hotel, which gives you an idea how far along we are. We believe that targeting \u2013 the spring actually was more than targeting, we plan to open in the spring of 2016 is much more opportune for us given the size of what we are doing, what we are building and the complexity of it. And given the fact that the weather is better in the spring and as you said, David, it is after the Chinese New Year, where we expect, there would be huge demand and it\u2019s a bit easier to open after that than write before. And I think I might have misspoken and after we broke ground we decided that will build larger, not after we opened. And so we have got a great project unfolding, I was there the week before last and every time I go, I am just amazed at the scale of it and the variety and the uniqueness of this and I continue to believe heavily in the opportunity that we have got to bring a great Disneyland experience to the most populous country in the world. And my enthusiasm has only grown for it, but because we are building something bigger and we like spring versus winter than the spring of \u201816 it is. And we probably will be more specific about an opening date, I am guessing sometime in the middle of this year.\nDavid Miller: Okay. And just a brief question on Inside Out and there is just some mild confusion here at just \u2013 albeit just not that much confusion, but was Inside Out \u2013 and I am just asking out of just personal curiosity, was Inside Out original Disney IP that sort of got transferred over to Pixar and Pixar kind of took it over or was that from the very beginning original Pixar IP that we are going to see next year? Thanks a lot.\nBob Iger: No, that\u2019s Pixar homegrown, actually grown from the mind of the great Pete Docter who directed and created Up and Monsters prior to that. And it comes out in June this year, but no, totally Pixar through and through.\nDavid Miller: Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer: Alright, David, thank you for those questions and thanks again everyone for joining us today.

Bob will lead off followed by Christine and then, of course, we'll be happy to take your questions. So with that, let me turn it over to Bob and we can get started.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon. We just finished a great year, our sixth consecutive year of record results. And since fiscal 2013, we've delivered EPS growth of almost 20%. Fiscal 2016 also included two of the most important achievements in the history of our company: the phenomenal return of Star Wars and the spectacular opening of Shanghai Disney Resort. We're extremely proud of these accomplishments which will drive long-term growth for our company. Star Wars: The Force Awakens exceeded $2 billion in global box office, making it the third highest grossing movie of all-time and we're only just beginning to reap the benefits of our Lucasfilm acquisition. Next up we have Rogue One, a fantastic original Star Wars story, opening in December. Star Wars: Episode VIII will be in theaters December of 2017, followed by a standalone movie about young Han Solo in 2018. And we'll release Episode IX the following year. Work on all those movies is already underway and we're thrilled with what we've seen so far. The magnitude of our Studio's success in fiscal 2016 is simply stunning. We released four films that broke $1 billion in worldwide box office, The Force Awakens, Captain America: Civil War, Finding Dory, and Zootopia. And Jungle Book came very close with $966 million. Our Studio slate topped a record-breaking $7.5 billion in total box office for the year. Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm all contributed to this remarkable achievement, and their creative momentum continues. Doctor Strange just opened to great numbers, Marvel's 14th consecutive movie to open at number one at the U.S. box office. And it has already surpassed $377 million worldwide. Our next animated musical, Moana, is already generating great buzz ahead of its opening later this month. And we expect it will join the pantheon of recent hits from Disney Animation alongside Zootopia and Frozen. Turning to our success in Shanghai, we welcomed four million guests in our first four months of operation, which included the peak summer season. Some of you may infer from this early performance that we could achieve 10 million in attendance in the park's first year, a number we would be thrilled with but we're not providing any annual guidance at this point. I was there last week and the place looks fantastic. It's very clear our guests are thoroughly enjoying it. They're enthusiastically embracing our stories and characters. Classics like Mickey Mouse are fan favorites but they love our new IP, too, like Zootopia. And we recently announced we're already expanding the park with the addition of Toy Story Land. Shanghai Disneyland is now a national tourist destination. More than half our guests come from outside Shanghai and millions of people across China are developing a much greater awareness and affinity for our brand, which will certainly help drive our growth in that huge market over the long term. Turning to Media Networks, ESPN grew in fiscal 2016 and we expect that growth to continue over the long-term. As we saw with the World Series, people love the excitement, the immediacy, and the sheer entertainment of live sports, and ESPN has the richest collection of sports rights in the business, including the NBA, College Football, the College Football Championship, Major League Baseball, College Basketball, and the NFL. Our new NBA deal runs through the 2024-2025 season, securing long-term rights to a sport that continues to grow in popularity. The agreement gives us more inventory and more rights than we've ever had and will serve ESPN very well in the years to come. Maintaining the unequaled scope and quality of ESPN's programming is a top priority, and so is distributing that valuable content as broadly as possible. And we've made significant strides in that direction, particularly when it comes to licensing ESPN's programming to over-the-top distributors. In addition to our deals with Sony and Sling, we've recently closed deals with Hulu as well as AT&T Direct, which features ESPN among the 100 channels offered on the new DirecTV Now service. We believe these new services will ultimately move more Millennials into the pay-TV universe, and we're currently in negotiations with other distributors to further expand our presence on these new platforms. Our recent investment in BAMTech is also targeted at expanding our reach, and we're excited about rolling out our first ESPN-branded content direct to consumers via this platform in 2017. BAMTech is also expanding its business into Europe through a new deal with Discovery. Over the last several years, we've repeatedly expressed our strong belief that our unrivaled portfolio of valuable businesses, brands, and assets gives us the strongest hand and the best strategic position in the media industry. Our sustained performance clearly demonstrates our ability to use the strength of our incredible assets to drive value, and we are extremely confident that we'll continue to deliver significant long-term growth. With modest growth due to some comparability factors that Christine will detail, fiscal 2017 will be an anomaly in our growth trajectory. We fully expect to return to more robust growth in fiscal 2018 and beyond, particularly given the powerful upcoming slates in our Studio. In fiscal 2018 alone, we have four new Marvel movies, three animated films from Pixar and Disney Animation, and two Star Wars releases, including Episode VIII which will also benefit our Consumer Products. We've always managed this company for the long-term and our sustained performance reflects the enduring strength of our strategy, the increasing value of our tremendous brands and franchises, and our unique ability to consistently leverage creative success across our entire company. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Christine to go over the details of our quarter and trends that may impact fiscal 2017. Christine?\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report another solid quarter of financial results which, as Bob said, caps off another great year for our company. Excluding items affecting comparability, earnings per share were $1.10 for the fourth quarter and $5.72 for the full year. We've been able to deliver solid results year after year while maintaining a strong balance sheet which, combined with record operating cash flow of $13.2 billion in fiscal 2016, provides tremendous flexibility to make key investments to expand our existing businesses, capitalize on new growth opportunities, and return capital to our shareholders. Before I discuss our segments' fourth quarter results, I want to remind you that our Q4 results last year included the benefit of an additional week of operations compared to this year. This 53rd week in our fiscal 2015 calendar makes comparisons of our results a little challenging. While there is an element of imprecision in quantifying the impact, we are going to give you our best assessment of how the 53rd week affected key segments and drivers. As we've previously discussed, we estimate the benefit of the 53rd week to our Q4 fiscal 2015 results was approximately $350 million in operating income or about $0.13 in earnings per share, with the majority of the impact at Cable followed by Parks and Resorts and, to a lesser extent, Consumer Products. At Media Networks, we estimate the 53rd week had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income of about 12 percentage points. As a result, operating income was down 8% in the quarter as growth in Broadcasting was more than offset by a decline at Cable. The year-over-year change in Cable operating income was weighed down in Q4 by about 14 percentage points due to the 53rd week, which adversely affected results at ESPN and Disney Channels and led to a 13% decline in Cable operating income for the quarter. Lower results at ESPN were driven by decreases in advertising and affiliate revenue compared to the fourth quarter last year. ESPN's ad revenue was down 13% in the quarter. The year-over-year decline was due to three factors; a significant decrease in daily fantasy advertising, an additional week of ad revenue in Q4 last year, and the impact of ad dollars being diverted to Olympics programming. So far this quarter, ESPN's ad sales are pacing down compared to last year, mostly reflecting the timing of key College Football bowl games. This year, ESPN will air only three of the New Year's Six bowl games during our fiscal Q1 whereas all six games aired during the first fiscal quarter last year. Affiliate revenue was lower in the quarter as higher contractual rates were more than offset by the impact of the 53rd week and a decrease in subscribers. Turning to Broadcasting, operating income was higher in the quarter due to growth in affiliate revenue and higher operating income from program sales partially offset by lower advertising, higher programming costs, and an increase in equity losses. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by higher contractual rates. Higher program sales were driven by sales of Luke Cage and Quantico during the quarter. Programming expenses were up in the quarter as a result of higher costs for network programming, the addition of the Emmy Awards, and higher costs for political news coverage. Ad revenue at the ABC network was adversely impacted by an estimated eight percentage points due to the 53rd week, which was the primary driver of the 5% decline in ad revenue during the fourth quarter. Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC network is running 24% above upfront levels. Turning to affiliate revenue, we estimate the 53rd week and FX had an 8 percentage point adverse impact to Media Networks' affiliate revenue growth, which was down 3% in the quarter. Growth in total Cable affiliate revenue was adversely impacted by 8 percentage points due to the 53rd week and FX, which drove a 5% decline in the quarter. During Q4, we also saw solid growth in Broadcasting affiliate revenue, which once again was up double-digits. At Parks and Resorts, we estimate the 53rd week had a 12 percentage point adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income, which was down 5% in the fourth quarter. Our underlying domestic business had another great quarter. We estimate the 53rd week created a 16 percentage point headwind to growth in operating income, yet growth in OI at our domestic operations was still up 2%. Operating margins at our domestic operations were up 120 basis points compared to Q4 last year, despite an adverse impact of about 120 basis points due to the 53rd week. Attendance at our domestic parks was down 10% in the quarter, reflecting the additional week of operations in Q4 last year. On a comparable fiscal period basis, attendance was down about 3% as higher attendance at Walt Disney World was more than offset by lower attendance at Disneyland, which was comping against a very strong attendance in Q4 2015 during the park's 60th Anniversary celebration. Per capita spending was up 7% on higher admissions and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 1% and occupancy was up over 2 percentage points to 86%. While the underlying performance of our domestic business was quite strong in the quarter, operating income at our international operations was lower driven by about a $100 million decline at Disneyland Paris, partially offset by a positive contribution from a full-quarter of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort. Disneyland Paris continued to experience softness in the quarter due to the lingering effect of terrorism and economic and political uncertainty. While we're disappointed with Disneyland Paris' results in the quarter, we expect to see near-term improvement in connection with the 25th Anniversary celebration which begins in spring 2017. As Bob discussed, we couldn't be more pleased with the launch of Shanghai Disneyland. The financial results for the park's first full quarter of operations were ahead of our expectations. As we look to fiscal 2017, we expect Shanghai Disney Resort to be very close to breakeven for the year. At the Studio, operating income was lower for the fourth quarter compared to Q4 last year due to lower worldwide theatrical results, partially offset by higher operating income from television distribution. Lower theatrical results reflect the performance of Pete's Dragon and Queen of Katwe in the quarter compared to Ant-Man in Q4 last year as well as higher marketing spending for films yet to be released. To put things in perspective, while Q4 results were lower compared to last year, our Studio had a phenomenal year with operating income up 37% to a record $2.7 billion. At Consumer Products & Interactive Media, we estimate the 53rd week, which weighed on our licensing results, had an adverse impact on segment operating income of about 9 percentage points. As a result, segment operating income declined by 5% due to lower results in our licensing and games businesses. While we continued to see strong sales of Finding Dory merchandise in the fourth quarter, this was more than offset by strong sales of Frozen merchandise in Q4 last year. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased about 16.6 million shares for $1.6 billion. And for the full year, we repurchased about 73.8 million shares for $7.5 billion. So far this quarter, we've repurchased 6.1 million shares for approximately $560 million and we expect to repurchase between $7 billion and $8 billion for the year. As we look to fiscal 2017, we expect to deliver modest EPS growth for the year due to some comparability factors. Let's start with Cable where we expect fiscal 2017 programming costs to be up about 8% versus fiscal 2016, driven primarily by the first year of our new NBA contract, which accounts for $600 million of that increase. Our Parks and Resorts segment is positioned for continued growth in 2017 due in part to the opening of Avatar Land at Walt Disney World and a full year of results from Shanghai Disney Resort. There are three parks comparability items I'd like to mention. First, Hurricane Matthew disrupted our operations at Walt Disney World in early October, which resulted in the closure of our parks for about a day and a half. We estimate the impact of the hurricane on Q1 operating income to be approximately $40 million. Second, due to the impact of Hurricane Matthew and the conversion of rooms at Wilderness Lodge to Vacation Club units, Q1 total domestic resort reservations are pacing down about 2% while booked rates are pacing up 3%. And third, I'd like to point out that one week of the winter holiday period will fall in Q2, whereas the entire holiday fell in Q1 last year. As a result, this will shift about $20 million of OI from Q1 into Q2. Turning to the Studio, Bob discussed the strength of our slate in Q1 and it's worth mentioning we will also release Beauty and the Beast, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the fifth installment of Pirates of the Caribbean, and Cars 3 during the year. While we remain thrilled with our Studio business and the great films we have in the pipeline, I'll remind everyone that results in fiscal 2017 will comp against a record-breaking 2016, due in part to the phenomenal success of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. At Consumer Products & Interactive Media, while we expect operating income growth for the full year, we expect OI to be down more than 20% in the first quarter due to the strength of Star Wars and Frozen merchandise licensing and our licensed Star Wars Battlefront game in Q1 last year. And finally, results in fiscal 2017 will be adversely impacted by about $175 million due to FX rates and higher pension expense. Also, in terms of net interest expense, the $100 million you saw in the fourth quarter represents a reasonable quarterly run rate for the year. We're very pleased with our fiscal 2016 results which once again demonstrate that our strategy of investing in high-quality, branded content, coupled with great execution and a balanced approach to capital allocation continues to generate solid earnings growth. Once again, we expect to deliver modest earnings growth in fiscal 2017 and, as Bob said, we feel extremely confident that we'll return to more robust earnings growth in fiscal 2018 and beyond. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell for Q&A.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Company: Okay. Thanks, operator. We are ready to take the first question.\nOperator: And our first question is from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Thanks. I have one for Bob and one for Christine. Bob, on ESPN, you guys have been clear about 2017 step-up. You've been clear that ESPN will not grow at the rate it used to grow the previous decade. And you've been clear that you expect growth in the future. I think on those points, everyone agrees first and second. But on the third point, the question is, what can you share with us that gives you the confidence about the growth in the future? Is it an affiliate fee cycle? Is it new subscriber growth? Advertising costs? So anything to give us some sense of why you're so confident about the outlook.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Well, I think you have to start with what ESPN offers and its popularity. I mentioned in my comments the popularity and there is certainly recent examples, like the World Series, of live sports, so I feel really good about their programming. I feel good about their continued ability to drive solid advertising. We have a good sense of what their rate structure is in terms of existing deals with distributors, but we have some opportunities and some new deals to improve the rate structure even more. We have taken a more bullish position on the future of ESPN's sub base. We think that while we were candid a year ago on sub losses, we believe that, to some extent, the causes of those losses have abated, notably the migration to smaller packages. But we also believe that new entrance in the marketplace, particularly DMVDs \u2013 digital MVPDs, I should say, are going to offer ESPN opportunities that they haven't had before to reach more people, and in particular we think those offerings because of their pricing, the user interface, their mobile-friendly nature, are likely to cause more Millennials to either stay in the multi-channel ecosystem as subscribers or to enter it when they might not have in the past. So we just generally feel bullish about ESPN's future. We are, I'd say, realistic about what we've seen with recent sub trends and again have been, I think, fairly candid about that and we think the long-term prospects for the reason I cited for ESPN are good. The other thing that ESPN has, which we've talked about a lot, is the ability to take product out direct to consumer and that's why we invested in BAM. And we think that gives us a really interesting opportunity to create a new product, it gives us an interesting opportunity to create product that is more user-friendly and, therefore, is likely to gain more consumption, and it gives us an ability to mine data from that user consumption that can approve our advertising prospects and give us the ability to tailor the product in a more customized way for those consumers.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Okay. Thanks, Bob. And then for Christine, I think most folks who have covered the company for a long time expected Shanghai to look like other parks that open with big losses. So what's different about Shanghai? Why is it going to get close to breakeven a year into operation than maybe some of the other international parks?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: I'll take the first part of that. Christine may want to address a little bit from a financial perspective. But this has opened very successfully, very successfully. And I mentioned two things in my earlier comments; one, just the sheer number of people that have come in, but we also have a fair amount of data already about guest satisfaction. We know that consumers are staying longer, obviously that's the result of them liking it. And the other thing that's really interesting to us is what a national product this has become. We expected that attendance would be primarily from the Shanghai area, at least in the early months and maybe couple of years as word-of-mouth spread across the country, but the fact that 50% of attendance already is from outside of Shanghai tells us that this is a product that's resonating across China. And obviously, given the population base that China represents, that bodes very well for us. So the product is working, people are coming, they're staying longer. We like the trends that we're seeing generally about spending. Our hotel occupancy is extremely high. We didn't get into details there, but I can tell you that it's very, very high off the bat. We've already made a decision about expansion and that's already begun. And so, our outlook for this \u2013 and what we even see happening in 2017, is quite positive.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Yeah, Michael, I'd add to that that the first quarter of full operations, which we just concluded, exceeded our expectations. We've got a very established team over there, established in the sense that they've worked in the theme park for a while. They're very nimble and they can adjust to findings that they are encountering along the way, and we're very optimistic that what we gave you for the fiscal 2017 expectation of around a break-even result is certainly something that we're looking forward to.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Okay. Thanks.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Company: Michael, thank you. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Just staying on the parks for a minute, we've seen such impressive growth over the last several years both in terms of revenue and margins, really all metrics. I know there's been benefit from the expansions, the MyMagic+ as well as, obviously, the usual organic drivers. I guess looking forward, when we look for the incremental growth over the next several years, is it a higher contribution from Shanghai given what you've just said or is there something else that's going to be incremental? I guess, any color you can give us to better frame how this impressive growth can continue.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Well, first of all, we believe we still have pricing leverage and that's not just from raising prices on your standard ticket, it's from creating new packages, and we certainly have seen that in the last year, which was designed to do a few things. One, obviously when we put in more demand-oriented pricing, we're able to move some of the attendance away from the peak period and improve the guest satisfaction. But we believe that there are a number of tools we have available to us on the revenue yield management side, to create more revenue out of the attendance that we're getting. We also have other kinds of expansion opportunities, like hotels, for instance, where not only do we have the property but we've seen such high occupancy rates in Orlando and in California that we believe that it would be smart for us to build more hotels out \u2013 we have no announcements to make per se, but build more hotels out at both sites and take advantage of what we're seeing there. That clearly is very beneficial to us. And then we've only just begun to mine some of the critical IP that we have created in the last few years, Star Wars being the biggest one. We're building two of the biggest lands we've ever built in Orlando and in California. And we think that \u2013 I know you talked about what we've done already, but there's so much more that we can do, and so much more we are doing. And I think usually when we talk about the Studio, we talk about the Studio results as it relates to box office and the bottom-line for that business, but you also have to think about it in terms of how we mine these assets not just in the United States, but globally at our Parks and in Consumer Products. I was in Shanghai last week and it was just thrilling to see the reaction people are having to those franchises. We had 11 franchises of Consumer Products last year that did $1 billion or more in global retail sales. But you really see that resonating when you go to the theme parks. And not just Mickey Mouse and core characters and Pirates and things you'd expect, but the line for characters from Zootopia in Shanghai was significant. So I think there \u2013 and we're at a time in that product cycle that the ability to increase profitability from it is really just kicking in.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And then if I can just sneak in another one quickly. On the sports side, I'd love to hear your comments, the ratings have been very mixed lately, some franchises showing record viewership \u2013 you cited the World Series. Others, like the NFL, being in a bit of a slump. I would love to hear your view on how much of this volatility you think is cyclical? Or do you see any sort of permanent changes in viewership that may give you a different view of these franchises at this point?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Well, we've seen some of the numbers from the NFL as well. I actually think that there's kind of a lot of premature speculation there. I'm not \u2013 I don't want to make light of it, except I do want to say this is a season, and it happens to be a season that's occurred when postseason baseball was very strong, and clearly the election had some impact, certainly the debates did. So I think it's a little too soon to jump to conclusions. We're being patient about it. We're going to look at the trend lines and see and continue to watch it, but I think it would be \u2013 it's far too early for us to suggest that we're concerned. It's still the highest rated sports programming that's out there, and we think we're lucky that we've got it licensed on a long-term basis. Look, it's clear also, the most important thing the NFL can do is to maintain quality. And it just could be that what we're seeing among the contributors is that the match-ups or the strength of certain teams, particularly some of the teams that have done extremely well in the past, is not what it was, and that could just be aberrational. So we'd love to see the ratings higher, but we're not expressing long-term concern about it on a long-term basis.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Company: Alexia, thanks for the questions. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. I hope you can hear me; I'm trying to take out the slack (30:06).\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: We can hear you.\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you. There's been tons of speculation on potential acquisitions, notably potentially Netflix, Twitter. Can you talk about, like, just generally, what you think is missing at Walt Disney? What acquisitions would fill a hole for you? And then I have a follow-up.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Well, obviously we're not going to get specific about that. But we think there's some really interesting opportunities, given what's going on from a technological perspective, to both improve our businesses and also improve the consumer experience by selling directly to consumers. I mentioned that earlier. And we're considering and exploring various ways to accomplish this. We think it's something that's important for us to do. I'll go back to BAM. The purchase of BAM was designed just to do just that. Whether there will be more or not, I can't really say. Except to say that we're obviously interested in the opportunity that exist today to have more direct relationship with the consumer for the reasons that I cited.\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And then, Bob, could you \u2013 again it's kind of an awkward question, but you've stated the time that you plan to leave. Can you talk a little bit about your succession planning and how you're thinking about that?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Yeah, it's not awkward at all. The board has discussed succession at every meeting that the board has had in the last few years, and I don't think there's necessarily a need for the board to provide any more details publicly about the process, except to say the process is ongoing, it's robust, and we're all confident that it's going to result in the board choosing not only the right candidate, but the right candidate on a timely basis.\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Company: All right, Jessica. Thanks for the questions. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: And we have a question from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nTodd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Todd Juenger here. A quick one for Christine and then maybe a little follow-on for Bob. Christine, just on the Asian park attendance \u2013 or, doesn't have to be you, but probably you, Christine \u2013 especially with Bob's comments about the strength of the start, just wondering across all of China, can you talk about whether there's any impact at all that you see between the attendance at Hong Kong and the attendance in Shanghai, whether there's any interrelation there or even cannibalization? And at Shanghai, now that schools are open, I assume, in China, is there any difference in the attendance profile during times of school period? And then the broader question \u2013 this is really a pickup, right, from what Jessica said, so sorry if it's \u2013 I hope it's not redundant. It's not to me. Bob, I just picked up a line that you said in your opening comments in the press release around further strengthening your technological capabilities. You've talked about that a little bit, but I haven't seen that statement before in the opening line of the press release. I'm just wondering what types of technological capabilities you are thinking about that needs strengthening and what are some different ways to strengthen them. Is that mostly about the BAMTech type of stuff or is there other stuff going on? Thanks. Sorry for the windy question.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: First of all, by using the term strengthening, I'm not in any way implying that we are weak. It just means that there are opportunities for us to get stronger. Let's use the parks as an example on what we're doing at Imagineering, where there's significant investment in new technology to improve the guest experience. And that, by the way, includes how guests buy access to our parks, the whole online sale or e-commerce experience. As a for instance, we're redoing disneystore.com using basically better technological tools. Another example, BAM clearly was what I was mostly referring to because that is an investment in a technology platform aimed at strengthening our technology capabilities so that we can strengthen our business. On the parks question that you asked, we haven't seen a negative impact at Hong Kong due to Shanghai at all. In fact, there was some uptick initially on Hong Kong attendance when Shanghai opened. And there seems to be an interesting growth in pride locally in Hong Kong in that park. I guess their competitive spirits have somehow or another been stimulated. In terms of what we're seeing in Shanghai attendance-wise and the makeup of the visitor weekday or post-summer, it's really kind of too early to tell. I will say, having been there last week on two weekdays, I was surprised at how many kids were in the park. They were younger kids, but there were many more of them of what we expected. And we are seeing some interesting patterns already with visitation. I cited one just in terms of where we're sourcing visitors geographically. I don't want to get into too many of the others yet because we're only four months in, but the strength of certain days of the week that we didn't expect and some days of the week are slightly less strong than we thought initially. But so far, I can say so good, meaning we really are happy with how this product has launched. Another thing that I haven't really addressed here, but one of the things that we wanted to be incredibly sensitive about and be really good at was the whole notion of entering a new market with this product under, what I'll call, culturally sensitive or culturally correct circumstances, opening something that the people of China actually that resonated with them in terms of their experience, and that has been letter-perfect.\nTodd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Company: Todd, thank you for those questions. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Doug Mitchelson from UBS. Please go ahead.\nDoug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC: Oh, thanks so much. One for Bob, one for Christine. So, Bob, I guess it's not an easy one but do you just see the change in the power structure in Washington having an impact on The Walt Disney Company at all, positively or negatively? And I'll just ask the question for Christine. You outlined another aggressive year of share repurchases and I was hoping you could offer your latest thoughts on optimizing buybacks versus dividends and debt leverage? Thanks.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: I think it's really too early to speculate about what the changes in Washington are going to mean for our business or for businesses. We have, though, been exhorting Washington both the executive and the legislative branches to take a look at the current tax policy of the United States, particularly the corporate tax rate, and to close more loopholes but lower the corporate tax rate. We are no longer competitive with the rest of the world in that regard and that must be addressed. It's possible that, given what's gone on this week, that that's likely to be addressed sooner rather than later. That's obviously a good thing. It's also a good thing I think for the market and for most businesses that the transition is already off to what appears to be a fairly smooth start, meaning it looks like there's cordiality, which we've not seen in a long time, and there's an attempt by both sides, the incumbent and the President-elect, to approach this in a rational, cordial \u2013 I guess, the best way to \u2013 effective and polite way. That can only be good for business and for the country. And I think smooth transitions are good. I will say on the smooth transition front, we're going through a smooth transition as well. We've already prepared a bust of President-elect Trump to go into our Hall of the Presidents at Disney World.\nDoug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you for that.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay. Doug, on buybacks, as you know, in fiscal 2016 we bought back $7.5 billion of our stock this year. We gave you $7 billion to $8 billion for 2017. And I think you know we have a very balanced approach to addressing return of capital to shareholders. We also considered dividends but that's after we invest in our businesses and look at other growth opportunities. I think you'll also noted in my comments that I called out a record year for cash flow from operations at $13.2 billion. So we have a lot to work with. And once again, we invest in our existing businesses, look for other opportunities, and of course always keep shareholders in mind.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: And by the way just to add to what Christine said, we had record years in fiscal 2014 and 2015, really strong years, and 2016 had great growth but a little bit more modest than the two years prior, to deliver from operations $13 billion-plus of cash is quite an extraordinary performance.\nDoug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Company: Doug, thank you for those questions. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Omar Sheikh from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nOmar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. I have a couple of questions. First of all, Bob, on BAMTech, going back to that. I wondered if you could just maybe just give us a sense of how big of an investment you think you need to put into that effort in fiscal 2017 so you obviously talked about needing to get close to the consumer and that seems to be the only projects you have that we know about. So maybe if you could maybe give us a sense of how much you need to put behind that. That's the first question. And then second one maybe for Christine is on Consumer Products, if I could switch to that. You give us some guidance I think you said for Q1 OI. I wondered maybe if you could give us a little bit of sense of how you expect 2017 overall to pan out. I'm particularly thinking about the licensing revenues and the trends you might see there. Thank you.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Omar, on the BAMTech side, the investment that we're thinking about in terms of launching new product is very, very modest. The primary investment is in buying the 33% stake in BAMTech that we're buying initially. We do plan, as I mentioned in my comments, to launch an ESPN branded service in 2017, but we've already licensed enough sports to put onto that service so that the incremental cost from a programming perspective would be de minimis. And the technologies we've talked about already exist to do what we want to do and so you're not looking really at a significant investment to accomplish near-term what we need to accomplish there.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Hi, Omar. On Consumer Products, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we do expect growth for the year in the segment. While I did note a challenging first quarter operating income performance, once again that is going to be primarily due to the difficult comp we have last year to Star Wars and, as you remember, last year we also had the fourth quarter revenue recognized in our first quarter, so it made it even a little more challenging than just a straight quarter. But, year-over-year, we expect there to be growth in that segment. We also \u2013 last quarter, I got a question on Frozen comparisons, and I just want to mention it because it still is trickling through in our results. But we did see difficult comps for the phenomenal performance that we had in Frozen, and we saw those in fiscal 2016 in the second, third, and fourth quarter, and we still expect to have difficult comps for Frozen merchandise throughout 2017.\nOmar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Great. And then it's just the Cars launch in the middle of next year that you expect to see some sort of reacceleration on the top-line there. Would you say that's correct?\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Absolutely. Cars is one of those evergreen franchises that has been very successful in Consumer Products, also throughout our \u2013 it's also represented in our Parks, as you know, through Cars Land in Anaheim. And also this year we have the movie Spiderman. It's not our movie to release, but our Consumer Products will represent the strength in that franchise as well.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: And Marvel is producing that movie.\nOmar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Company: Thanks, Omar. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: And we have a question from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Bob, I just want to go back to your comments about the pay-TV universe and your enthusiasm for the new emerging bundles. Any comments you could share with us on Hulu, given your position as an owner of that company, what the product may look like? And sort of any color on why you think that may expand the pie? And any role BAMTech may fill for you, in also addressing that broadband-only universe with ESPN? And then, Christine, I just wanted to go back to your prepared remarks on Cable. I think if I adjust out the 53rd week, I'm looking at, like, 3% Cable affiliate revenue growth. I think you said down 8% \u2013 an 8% hit from 53rd week down 5% reported. I just wanted to make sure I got all that right. I was jotting it down quickly. So, thanks.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Hulu is, at some point, going to go public with far more details about its product, the user interface, the pricing, and I guess ultimately the programming that it's licensed, although some of it has already come out. So I can't really add much except to say that between what Hulu is doing, what Sling has done, what AT&T Direct is doing, what others are doing that we're already in negotiation with, we believe that you're going to see a number of different packages brought out, meaning different prices, different bundles. In all cases, we believe the user interface and the technology is going to be very contemporary and will be very mobile-friendly. And we think, given the pricing and the nature of the product that is coming out, that the opportunity to either keep Millennials in as subscribers, or to attract them, meaning cause them to subscribe earlier than they may have, is actually very encouraging. And that's one of the reasons why we're more bullish about the future of multi-channel TV than perhaps either the marketplace or others are. It doesn't mean there isn't going to be a shift either away from the giant expanded basic bundle, or away from some of the traditional distributors. But we believe that there will be plenty of other opportunities. The other thing that we have to note, which we've said before is these new entrants in the marketplace are very, very interested in distributing our product. They know the popularity of sports, and in particular ESPN, and they know that it is in their best interest to license that product to launch their service more effectively. We've seen that time after time after time, negotiation after negotiation, and the pricing to us is also good.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just as a follow up, where's your head on a direct-to-consumer ESPN, either leveraging BAMTech or on your own? Is that still being deliberated, or have you moved to the point of thinking more seriously about that?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: We're taking it seriously. It's not something I think we need to deliberate about. I think if the opportunity exists, or if the need exists, or both, we will take advantage of it, meaning we have the technology now through BAMTech to accomplish exactly what we would need to accomplish, and we're probably more likely to be aggressive about it than non-aggressive, but the need doesn't exist at the moment. And we're going to give a lot of these new products that are launching a chance to prove what we believe is the case, and that is they're going to be considered attractive to the marketplace and, therefore, deliver value to us on a timely basis.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Makes sense.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Hi, Ben. It's Christine.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, Christine.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: So thanks for asking the question on affiliate revenue, and I know my comments were a little laden in some 53rd week information, so thanks for the opportunity to hopefully clarify. So on Cable affiliate revenue, the actual was down 5%, the 53rd week was 8%, for a net of 3%, as you noted. For Media Networks affiliate revenue \u2013 and the reason I'm saying this is, the numbers are close but they're flipped. It's down 3%, with the same 8% adjustment, for a 5% growth. Now, as you know, we'll be filing our 10-K in a couple of weeks which will provide the affiliate revenue growth drivers for the full year, but let me give you some context now on Q4 affiliate growth. So the 53rd week was a 7 point drag on the Q4 affiliate revenue growth. Rates were a 6 point benefit to that Q4 affiliate growth. Subs were a 2 point drag in the quarter, which is consistent with what we saw last quarter and consistent with what you'll see in the 10-K as the full year impact of subscriber declines. And also, lastly, foreign exchange was a 1 point drag on that quarterly growth.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Was that Cable, Christine, or Media Net? Sorry to...\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: That was Media Networks.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks so much for all the help.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Company: Okay. Ben. Thank you. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: And we have a question from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nKannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. So, just a couple of follow-ups on that. Recently there was this dispute between Nielsen and Disney, it looked like, on the numbers itself. If you could just help us understand what the differences were in terms of the way those numbers were being arrived at? And secondly, from a balance sheet perspective, how sacrosanct is the kind of leverage levels you look at in case something interesting in size does come along from an M&A perspective? How do you guys view your balance sheet flexibility from that perspective? Thanks.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Thank you, Kannan. We thought the Nielsen numbers when they were released \u2013 we continue to think this, by the way \u2013 are an anomaly in terms of what the industry overall is seeing. And further they contradicted what other respected third-party observers and experts had been saying and telling us. So we've exhorted Nielsen to take a very careful look at basically their methodology. They're obviously an important business to us because of the service they provide, particularly on the advertising side, but given the fact that what they provided was an anomaly and given the fact that it contradicted what other observers were seeing, we think it's important that more scrutiny is given to it. In addition to that, Nielsen is currently not measuring digital subs. We've talked to them about the need to do that and they've talked about doing it but we believe given the growth in these digital platforms that needs to happen on a much more timely faster basis than it has been happening. That's basically I think is it in a nutshell.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: And, Kannan, on the balance sheet and your comments on leverage, so we ended the year with total leverage about 1.1 times. So, we view \u2013 and I said it in my comments, and we said it consistently, we view our balance sheet as a source of strength and great financial flexibility. So that's the way we treat it. There's nothing sacrosanct about it. But we do treat it as a valuable financial flexible tool and we will deal with things as they come along.\nKannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Company: Kannan, thanks for the questions. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: And we have a question from Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Please go ahead.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thanks very much. I have two questions. One for Bob and one for Christine. So, Bob, on the subject of direct to consumer and getting closer to the consumer, I want to ask about Disney content as a direct to consumer service sort of outside of ESPN. So you have in the U.K. I believe DisneyLife, which you've talked about in the past. When do we see something like that Disney as a service, so to speak, back in U.S., so direct-to-consumer Disney branded apps here stateside? And then Christine, just you mentioned Cable programming costs up 8% in fiscal 2017. I was curious, does that include the expectation for a step-up in the Big Ten costs for renewal there? I think that's up for renewal during the year. Correct me if I'm wrong. Thank you.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: I think there's an inevitability to us bringing a Disney-branded product out in the United States, but I'm not prepared to discuss timing yet. One of the reasons is that we're still learning about the product in the U.K. We're still considering its pricing, the nature of the product, the user interface, the manner in which it's distributed. And we want to learn as much as we possibly can, which is what that was designed to do before we bring it out in any other market. But we do know that, to those that have used it, it's quite popular. And we think there's an opportunity here, but we're not prepared to say when.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: And on programming expenses, Anthony. Yes, the Cable programming expenses are estimated to be up 8% for the year. We talked about the NBA contract driving $600 million of that increase. The Big Ten, we don't have a deal with currently. So we'd love to be in business with the Big Ten long-term, but we don't have a deal currently to announce.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: So if you were to have a deal, it would be a greater step-up in programming costs, just to clarify?\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: We're not going to comment on specifics, but the 8% is what we've given publicly.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Company: Thanks, Anthony. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: And we have a question from Michael Morris from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\nMichael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Thank you. Good evening. Two questions. Bob, you talked a little bit about the regulatory environment previously, but I'm curious specifically about your position on net neutrality. How important is the current policy to your business both the existing business, also strategy? How do you think about things going forward? And how could that impact you if it were removed as policy? And then second on the BAMTech partnership with Discovery in Europe. I'm curious since ESPN seemed to move away from European exposure, why do you think Eurosport and Discovery can succeed were ESPN kind of pulled back? Thanks.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Interesting, we used to own as a company a good piece of Eurosport, and we divested a long time ago. I think to me answer that part of the question first, we think it's better because they were already in the market successfully, and we would be a new entrant with ESPN. And so, this made sense for us. On the first part, we really haven't been vocal about net neutrality. I think it would be safe to say right now, not even sure we have a strong, a big oar in the water, so to speak. And so, we don't really have a public position to take on it. Frankly, it's not something that has even been discussed with me in the very recent past. So I'm caught mildly by surprise by it. But I think one of the reasons it hasn't been discussed is it hasn't been of issue to us.\nMichael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Great.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Company: All right, Mike, thanks. Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: And we have a question from Jason Bazinet from Citi. Please go ahead.\nJason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): A question for Ms. McCarthy. You talked about the $175 million FX hit for fiscal 2017. Is that independent of any currency moves intra-year because of your hedges?\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: So that $175 million, Jason, is both the year-over-year impact of foreign exchange as well as pension expense.\nJason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: The way you should look at our foreign exchange for fiscal 2017 is that we are fully hedged, so the number that we've given which is a combined number, but if you want to disaggregate it a little bit, and I'm happy to do that. It's a little over $100 million for foreign exchange with the balance being in pension expense.\nJason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: In the recent moves, by the way, in currencies have not impacted us because we are fully hedged.\nJason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Company: All right, Jason, thank you, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.

Please note that this conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the call over to Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Good afternoon, and welcome to The Walt Disney Co.'s Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. We issued two press releases about 45 minutes ago and they are both available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and a recording and a transcript will be available on our website as well. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob will lead off, followed by Christine, and then, of course, we'll be happy to take your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob and we can get started.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm happy to report that Disney had another strong quarter, with adjusted earnings per share of 12% in Q3 to $1.62. This is our 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. This quarter's results are continued evidence that The Walt Disney Co.'s asset mix, especially our brands and franchises, is strong, as is our ability to execute in brand-enhancing and value-creating ways. We're thrilled with our performance and energized by the great hand of intellectual property and talent that we currently have. But we are also very focused on challenges and opportunities as the media world continues to evolve and change. As we look at our businesses and the marketplace, two things are clear. The multichannel bundle delivers the most value to us and remains a great value proposition to consumers. Therefore, our top priority is to support it and to do what we can to maintain or enhance its value to customers. We also know that new platforms and new entrance in the digital video space are offering consumers more flexibility in variety with exciting new products and impressive user experiences. And we must create or take advantage of these new opportunities in ways that are complementary to the multichannel offering. With that in mind, earlier today, we announced a significant investment that provides us the technology infrastructure to quickly scale and monetize our streaming capabilities at ESPN and across our entire company. We're acquiring a 33% stake in BAM Tech, the industry leader in video streaming, data analytics and commerce management. We have the option to acquire majority ownership in the future, and through this investment, we plan to launch a new direct-to-consumer ESPN-branded, multi-sports subscription streaming service. Like many others, we're very impressed with the BAM Tech platform and investing and joining forces with the BAM Tech team will enable us to make a major leap into the direct-to-consumer video space and will also provide countless new opportunities to expand into this space as the marketplace evolves. Our goal is to ensure that our brands, notably ESPN, remain strong, vital and relevant in a totally changed media landscape. BAM Tech is a critical component of this strategy, and the specifics of our investment are provided in our press release about the deal. We continue to work with a wide range of distributors to make our content accessible to consumers in more ways than ever. And I'm pleased to announce that AT&T DirecTV, the largest distributor in the country, will feature ESPN, ESPN2, ABC, Freeform, Disney Channel, Disney XD and Disney Junior in all subscription packages offered in its upcoming DirecTV Now OTT service. A few other notes about ESPN: we just had one of the most exciting and successful NBA finals ever. As we begin a new contractual term with the NBA, we're enthusiastic about our expanded rights package for a sport that continues to grow in popularity. ESPN also recently announced a new arrangement with the ACC and starting this month, ESPN subscribers can stream more than 600 exclusive live ACC events through ACC Network Extra on ESPN3, WatchESPN and the ESPN app. And in 2019, we will launch a dedicated linear channel covering All Things ACC. Turning to another area of significant investment for the future, our grand opening of Shanghai Disney Resort was a spectacular success by any measure. More than 70 million people in China watched the opening ceremony live on television or digital streaming. And after working on this project for more than 17 years, I can't even begin to tell you how thrilling it was to see the park come alive with people who were all having a fantastic time. We've welcomed well over a million guests since we officially opened the gates on June 16 and their reaction has been everything we'd hoped for and more. Ticket sales are strong. People are staying in the park longer than we ever imagined they would, and hotel occupancy is holding steady at 95%. Guest feedback is overwhelmingly positive and people are sharing their experiences widely on social media. So guests are now coming to the park with a better understanding of what to expect and how to have the most fun while they're there. And we have every reason to expect the excitement and enthusiasm will continue. In Shanghai, awareness of our park is virtually universal and intent to visit is extremely high. It's obviously far too early to identify trends and make forecasts or projections, but Shanghai Disney Resort is clearly off to a strong start. Before the gates even opened, we were already planning for the future. Our first expansion is now under construction and we have plenty of room to add new lands, attractions, hotels and more. Before I turn the call over to Christine, I want to note that our Studio is having an absolutely phenomenal year so far, continuing a decade of stunning achievement. Since our 2006 acquisition of Pixar, we've released 29 films under the Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and Disney Animation banners. The average global box office for these movies is about $800 million. 29 films with an average box office of almost $800 million is an astonishing achievement and further testament to our dedication to quality as well as the immense talent of our Studio team and their ability to execute at the highest level. And the box office performance is only part of the equation. We generate substantial added value from these great films across consumer products, television and parks and resorts. And we have plenty of great new movies in the pipeline, with the releases scheduled well into the next decade. Today, I'd like to briefly mention three major releases still to come in calendar 2016. Moana, Marvel's Doctor Strange and Rogue One. Moana is an animated musical comedy fantasy adventure. In other words, another great movie from Disney Animation. In addition to great storytelling and an extraordinary cast, Moana also features original music from Hamilton's Lin-Manuel Miranda and it will be in theaters at Thanksgiving. Moana follows an incredibly impressive run of films from Disney Animation, including Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, Big Hero 6 and Zootopia. On the Marvel front, the November release of Doctor Strange marks the debut of another incredible character in the Marvel cinematic universe. Judging from the reaction to the cast and the trailer we showed at Comic-Con, fans are as excited about this movie as we are. Actually, fans were pretty excited about everything Marvel shared with them. They've got a lot of great movies to look forward to. We're also thrilled by the way Star Wars fans are embracing Rogue One, our first stand-alone Star Wars movie telling a story outside the epic saga. We shared some exclusive footage at the Star Wars celebration event in London last month and the reaction was unbelievable. The level of fan enthusiasm we're seeing for Rogue One is roughly on par with what we saw for The Force Awakens at similar points in the marketing campaign. For example, views for the first Rogue One trailer were about even with the first trailer for The Force Awakens when it debuted, which tells us there's a lot of interest and growing excitement about this movie. We've also just finished filming Star Wars: Episode VIII, we've begun production on Episode IX and work on two more stand-alone movies is well underway. This kind of great storytelling will always be our first priority, but bringing great stories to consumers in innovative ways is a very close second. So even as we continue to invest for growth, as we have with Shanghai Disney Resort, we're also aggressively investing for change with BAM Tech being the latest example. We'll continue to use the strength of our incomparable brands, Disney, Pixar, Marvel, ESPN, ABC and Lucasfilm, as well as our coveted content to lead the way forward, driving change and creating value. Now, I'm going to turn the call over to Christine to share the details of our Q3 results. Christine?\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report the company delivered another quarter of strong financial results. Total revenue for the third fiscal quarter was up 9%, compared to prior year, and earnings per share, excluding items affecting comparability, were up 12% to $1.62. Our Studio continues to enjoy unprecedented creative success, which has driven tremendous results at the box office and record financial performance. This calendar year we've already set new industry records by reaching $2 billion in domestic box office and $5 billion in global box office faster than any studio in history. Disney holds four of the top five domestic releases so far in calendar 2016, including Finding Dory, which is number one with $475 million, and the top four global releases with Captain America: Civil War at approximately $1.2 billion, Zootopia at over $1 billion, The Jungle Book at $940 million, and Finding Dory at $875 million. All of these films were incredibly well reviewed, which is a testament to the creative excellence and incredible execution of the teams behind these films. The creative and financial success of our Studio is truly unprecedented, which was evident once again during the third quarter. Studio operating income was $766 million, over 60% higher than in third quarter last year, and was driven by increases in worldwide theatrical and worldwide home entertainment results. Higher theatrical results reflect the strong performances of Captain America: Civil War, The Jungle Book, Finding Dory and Zootopia, and higher home entertainment results were driven primarily by strong sales of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Zootopia. The Studio segment has generated $2.3 billion in operating income during the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, which has already surpassed the record full year results the Studio delivered during all of fiscal 2015. Parks and Resorts had another great quarter as segment revenue and operating income set all-time records. These results are particularly notable given the quarter was negatively impacted by both the timing of the Easter holiday period, which fell in our fiscal second quarter this year, compared to our fiscal third quarter last year, as well as significant pre-opening costs at Shanghai Disney Resort. This quarter also marks the 21st consecutive year-over-year growth in operating income, which is evidence that our Parks and Resorts business, particularly on the domestic side, is operating at a high level and continues to benefit from key investments supporting world-class intellectual properties, successful execution and prudent cost management. Operating income at our domestic operations was up over 20% in the quarter and margins were higher by about 400 basis points, driven by continued growth in Domestic Parks and Disney Cruise Line. Attendance at our Domestic Parks was down 4% in the third quarter, with most of that decline due to the adverse impact of the shift in the Easter holiday period. The impact from lower domestic attendance was more than offset by the impact of strong per capita spending, which was up 8% on higher admissions and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was down slightly. However, occupancy was 3 percentage points higher at 90%. Domestic resort reservations for the fourth quarter, excluding the 53rd week in Q4 of fiscal 2015, are pacing up 1%, compared to prior-year levels, while booked rates are pacing up 2%. Growth in domestic operations was partially offset by a decline at our international parks, due primarily to preopening spending at Shanghai Disney Resort, which opened toward the end of the third quarter. As Bob mentioned, we are incredibly pleased with the opening of Shanghai Disney Resort. At our other international parks, operating income was lower at Disneyland Paris, but we saw improved results at Hong Kong Disneyland. Turning to Media Networks, operating income in the third quarter was comparable to Q3 last year, as modest growth in cable was offset by a decline at broadcasting. At cable, we saw nice operating income growth at ESPN, driven by higher affiliate and advertising revenue. Growth in affiliate revenue at ESPN resulted from increases in contractual rates, partially offset by a decline in subscribers and unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. ESPN ad revenue was up 5% in the third quarter, driven by an increase in units sold. So far this quarter, ESPN cash ad sales are pacing down, compared to prior year. The lower ad sales pacing reflects a difficult comp versus Q4 last year, which included an extra week. Also, as expected, we're seeing some impact in the quarter from the presence of the Olympics. Disney Channels generated lower income from program sales, compared to Q3 last year, which was partially offset by higher affiliate revenue. Cable equity income was down in the quarter due primarily to lower income from our investment in A&E. Broadcasting operating income was down in the third quarter, as growth in affiliate revenue and higher income from program sales were more than offset by higher equity losses from our investment in Hulu and lower network ad revenue, as well as higher programming costs. Ad revenue at the ABC network was down 4% in the third quarter, as the benefit of higher rates was more than offset by lower ratings, compared to prior year. So far this quarter, scatter pricing at the network continues to be very strong, pacing about 30% above upfront levels. Media Networks' affiliate revenue was up 5% in the third quarter. Cable affiliate revenue was up 3.5%, and would have been about 1 percentage point higher if not for a negative FX impact. Broadcasting affiliate revenue continue to grow nicely and was up double-digits for the quarter. At our Consumer Products and Interactive segment, operating income was lower in the third quarter, as decreases in our merchandise licensing and retail businesses were partially offset by an increase in our games business. Merchandise licensing results were lower in the quarter, as growth in licensing revenue from sales of Star Wars and Finding Dory merchandise was more than offset by strong sales of Frozen in the prior year, and unfavorable foreign exchange impact, and higher revenue share with the Studio, compared to prior year. Results in our games business improved, compared to third quarter last year due to a reduction in costs as a result of our exiting the Infinity games business. As we look ahead, I want to remind everyone that our fiscal fourth quarter results will reflect one less week of operations, compared to Q4 of last year, when we had a 53rd week due to our fiscal calendar. The extra week essentially drives a pro rata increase in annual operating income for the company. However, the impact varies by segment. We estimate last year, our Media Networks and Parks and Resorts segments disproportionately benefited from the 53rd week. We continue to actively repurchase our shares, and in the third quarter we bought back 15.2 million shares for $1.5 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, we've repurchased 65 million shares for approximately $6.6 billion. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell for questions.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Okay. Thanks, Christine. Katy, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our first question comes from Doug Mitchelson from UBS. Please go ahead.\nDoug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC: Oh, thanks so much. If I could just ask two. Bob, on BAM Tech you said that you love the business model, at least on CNBC you did. Will you be willing to discuss that in more detail? What about it do you love? Any comments about accretion or dilution from the deal would be helpful as well. And Christine, I just wanted to make sure I didn't miss it. I believe you said that cable network affiliate revenue growth was 3.5% in the quarter. Was that a worldwide number? And if that was a global result, that compares to 1.3% growth in fiscal 2Q. So if you could desegregate the acceleration, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Doug, I love the business model because I love the quality of what they've created, largely from a technology perspective. You're looking at an industry-leading platform. And we did a fair amount of due diligence on this, speaking with people who have been clients of their service. And also, we did our own due diligence in the sense that we've been clients of competing services. And we concluded that what they've got is really robust. As we consider that and we look at the marketplace and we look at general growth in Internet-delivered video, particularly live, we think this is a really smart investment for the company. And we really think it's smart strategically because we obviously need this capability to take product like ESPN, Disney and other Disney IP onto similar platforms. So we feel great about that. There is some very slight dilution from this 33% acquisition, however. But we feel really good about the trajectory of this business. Obviously by adding IP from the company, starting with ESPN, we think that it will give it the ability to grow faster than it would have grown on its own.\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President: Okay. Doug, on cable affiliate revenue growth, you're right that in this quarter it was up 3.5%. And also that would have been up one percentage point higher if it were not for the negative FX impact. You're correct that in the second quarter, it was 1.2%. And I wouldn't read too much into the quarter-by-quarter shifts in it. But the 3.5% is the right number for this quarter.\nDoug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC: All right. Thank you both.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you Doug. Katy, next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you. Just two questions if I can. First, with two of the bigger kind of streaming platforms launching over the next sort of six or so months with DTV and Hulu, and Disney's presence in both those packages, Bob, do you think this could become the delta that investors maybe are looking toward or are worried about in terms of creating a more notable shift away from linear TV or the traditional bundle? And if so, sort of how does it impact Disney's strategy or business at all? And then I just have a follow-up on the Parks business, which is continuing to be so strong and so impressive. I guess any commentary or feedback on how the dynamic pricing that you rolled out earlier this year may be favorably impacting those results.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Alexia, we know from what we've seen particularly in the last year, that the inclusion of Disney product, particularly ESPN, on these OTT services is quite meaningful. Sony certainly had that experience when it launched Sony Vue without ESPN. And then it included it later after the launch. And it saw its subs go up substantially. So clearly, we believe that by putting our product on these platforms, the platforms stand a chance of growing faster than they would have without it. Whether it will result, I guess, in a huge shift, I don't know. I think the consumer is largely going to dictate that, but I think it's important to point out that by us being on these platforms at prices that make sense to us, we're really quite neutral in terms of shifting from a traditional MVPD consumer to an over-the-top consumer. Meaning, the pricing of our networks is similar on the over-the-top networks than it is on the MVPD platforms. I guess I could add that \u2013 and I guess the DirecTV, AT&T platform, DirecTV Now is a great example of this. We think Hulu will be as well. These platforms provide \u2013 will provide great user interface and functionality. And the better the user interface, the better it is for us because we think the customer's going to be more engaged and is likely to consume at higher levels, which could only be good for us. So I'd say look, it's meaningful probably that we're going to be on these platforms. What it means in terms of the distribution of them, we can't say yet, meaning its impact on a shift from traditional to more modern forms of distribution. On the other \u2013 on the Parks business, I think there's a lot can be said about the Parks business. We, clearly, have had incredible strength domestically, both at Disneyland and at Disney World. We've had softness in Paris as we've cited. Actually Hong Kong has strengthened. We feel great about the launch of the park in Shanghai and our cruise ship business is also \u2013 which is in the Parks business \u2013 has been incredibly strong. We mentioned earlier we've not seen an impact from Zika. Interestingly enough, while there's a fair amount of concern about the international tourists, the mix of international tourists to our domestic Parks hasn't really shifted that much. We've had shifts market-to-market. Brazil's had some big issues in the last year, as a for instance. But the mix from international versus domestic attendance is basically in-line with what we've seen. And interestingly enough, Great Britain has been fairly strong, which given what's gone on there, particularly the headlines and the Brexit issue, you'd expect otherwise. And also of course the pound versus the dollar, but business is quite strong there. So we think \u2013 and we've got great product domestically. We're continuing to add to that. Avatar will open in 2017, as will the rest of the buildout of Animal Kingdom. We're investing with our Star Wars IP in both California and in Florida. So that bodes well long-term and we're building two new cruise ships. We feel bullish about the business, and I think that the launch of Shanghai should not go unnoticed in the sense that we built something that was very complex and very large and it opened flawlessly. And we know from what we've seen that consumers there really love the product, which is evidenced by the fact that they're staying much longer per visit than we ever expected. So we feel good about the business overall. There've been some foreign exchange issues that we've seen, but \u2013 and clearly what's happened in Europe on the terrorism front has put a damper on the Paris results. But I think the long-term trajectory of this business is quite strong.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Alexia, thanks a lot for the questions. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Thanks. I have two. One for Bob, one for Christine. Bob, on the announcement of Major League Baseball, you've said in the press release that the content will not be the same as a linear feed in ESPN. So can you give me an example of what type of content we're talking about? And will you launch the service globally at some point?\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: The goal is to launch the ESPN-branded service probably by the end of the year, but we're not saying specifically what date it will launch. It will include content that BAM Tech has already licensed for Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League, and we will add content that ESPN has licensed like college sports, football and basketball, tennis, rugby, cricket, et cetera. The goal is not to take product off ESPN's current channels but to use sports and product that ESPN has already licensed that's not appearing on the channels. And so we view this as a complementary service to what ESPN is already providing as part of their multichannel package. Obviously in an over-the-top, direct-to-consumer fashion. In terms of the international rollout, I don't think we've gotten that specific nor have we gotten specific about pricing. But I think what you can \u2013 you'll see over time is that we're going to create a form of dynamic pricing or pricing that is determined in part by the consumer which \u2013 where the consumer actually has a voice in the nature of the package that they buy. There'll be so much product on that you can buy the whole thing or you can buy parts of the whole, and that obviously will have an impact on pricing. And we feel really good about this as a complementary product to what ESPN has, and we feel great about the fact that it will be ESPN-branded.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then for Christine, as you mentioned you signed a new deal with DirecTV for an over-the-top offering. Do those deals and the deals you do with Dish together somehow open up negotiations on the linear side? So is there potentially a change in the step-function of the linear relationship once you see the OTT launch announced?\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think it probably will have an impact on the linear negotiations over time. One thing we should add is that a component of this deal is to provide AT&T Direct with in-season stacking of all episodes of our network shows, which I guess is in the form of change or amendment to the existing deal. We've actually done a similar deal recently with Comcast that I think has been maybe reported on but we haven't been specific or announced. So that basically means that two of the largest MVPDs, AT&T Direct and Comcast, will now have access to in-season stacking of all episodes of our shows. And that's obviously designed to strengthen the traditional MVPD package, and on the DirecTV AT&T side was a result of essentially a new negotiation for this OTT service.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Okay. Thanks, Bob.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Thanks, Michael. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Omar Sheikh from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nOmar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good evening, everyone. Just a couple of questions. First of all, Bob, you've now got a few options on the over-the-top front. You've got the new investment in BAM Tech. You've got Hulu. Obviously, last year, you announced DisneyLife. You've got these new third-party arrangements. I wonder if you could just maybe help us understand how you prioritize where you put content, whether it's from ESPN or from the cable nets or from ABC. It would be helpful to get your thoughts on that. And then secondly, I wonder if you have any details on the succession, whether there's anything you'd like to share with us on timing or on thoughts on that front. Thanks.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: The prioritization on where we put content is all driven by monetization. And where we monetize, where we can monetize the most is where the content will go. And right now, the reason the MVPD, multichannel MVPD product, is the priority is that's where we're monetizing the most. And by the way, the same thing is true with other types of products, like our movie output deal with Netflix, for instance, and some of the other sales that we've made, the Netflix, with Hulu, Amazon, other distributors. What will be interesting is long-term, to what extent do we hold back product to put on services that are ours that we're selling direct to consumer versus third-party distributors, but it's really premature to get into all of that because right now, we've got kind of a best of all worlds in the sense that we're monetizing really well on multiple platforms from multiple parties. And we're starting to move some product in the direct-to-consumer fashion, like what we're doing in the U.K. with DisneyLife, which again is a complimentary service to other subscriptions. In U.K.'s case, the Sky would be the best example of that, where the product that is on DisneyLife is complimentary, in a way, to what is on Sky and does not really rob or deprive Sky of product because we're monetizing so much better from Sky. I have nothing really new to add on the succession front except that we have a really strong Disney board. They are very focused on the subject of succession and committed to it. They have an ongoing process and we're all confident that it will result in a good decision for the Walt Disney Co. and its shareholders long-term.\nOmar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Omar, thank you. Katy, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks. On these OTT platforms, could you talk about the advertising opportunity? And also, will it be the same ad loads, the same sales force? And I guess on the affiliate fee side, when Bob used a similar pricing, are the whole suite of channels included so that your total affiliate fee is similar?\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: On the advertising front, we use the same sales force. We've been doing that for a while. So particularly in ESPN's case, all of its digital advertising is sold by the same team. In fact, a lot of the advertising buys are across platforms, if not all of them, at ESPN. There are opportunities that will be new to us on the OTT platforms because some of the technology platforms will offer dynamic ad insertion. And we think that that's got some real potential for the company. And that is a component of the DirecTV Now relationship. And in terms of the ad load, I think there probably will be some \u2013 it will be variability. But in live sports, the ad load will basically be the same. Was there another part of that question that I missed?\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: It was about the affiliate fee. And then just one other question on advertising. Christine said that scatter is 30% above the upfront. I'm just wondering, is it the 2015 upfront or you're referring to a 2016?\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: On the affiliate fee, the per-channel fees \u2013 which we're not getting too specific about \u2013 are commensurate with what the fees are on the existing services. So it's essentially neutral to us in terms of migration. And the new service will take 100% of our core channels. Not 100% of our channels but of our core channels. And we won't get much more specific than that at this point. But the key channels, particularly at ESPN, will be distributed by DirecTV Now, as well as Disney Channel and Freeform and ABC, et cetera.\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President: And, Jessica, that scatter pricing of over 30% is above the upfront of last year.\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Jessica, thank you. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Please go ahead.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you very much for taking my questions. So on the BAM Tech investment, I think the question that most people have would be, does the new investment here require incremental investments in sports rights? So it sounds like the answer is no, because it's leveraging existing rights that BAM has and that ESPN has. But I just want to make sure that I'm as clear as possible on that. Maybe by way of one example, the ACC deal that you talked about in the prepared remarks, the deal that ESPN just signed \u2013 will ESPN be able to make available any of that ACC content? For example, in the over-the-top direct-to-consumer BAM Tech ESPN platform? Or are those rights at least partially or entirely tied to the linear ESPN, where you would need go back and ask the ACC for the digital rights, therefore needing to incrementally invest in the rights to put it on the new platform? I hope that's clear. And...\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well \u2013 go ahead.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Well, so \u2013 go ahead. And then I hopefully have a follow-up. But that's the crux of the question here is, will Disney ESPN need to incrementally invest in digital sports rights from here?\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Anthony, it's a really good question. The answer is no, that we have purchased a lot of rights. We won't get specific about exactly what they are. But we have a lot of rights that are already purchased to put product on this platform. And BAM has licensed a significant amount of rights as well. So we'll be able to launch this service without adding any additional costs to purchase new rights. What specific rights will be on \u2013 you mentioned ACC \u2013 we're not going to get into details. Obviously we're going to be launching an ACC channel and a platform. And we're going to be mindful of the product that we put on that as we go to the distribution world and seek distribution for that. I will say that long-term, there may be an opportunity to purchase additional rights to put onto this service. Because the technology is so robust that we actually believe that it does enable us to potentially expand our sports offering, which is something long-term down the road we will consider. But from a near-term \u2013 on a near-term basis, don't expect there's any incremental costs associated with rights acquisition.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: In order to service this platform.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay, Bob. Thanks. And one follow-up, please. In terms of your response to Michael Nathanson's earlier question, you referred to amendments to the AT&T DirecTV affiliate agreement and the Comcast agreement in terms of new stacking rights or VOD rights that Disney's provided to those MVPDs. The question is, do those or do those amendments have any impact on the trajectory of the cable networks' affiliate fee growth? So the 3.5% or adjusted 4.5% growth that Christine mentioned. So from here, do those amendments change the shape or the trajectory of cable networks affiliate fee growth? Thank you.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No, I wouldn't say that they will, except there was consideration for the rights that we're bestowing. But I won't get into details about what that consideration was. But don't expect it's going to have a meaningful impact on cable fee increases. Where it could have an impact is if it enables the MVPDs to retain subs more effectively. Then I think that's to be considered a real positive. But the rights weren't just given away, but there are other considerations.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Bob.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Make sense?\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yep. Thanks.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Okay. Anthony, thank you. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nTodd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Oh, hi. Thanks for taken mine. Quick one for Christine. I hope it's quick, and then maybe a more broad one for Bob. Christine I'm hoping you might just be willing to help us with a little more of the ins and outs on the cable network revenue. I've got the affiliate fee. I won't press you on that any further. I don't think I heard a cable advertising number from you. Forgive me if you said it and I missed it. And then I know there's an offset it looks like from programming sales on the Kids and Freeform side. So any comment on those two items and how they all come together would be helpful. Bob, I'll just give you my other one while I've got you and then I'll shut up. Thinking about all of the what's going on in your sports universe. Would love to hear how you think about the tradeoff between launching more and more \u2013 like you said, there's so much product out there, so much good content out there, various people have interest in. How do you think about the tradeoff of launching and proliferating more and more specific type services? The ACC, the SEC, this over-the-top one? Versus keeping the power of the flagship mainstay network? And basically the tradeoff between making everybody want everything and the risk that you finally give people the specific things they want and maybe in overall you end up with less, if you know what I mean. Would love to hear your just thoughts how you do that balance. Thank you both.\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President: I'll take the first one, Todd. And I did mention on my comments that the ESPN ad revenue this quarter was up 5%.\nTodd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: On your \u2013 go ahead, you want another question for Christine before I respond?\nTodd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So that's ESPN. Nothing on the total cable side and nothing you'll disclose on the program sales side, Christine. It's okay with whatever your answer is.\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President: That level of detail is all in the Q.\nTodd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think your question about a proliferation of sports is a fair question. We ultimately believe that where we will end up is a bigger piece of a bigger pie. In the sense that we think the ACC is very attractive product. We have every reason to believe that something would have been launched eventually from the ACC. And we wanted to participate in and facilitate that launch. We feel the same about what we're doing with BAM. We think that there's actually an expanding sports universe because there are a lot of sports that are on that do not get as much distribution. And there's significant interest in live and in live sports that if you look at the NBA finals as an example. Now maybe not a great example because they were so great. But we just \u2013 or to look at the NFL, another great example. In general, live sports has really thrived, even in a world where there's so much more for people to do and to watch. And we believe that our best interest as a company is to invest more in the total pie.\nTodd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you very much.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: By the way, even if it means fragmentation, because we ultimately think that all of the new parts will be greater than the current whole. All of the addition of the new parts will result in a bigger whole.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: You good, Todd?\nTodd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yeah, I'll let it go at that. Thank you, both, for your help. Thanks.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: All right. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. One for Bob and one for Christine, as well. Bob, just taking the other side of the sports rights analysis that you guys did, you've walked away from deals in the past. I'm thinking about NASCAR and others. And there's some press reports that maybe you're downsizing your Big Ten deal. How are you thinking about balancing rights and sort of the benefits of fragmentation you just talked about with the escalating costs and competition for those rights? Well, I don't know if you'll comment on Big Ten specifically or not. But maybe just at a high level as we think about rights fees growth over time. And then just shifting to the parks, Christine, I think the release suggests that the domestic OpEx was down year-on-year in the quarter, or at least labor and marketings, some common site infrastructure? Can you just help us put that into context, sort of what's driving that? How sustainable it is. Any one-time events in there we should be thinking about? Thank you.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: You want to take the second part first?\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President: Sure. In the parks this quarter, as I mentioned also in the comments, that they did have some cost-control measures, some cost initiatives. And that flowed through in their operating line.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And to cover your question, Ben, about sports rights in general and things that we passed on in the Big Ten, we won't get too specific about the Big Ten except to say we're hopeful that we will continue a relationship with them. We look at ESPN as a whole and their menu of sports product, and we've tried hard to extend relationships with sports that are delivering great value to ESPN and that will continue to, and in some cases, we really believe have growth potential. The new NBA deal that kicks in, we feel great about, even though there's a substantial increase in rights from the last year of the old deal to the first year of the new. We're expanding our rights package with the NBA and we believe that it's still a sport that's on the rise in terms of popularity. Because live sports is very attractive to distributors, to advertisers, to consumers, we don't really see the costs abating. There's just a lot of competition for it. There's a lot of demand for the quality that sports represents. And we know that we can't buy everything, so we've made some tough decisions, but we can't look you in the eye and say that costs are going to go down because still among the most valuable product that's out there.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nJason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Just a question for Mr. Iger. Regarding BAM Tech, in the release it talks about your option to increase your stake over time in the coming years. And I was just wondering if you could comment qualitatively about what are the factors that you'll be looking for in terms of whether you decide to scale up your position? Is it the technical capability of the platform? Is it the financial metrics this entity will generate? Is it the evolution of the OTT marketplace or at large? Just any color.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think \u2013 probably be a number of factors, maybe all of them that you mentioned. We feel great about where they are technically, by the way. We think \u2013 we feel great about the potential, and I don't want to say that our purchase of a controlling stake is inevitable, but we wanted to maintain the option to do that, sort of a bit of a walk before we run. Although admittedly, we're walking very fast initially with the size of this investment and the collaboration that we're going \u2013 that will result in between us and the BAM Tech team. But we just wanted to get a sense for where the business is going and what the scope or scale of this is. It also gives BAM a chance to monetize the remaining stake that we might buy at a level that's commensurate with the value at the time that we make the purchase.\nJason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Understood. Thank you.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Jason, thank you. Katy, next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Kraft from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. I wanted to ask about foreign currency and also consumer products. Christine, how should we think about the impact of foreign currency going forward given where spot rates are and the hedges that you have in place? And then \u2013 excuse me \u2013 on the Consumer Product side, I guess I was a little surprised to see it down two quarters in a row. Should we expect Frozen to continue to drive tough comps for several more quarters, or is this something that has worked its way through the system now? And \u2013 excuse me \u2013 you've created and refreshed so much IP over the past year. Is any of that going to, do you think, become a new emerging growth driver as we go forward? Thank you.\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President: Okay. So on foreign exchange, Bryan, we had the estimated year-over-year impact for fiscal 2016 at $500 million and that is still a good number. So, looking \u2013 and you're probably referring to the impact of Brexit and did that have any significant impact either on 2016 or looking forward \u2013 on 2016 it did not, because we were 100% hedged for the year. So changes during this year did not impact our foreign currency exposure. And when Brexit occurred, we were already 85% hedged for fiscal 2017. So the impact from those currency shifts post-Brexit were very muted for us. On DCP, I think it's fair to assume that the difficult Frozen comps will continue. As you know, that was a tremendous piece of IP for us and it was very, very successful in our consumer products division. So those comps will continue to be difficult on a quarterly basis.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Let me add to that, though, by saying that we are making another Frozen movie, although it won't be out for a few years. And that in our slate in fiscal 2017 is another Star Wars movie and a Cars movie. And Cars, before Frozen, was the number one Consumer Products franchise at the company. Not as big as Star Wars, but really significant. So \u2013 and we also have Spiderman being released by Sony but being made by us, as well as Thor in calendar 2017. And so we have a lot of Marvel activity as well. And then, of course, we've recently with Zootopia had some real success at Disney Animation, which gives us a new franchise to mine, admittedly not nearly as big as some of the other franchises. So there's a lot of activity there. And if you look at the film slate over the next number of years, there's a significant amount of IP. Beauty and the Beast is another coming out in March from the Studio that Consumer Products can mine. Also \u2013 let's also recognize the fact that Consumer Products has doubled its earnings over the last four years. That's just tremendous, tremendous growth. And it will be hard to top that over the next number of years. But what we've built is an incredible engine to leverage and monetize the IP output of this company over a long period of time and globally. And no one's got that.\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President: And just one more thing. On Frozen, while that's a difficult comp, let's not forget that Star Wars and Finding Dory merchandise was very strong this quarter.\nBryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Okay, Bryan. Thanks. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Nollen from Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nTim Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you. Couple of things, please. I wanted to ask another question on BAM Tech, which is actually if you could give us a little bit of color on how that business does on its own. Bob, you mentioned it might be slightly dilutive. I wonder if that's given its relatively low margin or borrowing costs to finance the deal, what that might be. But anything you can tell us on how BAM Tech's business on its own is going. And then actually another question on Shanghai, which I guess excluding BAM Tech might have been the story of the quarter. Curious if you could tell us a bit more about your visitation there. Is it mostly local Chinese visitors, as you had said it would be? Or if there's any \u2013 can you talk about the mix in terms of other visitors from the region? And then also about anything might give us help on per-cap spending there versus your other parks would be interesting to hear. Thanks.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. We're not going to get specific about BAM Tech. We said it's going to be dilutive but very \u2013 in a very modest way. And it's obviously not been a public company, but we're just not going to get specific about that. I can tell you a fair amount about Shanghai, although not going to give you too many numbers. We expected in opening that a large part of the visitation would come from Shanghai, and actually we've been surprised that the visitation from the rest of China has been as strong as it has been, because our concentration from a marketing perspective was largely in the local region. But it's come from all over China. One factor could be that Shanghai is a tourist destination for the rest of China, particularly in the summer, and that people from Shanghai are waiting for the tourist season to end before they visit. Now our visitation from Shanghai has also been strong. We did some research and there was 98% awareness of the park among the people in Shanghai and well over 70% intent to visit from the people in Shanghai. So that's really \u2013 those are incredible statistics. I mentioned earlier on the call that people who are coming are staying almost two hours longer than we expected. That's a very good thing, because it suggests that they are really enjoying the product. And that in fact is the case, because we've done a fair amount of research on guest reaction, guest satisfaction, and it's very high. We won't get very specific with you about per caps, except the per caps have been quite strong, particularly in the food and beverage side. And we're also doing very well with our hotels: 95%, 96% occupancy. And Lion King, which is a separate ticket, is also doing extremely well and very well booked. So we had essentially a flawless opening that the people, not just of Shanghai, but the people of China have embraced. Clearly the marketing has worked and the product is performing really well. And with that in mind we're already expanding. We broke ground a while ago on expansion of the park. We've not announced exactly what it is that we're building, but we're already building to expand and we have plenty of property, I should remind everyone. So that we have an opportunity to build out new lands, new gate, new hotels, new restaurants, et cetera. All very positive.\nTim Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: All right. Thanks for the question. Operator, we have time for one more question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Two questions, maybe one for Bob, one for Christine. Bob, just to take a step back from the OTT world for a moment, Dish last week unveiled a new service offering that they're calling a skinny bundle that did not include ESPN in the core package. I'd be interested just to hear your thoughts on that. And then second for Christine, Parks and Resorts CapEx eased off really nicely this quarter. Obviously we're getting past Shanghai. Just curious to hear are we starting to get to the point where we're coming down? Or do we see some upticks from some of the other domestic projects that are starting to get underway?\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: That new Sling product is pretty skinny. I was going to say so skinny you can't even see it. But I mentioned earlier on the call that a few new products have entered the marketplace without us, namely without ESPN. Sony was one. And had real troubles getting off the ground. And in Sony's case, when ESPN was added they had a significant uptick in their subs. So I don't want to suggest that Sling has to have ESPN. They'll determine that. But as we look at the product that they're offering, we really don't believe that it's going to have \u2013 it has a great future, because it's lacking some of the most attractive channels that are out there. You can slice and dice some of these channels, but \u2013 to create packages, but if you don't have some of the best ones, it's pretty hard to see significant adoption of the service that's being offered.\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President: Okay. On Parks CapEx, you're right in that the number was down for the quarter. But I wouldn't read too much into that. A lot of that is timing related. As we've mentioned before and Bob mentioned, the offerings that will be \u2013 that are underway and soon to come to the theme park near you, such as the Star Wars lands in both Anaheim and Orlando, those are underway. So this CapEx is more of a timing issue, and we will update next quarter for the prospective year what to look forward to for fiscal 2017.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I just \u2013 this is Bob. I just want to thank everybody for the call and hope you all have a good rest of your summer. We feel really good about this quarter. Clearly the bottom-line 12% increase in EPS was quite strong. The Studio's performance, as Christine mentioned, through three quarters is record performance for us already, maybe a record performance for any studio in the industry. And the slate going forward is extremely strong. What we did in Shanghai was certainly something that we feel great about and very excited about. And the future there is very bright. And the two announcements that we made today are really important. BAM Tech provides us with a great opportunity in a space that is very exciting, both to us and to consumers, and the OTT relationship that we've now created with AT&T Direct is also very important. We think they're going to launch an incredibly robust platform with a great user interface, and it's great to be part of that launch. And I thank you all very much.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Okay, Bob. Thanks. I guess I now get to read the Safe Harbor. So thanks again, everyone, for joining us today.

I'll now turn the call over to Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Good afternoon and welcome to The Walt Disney Company second quarter 2016 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 45 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and the webcast and the transcript will also be available on our website. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Christine is going to lead off, followed by Bob, and then, of course, we'll be happy to take your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Christine to get started.\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President: Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter earnings per share, excluding items affecting comparability, were up 11% to $1.36, marking the 11th consecutive quarter in which we've delivered double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share. Our financial results this quarter, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment, demonstrate once again how the strength of our brand and a relentless focus on creative excellence and execution can continue to drive growth across our businesses and create value for our shareholders. Our Studio delivered another great quarter, with operating income up 27% versus last year. The growth in operating income was primarily due to the worldwide theatrical success of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Disney Animation's Zootopia. Fiscal 2015 was a record year for the Studio and the first half of fiscal 2016 is off to a record start with over $1.5 billion in operating income due to the phenomenal performance of our film slate. Fiscal year-to-date, Star Wars: The Force Awakens has generated almost $2.1 billion in global box office. Zootopia has generated $960 million, making it the number one film of the year so far and the second highest grossing Disney Animation Studio film behind Frozen. I'll also note that Zootopia is the number one animated film of all time in China, grossing over $235 million to-date. The success of our Studio is no accident. It is the result of our strategy of making high-quality branded films and leveraging that success across a number of our integrated businesses. No company does a better job than Disney in creating, cultivating and extending the value of a franchise. As a result, when we have a successful film franchise, we're able to drive industry-leading returns on investment. At Parks and Resorts, the investments we've made to both maintain a high level of guest experience and to drive demand continue to pay off. In Q2, the segment set new second quarter records in both revenue and operating income. Our domestic operations in particular continued to benefit from strong demand from guests, specifically at our domestic parks and at Disney Cruise Line. Operating income at our domestic operations was up over 20% in the quarter, and margins were higher by about 300 basis points. Attendance at our domestic parks was comparable to the second quarter last year and per capita spending was up 8% on higher admissions, food and beverage, and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 5% and occupancy was down one percentage point to 88%. Second quarter results reflect the unfavorable impact of the New Year's holiday shifting into our first fiscal quarter, which was largely offset by the favorable impact of the shift of the Easter holiday. The shift of the Easter holiday period will also have an impact on Parks' third quarter results, as the holiday period fell in the second quarter this year, whereas the holiday period fell during the third quarter last year. As a result, about $90 million in operating income was shifted into Q2 that was recognized in Q3 last year. Domestic resort reservations for the third quarter are pacing up 5% compared to prior year levels, while booked rates are down 2% reflecting the impact of the Easter holiday shift. Our Cruise business set new second quarter records in revenue and operating income, driven by higher ticket pricing and onboard spending. Disney Cruise Line continues to be a market leader in innovation, creativity and guest service. The business achieved record financial performance in 2015 and that strength continues in fiscal 2016 with Disney Cruise Line generating its best first half ever. During the second quarter, we announced plans to build two additional ships that will be completed in 2021 and 2023. Our decision to expand the fleet was driven by the outstanding guest response to our product and a business in which we have a strong competitive advantage, and where we believe we can drive attractive returns on investment. Growth in domestic operations was partially offset by a decline at our international parks due primarily to preopening spending at Shanghai Disney Resort. We're extremely excited for the grand opening of the resort which Bob will discuss in greater detail. Operating income at Media Networks was up 9% in the second quarter due to growth in Cable, which was primarily driven by higher operating income at ESPN. The higher results at ESPN benefited from lower programming and production costs in the second quarter and higher affiliate revenue, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. Lower programming costs and advertising revenue reflect the shift of six New Year's Eve and New Year's Day College Football Playoff bowl games, including the two semifinal games. These games aired during our first fiscal quarter this year, whereas they aired during our second fiscal quarter last year. The shift in timing of the bowl games had an adverse impact on ESPN's ratings and CPMs in the second quarter, which were partially offset by an increase in units sold. As a result, ESPN's ad revenue was down 13%, but we estimate ad revenue would have been up about 3% adjusted for the timing of the bowl games. So far this quarter, ESPN ad sales are pacing up 5% versus prior year. Broadcasting operating income was down in the second quarter as growth in affiliate and advertising revenue was more than offset by lower income from program sales compared to prior year, as well as higher programming costs. Ad revenue at the ABC network was up 5% in the second quarter and benefited from higher rates, but was adversely impacted by lower ratings in the quarter compared to prior year. So far this quarter, scatter pricing at the network is pacing 20% above upfront levels. Media Networks' affiliate revenue was up 5% adjusted for the adverse impact of foreign exchange and leap day, driven by 4% adjusted affiliate revenue growth at Cable and double-digit growth at Broadcasting. At our Consumer Products and Interactive segment, operating income was lower in the quarter. Our Merchandise Licensing business was up in the quarter, but segment results were weighed down by an adverse impact from foreign exchange as well as lower results from both our Disney Store business and Infinity. When you look at the segment results, it's important to note our underlying Merchandise Licensing business remains very strong. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up 18% in the second quarter. This was driven by strong ongoing demand for Star Wars merchandise, partially offset by the expected difficult year-over-year Frozen comparison. Merchandise Licensing was also impacted by lower minimum guarantee shortfall recognition in the quarter, which relates to the shift in our fiscal calendar. So, while some headwinds and timing-related ins and outs impacted second quarter results, we are quite pleased with our first half segment results. Comparable earned licensing revenue was up over 20% for the first half of the fiscal year, which helped drive Merchandise Licensing operating income growth of over 20%, and segment operating income growth of 12%. During the quarter, we took a charge of $147 million in connection with the shutdown of our Infinity console games business. Going forward, our console games strategy will focus solely on licensing our great portfolio of content. We continue to actively repurchase our shares, and in the second quarter, we bought back 20.8 million shares for $2 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, we've repurchased about 47.3 million shares for approximately $4.9 billion. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Christine, and good afternoon. Since Christine has already covered our businesses in the quarter, I want to focus on a couple of things we're very excited about; the unbelievable momentum of our Studio and the grand opening of Shanghai Disney Resort, which is now just about a month away. Since our acquisition of Pixar, we've released 27 movies under the Pixar, Disney Animation, Marvel and Lucasfilm brands, with an average global box office of about $770 million each. And as Christine mentioned, the Studio's winning streak continues. This weekend, our 2016 box office total crossed $1 billion domestically, $2 billion internationally and $3 billion globally, reaching those milestones faster than any studio in history. Zootopia's fantastic performance is just the latest in a string of incredibly successful original movies from our Animation Studios, including Inside Out, Big Hero 6 and Frozen, to name a few. We're also having tremendous success reimagining Disney classics as exciting live-action movies, most recently with The Jungle Book, a stunning movie pushing the limits of innovation and technology to bring some of our most beloved characters to life in a spectacular new way. It's been gratifying to see the worldwide response. Global box office for The Jungle Book to-date is $783 million, including almost $150 million in China. And in India, it's now the highest grossing Hollywood movie in history. And of course, Marvel's Captain America: Civil War just opened around the world to wide acclaim and huge box office. Its domestic debut last weekend generated almost $180 million in box office, making it the fifth biggest opening weekend of all time. With this success, our studio has delivered five of the top six opening weekends on record. Global box office to-date for Captain America: Civil War is more than $705 million and climbing. There are now 13 films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe generating almost $10 billion in global box office to-date. We've got an unprecedented pipeline of terrific movies on the way, with major release dates announced through the end of the decade. In the near-term, we're looking forward to Alice Through the Looking Glass and Pixar's Finding Dory, which will both be in theaters this summer. We're obviously very thrilled with our Studios' performance and its position going forward, but what we're most excited about right now is the grand opening of the spectacular Shanghai Disney Resort on June 16. I was there again last week as we were putting the finishing touches on the resort. We began trial operations over the weekend, allowing invited guests to explore the park and enjoy some of the attractions, entertainment and dining experiences. It's incredibly exciting for all of us to see the park truly come alive for the first time, and the initial feedback from guests so far has been absolutely phenomenal. We'll continue to fine-tune everything over the next few weeks to ensure the experience we deliver on opening day is everything we want it to be for our guests. After 17 years of working on this project, I'm still awed by it. The scale, the detail, the sheer artistry; it's all breathtaking. I find something new to marvel over every time I visit and I know our guests will do the same. Even though it has all of the Disney details, it's unlike any other destination we've ever created. We set out to build something truly extraordinary and we've succeeded in a way that far exceeds our most ambitious expectations. We've re-imagined everything. Even our most familiar iconic attractions have been elevated and transformed with the help of cutting edge technology that allows us to take our creativity farther. Anchoring our first-ever Pirates-themed land, Shanghai's Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Sunken Treasure is the first attraction inspired by the blockbuster movie franchise. Its stunning size and incredible technological innovation allow us to immerse our guests in a grand adventure on the high seas like never before. We've also re-imagined the Disney Castle expanding the size and introducing more entertainment, experiences and shopping, and we're introducing new lands and brand new attractions throughout the park like the TRON Light Cycles. We've taken great care to create a number of stunning features and original experiences, especially for our Chinese guests as well, including some unbelievable entertainment throughout the resort such as our first-ever Mandarin production of The Lion King. It really is impossible to overstate our excitement about this spectacular resort. It represents the very best that Disney has to offer in a way that is both respectful and relevant to the people of China, or as we have been saying, it is authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese, and we can't wait to share it with the world. Opening the gates and officially welcoming our first guests will be one of the proudest and most exciting moments in the history of this phenomenal company, not to mention a monumental achievement. And with that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Lowell, and Christine and I will be happy to take your questions. Lowell?\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Bob, thanks a lot. Operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our first question comes from Anthony DiClemente. Please go ahead.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. I'll start with one for Bob. Bob, I hope you find this to be a fair question. I think investors would value any context that you could provide us with respect to Tom's resignation last month? And looking forward if you can give us any update on CEO succession plans? And specifically help us out with the probability that your contract could potentially be extended beyond June of 2018? And then, Christine, you said I think recurring Cable Networks affiliate fee growth at Cable was 4% in the quarter. I think that was 0.5 point ahead of the 3.5% that you realized last quarter. Could you just talk about the drivers of the 4% in terms of rate and volume? And any forward outlook that you'd be willing to provide us? Thanks a lot.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Anthony, thank you, and I don't mind your question at all. Obviously, Tom was a valued colleague and a friend of mine and many others at the company. And so we're sorry what came to pass, but we don't really have much more to say about that. I will say that \u2013 or remind people that I have just over two years left on my contract as CEO of the company. And the board is very actively engaged in a succession process as it has been actually for some time. And it believes that it has ample time to identify a successor under timing circumstances that will be just fine for the company. I have nothing really to add in terms of the extension of my contract except that I don't currently have any plans to extend beyond the June expiration date that is June of 2018.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. Thanks.\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President: Anthony, your question on the affiliate revenue growth. For Media Nets, we gave you a 4% adjusted affiliate growth at Cable. That was based on a solid rate of growth with some offset from foreign exchange and subs.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. And I think just as a follow-up, last quarter you had talked about an uptick earlier in the year from lighter packages, I think in part driven by Sling TV subscribers. So do you care to kind of talk about that? Were the lighter bundles, were the Sling TV like services a driver of subs in any way? Can you kind of characterize the trajectory of those subs for ESPN? That'd be helpful. Thanks.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes, Anthony, I'll take this one. We launched with Sling as you referenced. We also launched with Sony Vue. And the numbers on both of those platforms have been encouraging and they were a driver of sub. They did contribute incremental subs for ESPN this last quarter. But we're also in discussions with a number of entities, some current distributors that are coming forward with new packages and some completely new distributors, all have expressed an avid interest in having ESPN and our other channels included in their initial offerings, and we're very, very encouraged by the discussions/negotiations that we're having. But other than the Verizon settlement that was mentioned today, we don't really have any new news to give you on this at the moment, except to say again, that there are a number of new entrants in the marketplace. They all want ESPN. We like the status of our talks with them. And we actually like the trends as well. These products are very attractive, because they're offering consumers more choice. They typically are better at mobility and their user interface is really positive, is really strong. And those are all really important when it comes to today's environment. So we think long-term, given the discussions that we have and given the experience that we've had these last few months, we feel good about what we're seeing.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Anthony, thanks for the question. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, thank you. I guess, just to start off if I can, maybe, Bob, follow up with your commentary just now about being in discussions with a number of potential over-the-top or streaming partners there. How expansive do you think that opportunity can be? I think if you look out for the next few years, do you think it can be a meaningful positive, or have a meaningful positive impact on either your subs or affiliate revenue outlook?\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think it will have a meaningful effect on the marketplace for us. I can't really give guidance in terms of where I think it's going to end up, whether we would be ahead of what our projections were at one point. But there definitely are very, very encouraging signs in terms of what we've seen already. And we're not at liberty to give numbers for Sling or for Sony except we can say that we anecdotally were told that after ESPN was included in their package they saw some very, very encouraging signups or trend in terms of signups. So, I think, this is all very positive for us. And as I just mentioned as a response to the prior question, the conversations we're having have been quite productive. We just haven't concluded new deals to announce as of today.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And then a follow-up if I can, just looking at the Parks business. You've got a lot of moving pieces there; obviously, the big opening in Shanghai. You've got expansion plans domestically, dynamic pricing going on, all those technological innovations there. I guess what do you see as the biggest maybe opportunity for a profit contributor for profit growth going forward?\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think you're going to see a number of contributors. It'll take some time for Shanghai to contribute because we've got start-up costs and we're walking before we run there as well. But eventually we have very, very optimistic outlook about the park that we're opening there and about the market in general. We like the steps that we've taken in terms of pricing. We've taken a number of steps or made a number of steps to essentially grow revenue, in some cases, actually at the expense of some attendance where we're changing our pricing approach. Sometimes in part to moderate attendance so that the park experiences a little bit better but all designed with the effect of essentially raising revenue. As you mentioned, we like some of the investments that we're making on the technology front. We also like what we've got in the works in terms of expansion and other locations; the Star Wars lands that we're building in Florida and in California; Avatar, in Florida, which opens before that. We announced two new cruise ships that's coming down the road, I think 2021 and 2023 as a for instance. We're looking at other expansion opportunities in Hong Kong and Tokyo. And generally, we think you're going to see a number of contributors to growth across that sector.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you, Alexia, for the questions. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Thanks, hi. One for Christine, and then I'll ask one to Bob. Christine, can we focus a bit on Consumer Products, which surprised us? Can you walk through the impact to profit growth? If you look at the first quarter, you guys were up 23% of profits. This quarter you were down 8%. So what impacted that delta in growth? And how do you think about growth to products for the rest of the year?\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President: Sure. Thanks, Michael. You're absolutely right. The first quarter growth was 23% followed by the 8% decline this quarter and there's several factors that slowed the overall growth rate. The first I'd like to mention is that the earned revenue growth was strong again in Q2, at 18%. Now, that compares to an extremely strong growth in Q1 that was 23% in earned revenue growth. But again, second quarter was very strong at 18%. Star Wars, we all know, was a great contributor in Q2. But it didn't have quite the massive contribution it had in Q1. And also remember, in Q1, we had the Q4 deferral of the Episode VII merchandise revenue \u2013 the revenue associated with that merchandise. So that from Q4 was also moved into Q1, which had a bolstering effect on Q1. We also have a timing issue of guarantee shortfall payments that helped in Q1. And they were a drag in Q2, as I mentioned in my comments. And also, lastly, I'll mention that Battlefront was a much more significant driver in Q1 than it was in Q2. And I think if you look at those, those are good contributing factors to the quarter-to-quarter decline.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And, Michael...\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: I know...\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: ...before you ask me a question, I think it's really important with this business not to look at it as a quarterly business. Because we're not only continuing to support the $11 billion-plus franchises that we have as a company, but we continue to create intellectual property that is leverageable across our Consumer Products businesses. Now, not all is leverageable as Star Wars and Frozen, as a for instance, but when you look at Zootopia and you look at Jungle Book, somewhat small so far, but Captain America won't be and the impact of Captain America long-term on that business and the other Marvel properties, the reintroduction of Spider-Man. Spider-Man is the hottest or the number one Marvel character from a consumer merchandise perspective. And reintroducing Spider-Man successfully as we've done in Captain America through the release next year, 2017 of Spider-Man, is something that also has to be considered. So it's a kind of business that I think is very difficult to measure in terms of the bottom line success on a quarterly basis. We just don't run it that way.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Right. And it's hard for us to model it, too.\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President: And, Michael, I know you asked about sort of guidance going forward, and we don't provide guidance. But as Bob mentioned, we think we have the best portfolio of properties and we're very encouraged by what we see in this business.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Okay, thanks. And, Bob, can I just ask you one on Hulu? Last week...\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: ...Hulu confirmed they're going to launch a virtual MSO sometime next year. And as a partner in Hulu and someone who's talked a lot about having the opportunity in the marketplace, I wonder what would you like to see as a design that maybe fits in between the large bundle of the MVPDs and what Sling and Sony Vue are doing? So if you could actually build something for the future, what are the elements that you think are missing from today's marketplace?\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I'll answer. Before I do, Hulu's become an important investment for us, not just as a distributor of the programs that we make, but ultimately as a buyer of original product and ultimately as a distributor of our channels. And we think they have a great opportunity to become an OTT MVPD because they can leverage their current user base. And they also have a good user interface. I don't want to speak for them fully, but what they're looking at is a best-of-cable approach, which I guess the response specifically to your question, would put them between the big, expanded basic bundle category and some of the lightest packages that are available like some of what Sling has put out. We feel really good about the opportunity. We're also fully aligned with our partners at 21st Century Fox on the strategy. And I also know that there have been questions asked about what the impact of going into the distribution business is on our current distribution partners. And to that I would respond, even though you didn't ask the question, there are a number of our current distribution partners that are in the content ownership, content creation business, most notably Comcast and its purchase of NBCUniversal. So, we don't think that there's any negative impact whatsoever to us, going into the business of distributing our channels.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Thanks, Lowell.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you, Michael. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thanks. I guess to follow up on the Hulu question, could you say anything about the timing of the launch? And you said best of, kind of, in between the bigger bundle, but what it will look like and anything \u2013 if you could say anything on pricing. And does it change the way you will sell, or you plan to sell to SVOD and OTT? And moving away from that, on the advertising market, it's been incredibly buoyant. How are you thinking about approaching the upfront market? Are there any changes in your sales approach into the upfront or generally speaking? Do you look more to targeted, et cetera, et cetera?\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I'll answer the second part of the question first. We're not going to get into details in terms of our strategy going to the upfront except that we would agree with what you said. We see a very robust marketplace and a very strong upfront ahead, both for our broadcast network for ABC, and for ESPN. We're very encouraged with what we see, but we're not going to disclose what our strategy is going in. Your question about Hulu, I don't think they've been specific about when they're going to launch or what their pricing is going to be. But I'll reiterate what I said earlier, and that is we're fully aligned with our partners at 21st Century Fox on plans to launch, on what their user interface is, on what their approach is in terms of the overall package. We'll have individual negotiations with them for our channels, of course. But we like their strategy from a pricing perspective and in terms of what their ultimate consumer offering or consumer proposition is. I don't think I'll comment much about what we're doing on the SVOD space. This is still a very dynamic marketplace and we continue to look for opportunities to sell our content. I will say that we've never seen a better marketplace to sell intellectual property into. And the strategy that we deployed a while ago to invest in the creation of intellectual property is one that we believe in even more today, and we're going to continue to invest more in creating intellectual property. And one of the best examples of that would be Marvel and what we've been able to do with Netflix in terms of multiple original series, renewal of second seasons on two of them, and the addition of another series from Marvel to Netflix. And the fact that Marvel's been in discussions with other distributors as well. And so demand on their product is pretty significant. Plus, we're looking at obviously continuing to invest under the ABC banner, under the Disney banner and potentially under the Lucas banner. So there are many opportunities for us to sell content to a fairly voracious marketplace right now for that content.\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: And can I just \u2013 one other follow-up on Shanghai. You mentioned the dynamic pricing. Can you just talk about how much of a difference there might be from peak to the low seasonal period? And also, what the impact of having the park will be, because when you talked about the movies, you talked about how well they did \u2013 the recent movies in China. Obviously, having the park (32:58) in this promotion should help that even further. So maybe just the overall ripple effect that you should get once the park fully opens?\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: The pricing that we have in China is for basically peak and off-peak periods, and there are more off-peak days than there are peak days. There's roughly a $20 differential between peak and off-peak, and then somewhere in the neighborhood of $76 a day for the peak and $56 for the off-peak. There's also some pricing for children and some pricing for senior citizens. And the reaction to the pricing has actually been quite positive so far as well as reaction to the pricing for our hotels and the pricing for The Lion King show, which is a Mandarin-produced Lion King. It is the full sort of Broadway show, but it is a separate ticket and so far, so good. We've actually had no negative reactions whatsoever to our pricing approach. The value of our intellectual property in China is on the rise. That's obviously, as you noted, Jessica, evident in how our movies are doing. It's having a very positive impact on our brand and our brands that would include Disney and Marvel, in particular. We do have a Marvel presence in the park. It will grow over time, so there will be all kinds of opportunities particularly for character interaction with Marvel characters. I noted with interest in a recent visit to Disneyland here in California that there was a line early in the morning for our guests to meet Zootopia characters. I can tell you that Zootopia having done so well in China, there will be Zootopia characters in our park in China sooner than we had initially anticipated. But in general, you're going to find a park that is going to take advantage of what is clearly a growing interest in our intellectual property as well as a blend of some original intellectual property too. We wanted this park to be unique and that it would have things that our other parks in our other locations around the world didn't have. But it's definitely a blend.\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Thanks, Jessica. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Omar Sheikh from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nOmar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. Just a couple of questions. First, for Christine, going back to Consumer Products if I could, could you maybe let us know what the Infinity as it annualized revenue and operating income contributed by Infinity was, so we know what to strip out going forward? And also maybe what the FX headwind was in the quarter for Consumer Products? That would be helpful. And then a question for Bob, and I know there's been some press reports about your potential interest in MLB's BAM unit. I wonder whether you could, well, A, perhaps comment on that if you care to? But just maybe more broadly, could you maybe update us on your thinking on potentially taking some of the contracts or content that you have control over, and taking it direct-to-consumer? Thanks.\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President: Thanks, Omar. On Infinity, we don't disclose those numbers by product. But I will answer your question on foreign exchange headwinds for the segment. In this quarter, the FX impact on Consumer Products was $18 million. But I also want to reiterate that our forecast for the year-over-year change, which we gave you previously of 500 (36:32) for the year, is still the same outlook and we're not making any change to that. And that's for the entire company.\nOmar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Omar, I'm not really going to make a specific comment about our interest in acquiring a stake in BAM. I will say that we've been very impressed with their product. It's obviously quite evident if you have engaged with Major League Baseball on digital platforms, probably among the best out there. On the direct-to-consumer front, we've talked about this often. We're blessed with brands and products that give us the opportunity to take them direct-to-consumer. It's not always that simple. In that we have agreements with current distributors that have to be considered, although they don't go forever. And obviously, we have to get it right from a technology perspective. I will say that the product that we launched in the U.K., DisneyLife, which was deemed experimental on our part because we really wanted to see not only how consumers behave with the product, but what the pricing should be and whether the technology platform that we created for it to put it on would work, and we've been really encouraged by that. We've had great consumer reviews and we're pleased to say that the transition from basically free to pay has gone really well, too. And so we're looking at other opportunities around the world to distribute that product to. There has also been great interest in our movies and our television shows on the platform. But interestingly enough, as time has passed and people are using it more, we're finding they're going to our books, our games, our music as well. So it's a good product. It seems to be working, and we think there are more opportunities for it.\nOmar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Very clear. Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Omar, thanks for the questions. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from UBS. Please go ahead.\nDoug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks so much. I had one for Bob and one for Christine. I'll just ask them both upfront I think. Bob, you've got a lot of discussion already on the call about I guess we're calling them OTT MVPDs for now. We need a better acronym for sure, I think. But I'm interested in the advertising side for IP streaming world. Has Disney been rethinking advertising models, including ad loads as your vision for the future of TV advertising informed your strategy for the Media Networks division? And for Christine, the 5% hotel bookings pacing for the June quarter, that's despite the tough Easter comparison, so the core trend would actually be better than that, am I thinking about that right? Thanks.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I mentioned earlier, Doug, what a dynamic marketplace it is, and I was referring to distribution opportunities, but the same thing would apply on the advertising front. And Ben Sherwood and I had a discussion yesterday about this as it related to the non-ESPN Media Networks. And just about everything is on the table right now including ad load and pricing and advertising integration into programming as a for instance. And I think you're going to see just a lot of shifting in terms of not only what we're selling but how advertisers are buying into all different kinds of television product. I don't know that right now it's a time to declare anything specific in terms of a strategy because again it's such a changing marketplace, except to say that there's strong demand right now for television product and it's obviously evident in how everybody's feeling about the upfront.\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President: And, Doug, to answer your question on the resort bookings to-date for the third quarter being up 5%, that is incorporating our fiscal year impact of Easter the way it fell this year. So the short answer to your question is, yes, it does incorporate that.\nDoug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC: And, Bob, if I could follow up. I mean maybe I'm fishing here a little bit, but you have a much greater exposure to affiliate revenue in your Media Networks business than advertising revenue. Is that a position that you prefer? Do you think affiliate revenue is you've got a lot more visibility over the next five years than advertising revenue? Or do you think perhaps it will end up being the reverse?\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, we're at a very high level when it comes to affiliate revenue. And you're right, in terms of the total number, we do have more exposure as well. We have in the past preferred that to advertising, although there's nothing wrong with advertising. We certainly drive a lot of it because of the certainty. Obviously, with the discussion that's been in the marketplace about the shifting dynamics of distribution and to some extent some of the sub erosion, that would perhaps call some of that into question. But, we would still take our hand in terms of being more subscription-centric than advertising-centric because of \u2013 that we still believe there's much more certainty in that than advertising which as you know, has tended to be somewhat cyclical in nature, at times could be fickle in nature based on a variety of other conditions. And as we look at distribution, we still think that there's huge demand for these channels, particularly in the United States but worldwide as well. And while consumers are clearly shifting their habits in terms of television, we still think that the subscription channel model is going to dominate the marketplace for certainly the next five years, if not many years thereafter.\nDoug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks so much.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Hey, Doug, thanks for those questions. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. One for Bob and a follow-up for Christine. Bob, can you talk a little bit about how you're looking at the Sling product map, roadmap? DISH talked on their call about wanting to bring Disney's channels into their multi-stream service. And you've been quite complementary of the single-stream product lately. I'm just wondering how you feel about, A, them offering two different products in the marketplace shortly; and B, what are the puts and takes to including your networks in the multi-stream product, whether the Hulu plans sort of impact your thought process there? And then I have a quick follow-up for Christine.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: When we initially launched on Sling, we liked the single-stream. It was a new product and we wanted to be careful about the impact of that on our bigger business. When Sling decided to launch the multi-stream product, we were unable to conclude an agreement with them right away, meaning to launch with them when they launched the product. But they've subsequently come back and engaged with us. In fact, I talked to Charlie Ergen \u2013 I met with Charlie Ergen personally a couple of weeks ago and we're engaged in discussions with him about possibly being included in the new product in the future. But I don't want to comment more on those discussions. And I don't think Hulu, at least from our perspective, didn't have an impact on it at all. We're looking for multiple opportunities to distribute our product, new platforms because as I said earlier, we like what the new platforms offer to consumers. And we'll continue to look pretty expansively at current and new entrants in the marketplace. And we believe there will be even newer entrants in the marketplace, Hulu being included in the months and years ahead.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then, Christine, just going back to Cable, would you be able to give us the domestic affiliate revenue growth for the quarter? And should we be thinking that you're reiterating the three-year CAGR on OI for Cable, which I think is mid-single digits? Is that still what we should be thinking about with two quarters left?\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President: Yes. The domestic Cable affiliate revenue outlook that was updated last August of high single digits is still intact. And that, as you know, is from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2016 on a compounded annual rate. So that is still intact.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And the OI? Sorry.\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President: Oh, and the OI. That component of the outlook is intact as well. That was Cable operating income up mid-single digits over that same time period, still on a compounded annual growth rate.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay.\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President: And on the domestic Cable affiliate revenue growth, this quarter as well as last quarter we gave you total Media Networks and total Cable affiliate revenue growth. And we gave you some color on the Broadcasting affiliate revenue growth as well. We won't be providing domestic Cable affiliate revenue growth. We manage our Media businesses collectively and we negotiate our affiliate agreements on a consolidated basis, and that's how we're going to report the affiliate revenue.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay.\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President: And if you recall, we started providing domestic Cable affiliate revenue because there were a number of business model changes with our international networks. But that created some noise in our affiliate growth comparisons and those changes are largely behind us.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President: Okay? Thank you.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Thanks, Ben. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi. Please go ahead.\nJason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Just a question for Mr. Iger. I think even before the decision to shutter Infinity, we were at least getting questions from institutional investors about Disney acquiring a console or a video game company I should say. I'm not going to ask you to comment on that, but can you just refresh us in terms of what caused you to start as a licenser of your content, pivot into consoles, and now move back into licensing and what the lessons learned were?\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, we thought we had a really good opportunity to launch our own product in that space. I realize it was console space, but it was also essentially \u2013 a large component of it was the toys \u2013 they call it toys-to-life space, the toys-to-life business. And, in fact, we did quite well with the first iteration of it. And we did okay with the second iteration, but that business is a changing business, and we did not have enough confidence in the business in terms of it being stable enough to stay in it from a self-publishing perspective. You know that you take on substantially more risk, particularly when it comes to manufacturing and managing the inventory, the toy inventory of that business. And in fact, as Christine noted, a good part of the write-off that we just announced comes from having to write-off that inventory that we took responsibility for when we went into the publishing business. And we just feel that it's a changing space and that we're just better off at managing the risk that that business delivers by licensing instead of publishing. It's just that simple. We did fine with the product initially. We actually made a good product. I give the developers a lot of credit for the product that they made. It was extremely well received. But we knew going in that there would be a lot of risk with this product, and the fact that we did so well initially, gave us the confidence to continue with it. The truth of the matter is that the risk that we cited at the beginning when we went into this caught up with us.\nJason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, all right, very good. Thank you.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Jason, thanks for the question. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nTodd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Like most people, one for Christine, and hopefully one for Bob. Christine, on the A&E equity income, I just wonder \u2013 I know there is a lot of puts and takes there, and a new one with VICE. So, I just hoped you might be able to \u2013 willing to comment on whether sort of this quarter was emblematic of how it's going to look for a while with the start-up move there, with your partner at VICE, or anything else we should be thinking about in terms of advertising affiliate that would affect that equity income for the next many quarters? And then, Bob, if you don't mind, I'd love to hear your thoughts on ABC. You mentioned a conversation with Ben Sherwood before. You've got new leadership at ABC. When you think about what you're hoping Ben will accomplish there, and what sort of his marching orders are, given all the changes in attracting primetime audiences and advertising, and the backend value of content, what are we hoping to see there? What should we be looking for to see if it's on track and delivering what you're hoping? Thanks for your thoughts.\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President: Okay, I'll take the first one, Todd, on A&E. As you noted, A&E was down year-over-year. The biggest driver of that was a decrease in ad revenue coupled with an increase in programming expense. And as you mentioned, with VICE being in there as well, there was a negative impact of the conversion of the H2 channel to VICELAND that factored through A&E's numbers. And VICELAND as you know recently launched and it's still in a start-up phase. So I think you have to give them time to get up to speed. And A&E is dealing with some aging shows and putting on new programming. And so this is just something that we'll be watching on a quarterly basis.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Todd, on the ABC front, first of all, I obviously like the management changes that were made. I've known Channing Dungey for a long time. Putting her in charge of primetime programming I think is a great move, and I have the utmost confidence in Ben as well. I don't know that there's a big headline here. I've said to Ben \u2013 what I've said publicly, and Ben and I are both in accord on this, and that is that you have to look at the business as not just a distribution or a network business, but as a content creation business, too. And ABC, under ABC Productions, has done a great job of creating content that is leverageable beyond the ABC network into a world that has an unbelievable appetite for that content. And that's not just domestic; that's globally as well. So, the goal at ABC is to program the network aggressively, but to also support our Studio operation aggressively because that is a very, very important, if not integral, component of the value chain. The obvious is the most obvious and that is make great programming. These days, there is so much \u2013 there are so many more series that are available to consumers. And it puts a tremendous amount of pressure on programmers, not only to make things great but to make things that make noise that stand out and that's I think again, a given. The other thing that I've mentioned is I don't think he should be held back by any of the old rules and he should think out of the box. The world has changed so much that the old rules just don't always apply, and he needs to I think consider that. And that's about it. I've seen all the pilots this year. I had the ability to watch most of them while I was in China last week, believe it or not, and I like what I see. And as I said earlier, I like the marketplace. And I think given the ownership of programming and the fact that a lot of these new shows are ours and a lot of the shows that we put on last year, including Quantico, that has done quite well \u2013 are ours. I feel good about the prospects for that business.\nTodd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Thanks, Todd. Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Okay. And our final question comes from David Miller from Topeka Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDavid W. Miller - Topeka Capital Markets: Yes, thanks. Just one for Christine, looking at the Park margins here of 15.9%, truly outstanding for a fiscal Q2, just given that fiscal Q2 is usually your weakest quarter. Christine, in your opinion, how much of this is due to MyMagic+? How much of a contributor is that, just given that the design of MyMagic+ was to just get people moving around more, get people to have a more efficient experience, if you will, around the Parks? Just curious what the contribution was, if there's any way you can quantify it? Thank you.\nChristine M. McCarthy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President: Thanks, David. MyMagic+ has been around for several quarters and a few years, so it's really been incorporated into the base business in the way the Parks manages their business. So I think another way of looking at Parks' margins is to look at the strength of the domestic operations this quarter. And as you noted, the 15.9% was a total segment, including our international operations but that the domestic business was up 20% in OI and their margins were up 300 basis points. So it's part of the way we do our business, but the business domestically has done extremely well.\nDavid W. Miller - Topeka Capital Markets: Okay, wonderful. Thank you very much.\nRobert A. Iger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I want to add one thing. I'm actually kind of surprised that after almost 45 minutes of questioning, we didn't get one question about our Studio. But I just want to reiterate that the Studio's results were up tremendously in the quarter and up over 60% for the first two quarters of the year. They've had three movies in the marketplace, just recently, Zootopia, which is well over $900 million worldwide; Jungle Book, which is well over $700 million worldwide and climbing; and then Captain America, which had one of the best openings any movie has had in the history of the business. And their slate going forward is just fantastic whether you're looking at Disney Live Action, Disney Animation and Pixar or Marvel and Lucas. And I just feel that we've done a lot of work as a company to grow that business. In fact, Studio OI for the first half of the year is over $1.5 billion. And I just want to make sure that we give credit where credit is due to a studio that has done a fantastic job and it is firing on more than all cylinders. Thank you.\nLowell Singer - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations: Bob, thanks. That really does conclude today's call.

My name is Bianca and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to your host, Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Singer, you may begin.\nLowell Singer: Good afternoon and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's first quarter 2016 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 40 minutes ago and is available on our website, at www.Disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and a replay and a transcript will be available on our website. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Staggs, Chief Operating Officer and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob, Tom and Christine will each make some comments and then, of course, we will be happy to take your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob and we'll get started.\nBob Iger: Thank you, Lowell and good afternoon, everyone. I am thrilled to announce that our Q1 performance was the greatest single quarter in the history of The Walt Disney Company and a phenomenal start to FY '16. Revenue was up 14%, net income was up 32% and adjusted earnings per share were up 28%, to $1.63 which is our highest quarterly EPS ever and is also our 10th consecutive quarter of double digit EPS growth. We had tremendous performance across our portfolio of businesses. With the incredible success of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, our studio delivered $1 billion in quarterly operating income for the first time in history. Our parks and resorts also made history, with nearly $1 billion in operating income. And our consumer products and Interactive business set another record, with $860 million in OI. Our results clearly show that our long-term strategic focus and investments in brands and franchises are driving remarkable value in these businesses, greatly increasing their impact on the Company and further diversifying our future growth. Over the last 10 years, we've built an enviable collection of vibrant, valued and admired brands. We've also created, acquired or re-envisioned several of the world's most valuable franchises and we're fully leveraging these assets across our portfolio of businesses and around the globe. Of course, nothing reflects the impact of this strategy better than the phenomenal resurgence of the Star Wars franchise. And there is no better way to propel this franchise into the future than producing quality products. It's been absolutely thrilling to see the reaction to our first Star Wars feature film, The Force Awakens. Audiences and critics alike really love this movie. It's the only film in history to ever reach $900 million in domestic box office; and as you may have heard, it crossed $2 billion in global box office over the weekend, more than doubling the worldwide box office for the last Star Wars release a decade ago. Breaking records at the box office is only the beginning. Global retail sales for Star Wars merchandise in the first quarter exceeded $3 billion, more than triple the global retail for this franchise in Q1 of last year. Star Wars is also driving unprecedented growth for our mobile games and EA's launch of Star Wars Battlefront was the biggest video game release in Star Wars history, with more than 13 million units sold. Filming of Star Wars: Episode 8, the next chapter of the legendary saga, has just commenced and it will be in theaters December, 2017. And production of Episode, a 2019 release, has also begun. In the meantime, we will keep fans engaged in the Star Wars universe and further expand the franchise with the release of Rogue One this coming December. It's a compelling and original stand-alone story about a band of rebels attempting to steal the plans for the Death Star, set just prior to the events in the first Star Wars movie, Episode 4: A New Hope. Filming of Rogue One is virtually completed and we absolutely love what we've seen so far. This is the first of a set of planned stand-alone stories and we're already in preproduction on our next one, for release in May of 2018. And on the Parks front, later this year we will break ground on spectacular new Star Wars theme lands in Disneyland and Walt Disney World. Clearly, Q1 saw the impact of our extremely successful relaunch of the Star Wars franchise, as well as its enormous potential to drive value across our entire Company for the foreseeable future. Given our unparalleled mix of some of the world's best IP and strongest brands, we're well positioned for continued growth over the long term, regardless of changing dynamics in the media landscape. Turning to a subject that has gotten a lot of attention lately, ESPN and the status of the bundle. In the last couple of months, we have actually seen an uptick in ESPN subs which is encouraging. We're also pleased with what we're hearing from Dish about the response to Sling TV, a light package that includes ESPN. The service appears to be growing nicely and is proving very attractive to young consumers in particular, significantly over indexing among millennials and has been quite successful in bringing previous cord cutters back to pay TV, along with new subscribers. Sling TV is clearly additive to the robust MVPD universe and our networks benefit accordingly. The popularity of sports and the strength of ESPN add great value for consumers who want lighter packages and we're currently in discussions with new and existing distribution partners to create an array of innovative new services and light packages featuring ESPN. We will continue to focus on subscriber trends, moving quickly to embrace and create opportunities to drive value in the evolving market. It's interesting to note that Nielsen has significantly lowered its estimate of losses of multi-channel households in 2015. Regardless, in any market, we believe ESPN is well positioned to continue to thrive for many reasons, including the demand for sports programming, especially live sports, is undiminished and consumption is at an all-time high. Last year, 95% of Americans with a multi-channel bundle watched sports and 81% of those viewers watched ESPN content. Across all platforms, more than 200 million adults engage with ESPN in an average month. In other words, four out of five adults in this country connect with ESPN on some platform every month, usually more than one. ESPN has the sports that most people want. It holds more national sports rights than all other sports media combined and it has the most important rights secured into the next decade, including the NFL, the NBA, Major League Baseball and the most coveted college sports. Consumers, advertisers and operators see great value in ESPN. The vast majority of consumers still see tremendous value in the multi-channel universe and they consistently rank ESPN as the number one or number two most valuable channel within it. ESPN's ad revenue continues to grow, thanks to its proven ability to reach audiences that advertisers value most. In fact, ESPN's ad sales significantly outpaced the market, growing three times faster than television advertising overall over the last six years. MVPD's just ranked ESPN number one in perceived value for the 16th year in a row, due in part to the fact that ESPN drives more local ad sales and broadband subscriptions than any other service in the market. The expanded basic bundle will remain the dominant product for consumers for the foreseeable future, but competition from new video services and products will only grow. Better user interfaces and greater mobility make these newer services enormously appealing, especially among young people and many of our brands, including Disney, Marvel, Star Wars and ESPN, are tailor-made for over-the-top direct-to-consumer app-based video products. So expect innovation and continued pursuit of new distribution opportunities. Our results this quarter clearly demonstrate that our focus on high quality branded content and franchises to diversify our asset mix, our ability to use technology to aggressively create new opportunities and our ambitious global growth are paying off with record performance. We're proud of our achievements, we're excited about the future and we're confident in our ability to continue to drive growth across the entire Company. I am going to turn the call over to Tom to walk you through some highlights across the Company and then Christine will take you through the details of our performance in Q1. Tom?\nTom Staggs: Thank you, Bob. Hello, everyone. As Bob just highlighted, the strength of our branded programming networks gives us confidence in our ability to continue to grow our media networks business. In addition, the marketplace offers a range of other new opportunities for us. They include our continued investment in the future of Hulu as both a compelling consumer platform and another active buyer of high quality content, our investment in and collaboration with Vice, our distribution agreement with Ali Baba for Disney Life in China and ESPN's [indiscernible] with Tencent in China, as well. Our opportunistic approach also led to our successful Marvel series on Netflix which helps extend the Marvel franchise and broaden its reach. As importantly, after a decade of strategic value-creating acquisitions and capital allocation, our other businesses have grown significantly, increasing their impact on our results. This purposeful diversification across branded franchises with attractive long-term potential, along with an aggressive approach towards leveraging new technologies and driving global growth, are the key strategies we laid out a decade ago. With branded content from Disney, ESPN, ABC, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars, we have the most valuable collection of branded franchises and other high impact IP in the world and few companies have embraced the promise of new technology as enthusiastically and effectively as ours. The strategies are bearing significant fruit today, continue to guide our path for the future. We have invested heavily over the last several years to significantly expand our parks and resorts business. Those efforts include the creation of Cars Land and transformation of Disney California Adventure, introducing My Magic Plus and doubling the size of Fantasy Land at Walt Disney World, doubling the size of our cruise fleet and adding three new lands in Hong Kong. The record results for the quarter which include all-time high global attendance, record results for our domestic parks and our best Q1 results ever for Disney Cruise Line, reflect the impacts and value creation of these investments. We're already benefiting from the success of Star Wars at our parks, as well. Since December, more than 6 million guests have experienced new and refreshed Star Wars attractions and features in our parks. And this year, we're rolling out even more themed attractions in parks and resorts around the world, including Star Wars Day at Sea which debuted on the Disney Fantasy last month. Our most important single new initiative at Parks is Shanghai Disneyland which will have its grand opening on June 16. Tickets will officially go on sale March 28, an announcement that has been incredibly well-received in China. Bob and I were just over there and we couldn't be more pleased or excited with how well our preparations are going. Thousands of new cast members have already been hired, ride testing has started on the attractions and the anticipation is palpable and growing. Shanghai Disney Resort is going to be a tremendous source of pride for everyone involved. It's one of the most extraordinarily creative and innovative projects in the history of our Company which makes it the perfect way to firmly establish Disney in the hearts and minds of the people of China, as well as an attractive and profitable place to deploy our capital for the long term. Our franchise focused strategy is driving growth across the Company, including our consumer products and interactive business. Star Wars was obviously a huge driver of consumer products and interactive results for the quarter, but it wasn't the only one. We're also very pleased with licensing growth this quarter from Marvel, led by Avengers. As we've discussed previously, we have 11 franchises that generated more than $1 billion each in annual retail sales for the last two fiscal years, making our consumer products business uniquely broad and deep. Our acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm give us some of the most valuable IP in the world. They also brought some of the world's most gifted storytellers and innovators to Disney, unlocking even more creative potential across the Company. Bob touched on the ambitious slate of upcoming Star Wars films, but that's just one aspect of our incredible studio's pipeline. We have two films from Disney Feature Animation this calendar year, starting with Disney Animation's Zootopia, an incredibly original, charming and very funny movie opening March 4. This Thanksgiving, we will release Moana, a comedy adventure with incredible music, very much in keeping with the tremendous legacy of Disney Animation. As you know, a sequel of Frozen is in the works. In the meantime, Disney Animation is creating the first ever Frozen television special which will air on ABC during the 2017 holiday season. And, following the tradition of Lion King, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, we have a new Frozen stage musical slated for Broadway in 2018. Turning back to Animation, we just celebrated the 10th anniversary of our Pixar acquisition. Pixar and our incredibly talented colleagues there have positively impacted every aspect of our Company and contributed mightily to our success. Looking ahead, Pixar has as strong a line up and of films as we've ever seen. Finding Dory, the long-awaited sequel to Pixar's beloved movie Finding Nemo, opens this June. 2017 will bring us Cars 3, plus another Pixar original film set in Latin America called Cocoa. In 2018 comes Toy Story 4, followed by Incredibles 2 in 2019. From Disney Live Action, this April will bring Mowgli, Balou and a host of other classic characters to life in a new way with the release of The Jungle Book. Johnny Depp returns this May as the Mad Hatter in Alice Through the Looking Glass and again in 2017 as Jack Sparrow for a fifth installment in the hugely successful Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. 2017 will also feature Disney's live-action version of Beauty and the Beast. In addition, we have a fantastic slate of Marvel movies that extends through the end of the decade. Captain America and Ironman face off in an epic battle when Captain America: Civil War opens in May. The movie features some of the most popular Marvel heroes and we believe it will prove to be one of our best Marvel movies yet. In November, we're launching another compelling character into the Marvel cinematic universe with the release of Dr. Strange, starring Benedict Cumberbatch. Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy return next year, along with Thor: Ragnarok. In 2018, we will release three more Marvel movies, Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War and Antman and The Wasp. And with more than 7,000 characters in the Marvel universe, you can expect the Marvel storytelling to continue. We're excited about the future of all of our great brands and the opportunity they provide to drive continued growth and value for our Company across our businesses, around the world and through platforms both old and new. Now, I will turn the call over to Christine to walk you through our results in more detail. Christine?\nChristine McCarthy: Thank you, Tom and good afternoon, everyone. It's worth noting again, FY '16 is off to a phenomenal start. We delivered strong revenue growth, up 14% during the first quarter to a record $15.2 billion. Earnings per share, excluding items affecting comparability, were up 28%, to a record $1.63. Studio entertainment had its most profitable quarter ever and that's following record full year results in FY '15. Operating income was up 86%, to over $ 1 billion. The growth in operating income was primarily due to the fantastic worldwide theatrical performance of Star Wars The Force Awakens. Home entertainment and television distribution results were also up in the quarter, demonstrating our studio strategy continues to create value beyond the theatrical window. The success of Star Wars at the box office also drove increased demand for Star Wars merchandise. Operating income at the recently combined Disney consumer products and interactive media segment was up 23% and segment margins were up over 500 basis points, to 45%, driven by the growth in merchandise licensing and games, primarily on the strength of Star Wars. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up an impressive 23% in the first quarter and that doesn't include the deferred revenue from Star Wars: Episode 7 merchandise sold in the fourth quarter last year. The growth in games was due to higher licensing revenue from Star Wars Battlefront, partially offset by lower Infinity results. The Disney Stores also benefited from sales of Star Wars merchandise; however, the increase in the quarter was offset by very strong sales of Frozen merchandise in Q1 last year. At parks and resorts, operating income was up 22% in the first quarter and reflects the favorable timing of the New Year's holiday period relative to our fiscal calendar which we discussed on last quarter's call. We estimate this shifted about $9 million in operating income into Q1 this year that was recognized in 2Q last year. Our domestic operations had another great quarter. We continue to see strong demand from guests, specifically at our domestic parks and at Disney Cruise Line. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 10% in the quarter and per capita spending was up 7% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 9% and occupancy was up 3 percentage points, to 92%. Our Cruise business had its best Q1 ever, driven by higher ticket pricing and onboard spending. And that's despite a three-week dry dock of the Disney Dream. Growth in domestic operations was partially offset by a decline at our international parks, as a result of lower operating income at Disneyland Paris which was closed for four days in November, as well as pre opening spending at Shanghai. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 2% compared to prior-year levels, while booked rates are up 4%. At media networks, operating income was lower in the first quarter compared to prior year; however, operating income would have grown in line with the 8% revenue growth we delivered when adjusted for the timing of the college football playoffs and an adverse impact from foreign exchange. Results in our cable business were lower in the first quarter, as higher programming and production costs offset increases in advertising and affiliate revenue. The higher costs in Q1 which we discussed during our Q4 earnings call, were due to the timing of the six New Year's Eve and New Year's Day college football playoff bowl games, including the two semifinal games which aired on ESPN. These games aired during the first fiscal quarter this year, whereas they aired during the second fiscal quarter last year. Higher programming and production costs also reflect contractual rate increases for key sports rights, including the NFL and college football, partially offset by the absence of rights costs for NASCAR. Advertising revenue at ESPN was up almost 25% in the quarter, reflecting the timing of the six bowl games, as well as the strong advertising marketplace for sports in general. We estimate that ESPN's ad revenue would have been up about 14% adjusted for the timing of the bowl games and the absence of NASCAR. Underlying ad trends remain very strong; however, due to the timing of the college football playoff, ad sales are pacing down in the second quarter versus prior year. Broadcasting operating income was down in the first quarter, as growth in affiliate and advertising revenue was more than offset by higher programming costs and increased equity losses from our investment in Hulu. Ad revenue at the ABC network was up 8% in the first quarter, due to an increase in units sold, higher rates and a shift in the timing of New Year's Eve programming to Q1, offset somewhat by lower ratings. So far this quarter, scatter pricing at the network is pacing high teens above upfront levels. Media networks' affiliate revenue was up for 4% in the first quarter, driven by a 7 percentage point increase in rate, partially offset by roughly a 2 percentage point decrease due to lower subs and a 2 point decrease from unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Broadcasting affiliate revenue was up more than the segment average, while cable affiliate revenue, adjusted for FX, was up approximately 3.5%. Recall that we have fully lapped the launch of the SEC network and don't have any major affiliate agreement renewals in FY '16. During the first quarter, we repurchased 21.1 million shares for $2.4 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased about 35.5 million shares for approximately $3.8 billion. Overall, we feel great about the start of the fiscal year. Our strategy of investing in high quality content, supported by the best brands in media, continues to pay off. We're mindful of the evolutionary changes taking place in our industry and we feel we're well positioned to thrive in this evolving landscape, due to the strength, depth and diversity of our businesses. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Lowell for Q&A.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Christine. Operator, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we\u2019ve our first question from UBS we have Doug Mitchelson. Doug, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDoug Mitchelson: Two questions, one, Bob, you outlined the record results at Film, Consumer Products and Theme Parks. And I think investors are wondering, can it get any better than this? If you could help us understand what the drivers of growth going forward in that business might be. Tom ran us through all the content that's coming. But are there particular initiatives that increase efficiency or is this just you think content in the future will continue to be better and better? And then any clarification on the cable network affiliate fee growth, 3.5% ex FX, are you guys confident as you look for that revenue growth in the cable network business will be in line to ahead of operating expenses on a go forward basis, if that makes sense?\nBob Iger: Well, we're not going to give guidance, Doug. But I will start by saying, as a response to the second part of your question, that we fully expect our media networks, including ESPN, to continue to deliver bottom line growth which means that revenue growth is going to outpace spending. Obviously, we're not going to give guidance on Film and Parks and Consumer Products, but I think you should look at a few things. First of all, the intellectual property cycle is not only robust, but in some cases, really still growing. If you look at Star Wars and you look at Marvel as examples of that. But we've got an incredible pipeline, as Tom outlined earlier, of Pixar and Disney animated films and Disney live-action. And we also know that those films drive a lot of business across Parks and Resorts and Consumer Products. So I would say that the studio will continue to provide more growth opportunities for the Company and that includes growth internationally, because China continues to grow as a market. Consumer Products is really great story for this quarter, because that is one business that while it did benefit significantly from Star Wars, we also saw continued success from other franchises and growth, notably Marvel which is a great sign. We expected that Star Wars was going to cannibalize some of our other franchises more and it didn't materialize. And lastly on the Parks front, we have, obviously, plans to build out. Domestically, we're building Avatar Land and we're breaking ground, in fact soon, on Star Wars Lands in the two domestic parks. And with Shanghai coming on board in June, while there are start-up costs this year, you can expect that that's going to drive growth for Parks and Resorts for many years to come. So we feel really good about how all four of our businesses are positioned. And then I think you have to also consider what the media landscape looks like and that is that there is a voracious appetite for high quality intellectual property, especially branded. And there isn't a new platform that launches is not interested in licensing or gaining access to our channels or to our intellectual property. And we believe that we're going to see continued expansion across the world in new platforms and that will create opportunities for us to grow.\nOperator: From Moffat Nathanson we have Michael Nathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nathanson: I have two for Bob. First one is on ESPN. Bob, could you go back and clear up the differences in an answer you gave in August about what you thought the source of ESPN subscriber clients were versus what Skipper said in the Journal about skinny bundles? We want to understand, how much do you think the decline is from cord cutting versus skinny bundles? I wanted to put those two comments together.\nBob Iger: It was a timing issue. At the time that I made the comments last August, we were seeing some sub erosion from both sides, from skinny bundles and from essentially a decrease in the total number of subs. At the time, because of what Nielsen was telling us, we concluded that most of it was coming from simple loss of subs. Once Nielsen corrected those numbers, reducing the loss of subs by some 2 million subscribers -- or 2 million households, I should say -- we concluded that, at that point, our sub loss was largely due to the fact that ESPN was not part of skinny bundles that had launched.\nMichael Nathanson: Okay. And then you mentioned this $3 billion Star Wars Consumer Products. One of the questions we wanted to understand is, what do you think the tail is on Star Wars? Will it look like Frozen, where it gets stronger as consumers become more familiar with the product or do you think it's more akin to tied to the release dates of these movies?\nBob Iger: Look, Star Wars has always been one of the most popular franchises in the world. And when we acquired it in 2012 all the way up to September, we saw some pretty robust sales of Star Wars merchandise, even though a film had not been in the marketplace since 2005. So we knew that when we brought a film out, it was going to greatly enhance sales of Star Wars merchandise; and not only did it do that, but it did it well beyond what our expectations were. Don't forget, we did not bring new merchandise out for Star Wars until September 4 and the movie came out in December. So we're still seeing quite a significant tail, even in this quarter, from the sale of Star Wars merchandise across the world. And by the way, one thing that's very interesting is, that is not just a U.S. phenomenon. And in fact, we saw some pretty interesting consumer product sales, even in markets where the movie didn't perform as well as either we had hoped or as well as other markets. So with \"Rogue One\" coming out at the end of this year and then Star Wars 8 and 9 planned for 2017 -- meaning calendar year -- and for 2019 and another stand-alone film, we think that while I don't want to predict that it's going to be steady state, that we're not seeing something aberrational right now, but what we're seeing is the establishment of an old franchise but at a much higher level in terms of global interest and sales.\nOperator: From JPMorgan we have Alexia Quadrani. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani: I just have one on Parks and then a follow-up on Cable. First on Parks, we've seen another great quarter of very strong profit growth at Disney's domestic parks. I'm trying to get a sense of how much longer that impressive growth can continue and any color you can provide on how we should think about profitability for the rest of this year, given all the moving pieces with Shanghai. And then a follow-up on Cable, just wanted to check and make sure that you are still comfortable with the high single digit affiliate revenue CAGR over the next three year's guidance.\nTom Staggs: Alexia, it's Tom. Let me talk about the Parks. Bob mentioned that we have broken ground on the two Star Wars Lands. And of course, we think that's going to be a nice catalyst down the road. Before that, we will open Avatar at Walt Disney World. So we have a cadence of new attractions here domestically that we think guests will really embrace. I think we also see opportunities, given the strong occupancy of room nights that we see, to consider expanding our hotel capacity down the road. So I think there are many avenues for us to continue to grow that business. Of course, Bob talked about Shanghai and the growth that that will drive for us internationally. And remember that while we open this June, we also have significant room for expansion there over time. So we believe that the good news is that guests continue to really embrace our product. We think there's room to grow that product and continue to expand.\nChristine McCarthy: Yes, I will take the second one. Hello, Alexia, it's Christine. In reference to your question about the guidance update that was given in the 3Q call back in August, there is no change to that guidance and we're still very comfortable with it.\nOperator: From Bank of America Merrill Lynch we have Jessica Reif Cohen. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Cohen: Two different questions, on Theme Parks, U.S. demand seems insatiable year after year, driven by, obviously, your intellectual property and new attractions. With China four months away -- and you guys seem very, very excited about it -- how different -- I know you do tons of studies of the market -- how different do you think Chinese consumers will be over the long term, not just into the opening?\nTom Staggs: Well, Jessica, all of our research tells us that our intellectual property and our guest service and our parks experience will resonate extremely well with our Chinese guests. At the same time, we've taken great care to make sure that we designed Shanghai specifically for that marketplace in terms of the layout of the park, the food that we're serving, the type and scripting of the shows that we're putting on. So we're definitely adapting to that market, but we have real confidence that it's going to be a product that's going to resonate and resonate for generations to come.\nJessica Reif Cohen: And then the second question, ESPN, obviously hyper focused by the market. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers of recent sub growth coming from pay TV? Is it more cooperation between programmers and distributors? And secondly, are you close to your minimum thresholds with pay TV operators, meaning, should we be concerned that in your next cycle of contract negotiations, we heard that you said none this year, but is there any concern that the next go round will be more difficult?\nBob Iger: We don't know exactly what the drivers are or were, for the uptick that we've seen recently in terms of sub growth. We believe that we've benefited from the growth of certain light packages that ESPN has been part of, particularly Dish. But I think you have to conclude that sports is very, very popular in this country. And when you look at the percentage of people that access sports on television and across markets and that access it -- across platforms, rather -- and that access it on ESPN, it's among the most, if not the most, popular programming out there. In fact, if you look at the studies that we've done among distributors, it's number one or number two in terms of value creation for them for 16 straight years. If you ask consumers, they say the same thing, it's number one or two in terms of the most valuable channels that they get. So I actually believe -- and I know you want to know about the floors in terms of our agreements -- but I actually believe that this notion that either the expanded basic bundle is experiencing its demise or that ESPN is cratering in any way from a sub perspective is just ridiculous. Sports is too popular. And it's not just at ESPN. Look at how the Super Bowl did, as a for instance which I realize is a penultimate event, but day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year, live sports ends up being among the highest rated programs across television. And ESPN has this incredible, as you know, incredible set of license agreements with all the major sports. It's got the best menu of live sports that is out there. So we actually feel good about it. What we're trying to do now is we're engaging with virtually all of the traditional platform owners in pushing ESPN into light packages. And the success that Dish has experienced we think is a great selling point in that regard. At the same token, we're looking at other opportunities with new platform providers that are emerging in the marketplace. We don't comment on our relationship or a contractual relationship with the distributors, but it's safe to assume, we have not really touched the so-called floor element of those agreements in about 15 years. And we do not foresee, by the way, that the next round of negotiations, whenever they are, are going to be particularly difficult for us, because we come to the table, just with ESPN alone, with a product that people love. And the other thing to note is the value of it from an advertising perspective. ESPN's ad pacing, as Christine mentioned, has been tremendous. And if you look over the last six years, it's advertising growth is three times the growth of television advertising. So you have a product that's great for distributors, it's great for consumers and it's great for advertisers. And I believe really -- I guess, with great confidence, that it's going to thrive in whatever new media world order we're experiencing.\nOperator: From Credit Suisse we have Omar Sheikh. Please go ahead.\nOmar Sheikh: So I'm going to surprise you by not asking a question about ESPN. I've got a couple questions. First, to Bob, if I can and that's on Hulu. I wondered, Bob, if you could just update us on your current thinking on Hulu. How are subs going right now? Where do you think that business can get to in terms of subscribers in the domestic U.S. market? How do you think about potential international expansion? How does it fit into the Disney strategy? I'm interested to hear your thoughts on that. And then the second question, for Christine, maybe. Christine, you mentioned that there were some start-up or pre-opening costs in Shanghai. I wonder if you could just update us on what that number was in the quarter and how we should thinking about perhaps phasing of those costs in the current quarter, as well? Thank you.\nBob Iger: We're bullish on Hulu and that's reflected in the level of investment that we and our other partners are putting into Hulu. First of all, we like new platforms, we like their appeal to young people, particularly millennials. Clearly, the user interface and the mobility of these new platforms is really attractive. It's also a great platform to license our product to and we've actually derived a fair amount of revenue from doing that. We believe that we're going to continue to invest in Hulu and that while I don't want to speak for Hulu completely, their investment strategy is going to be to continue to license off-network movies, et cetera, but also to grow their original programming which they're doing nicely. I don't want to speculate where Hulu goes, but it fits well into Disney's strategy in terms of our investment in new technology platforms and our support of new distribution opportunities.\nChristine McCarthy: On the Shanghai question, back on our last conference call, we said the pre-opening costs, you should expect them to be in the $300 million range. Now that's an annual number. We've not broken them down by quarter, but you can expect those pre-opening costs to ramp into the open which is going to be in mid-June. And also, given that we'll be only fully operational for a little more than three months during the year, the pre-opening expenses will impact the full-year results.\nOperator: From Morgan Stanley we have Ben Swinburne. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne: Christine, can you help us think about expense growth at cable through the rest of the fiscal year? You mentioned that you've now passed the college football peak growth is now behind us. But how should we thinking about that the rest of the year? And then related, Bob, I'm trying to square the subscriber growth comment with the subscriber headwinds in the queue. And I think part of this may be we're talking Nielsen and then paid subs. But are you saying you expect the subscriber headwinds to abate as we move through the next few quarters, given what you're seeing or am I reading too much into that?\nBob Iger: I'll take the second part of the question, then Christine can take the first. What I was talking about in terms of an uptick was recent. So the uptick that we talk about really didn't have much of an impact on this quarter. So what we believe we've seen or what we have seen, recently is that subscriber trends going in the negative direction have abated somewhat. We're not making any predictions about them going forward, because we really don't know. We just feel great about the product and we believe that, again, the protections that many have made are more dire than they should be.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. Ben, on the cable programming costs, as we said on the last conference call, we expect FY '16 cable programming and production costs to be up low to mid-single digits and we're managing, outside of the programming costs, we're managing aggressively other costs at ESPN.\nOperator: From Nomura we have Anthony DiClemente. Please go ahead.\nAnthony DiClemente: First, for Christine, Christine or Bob, just thinking about the Disney balance sheet, it's the strongest in the media industry, it's stronger than most companies in the United States. When you look at what's going on in the economy and the media economy broadly, do you think about your balance sheet as a competitive advantage in any way? And more specifically, what are the things that you can do to utilize the Disney balance sheet, not only financially, but also strategically, whether it be more acquisition of IP, whether it be incremental capital spending on positive ROI projects or whether it be being opportunistic with stock buybacks, given some of the dislocation in the market? Thank you.\nChristine McCarthy: Yes, when you look at the Disney balance sheet, it is the strongest in the media space. There's no question about that. We do view it as an asset. And when we look at the things that we could do with it, your list of acquisitions, investing in our own businesses, having the flexibility to increase buyback, my answer to that would be all of the above. So we do look at the leverage that we have which is a little over one times, the credit rating that we have which is a single A rating, as all being very beneficial for us to be flexible for all sorts of opportunities, as you indicated.\nAnthony DiClemente: Thank you, Christine. And then one for Bob, given the divergence in maybe the narrative, at least, between the non-media side of Disney and the and the media network side, would Disney ever consider separating its businesses into two, with Cable and Broadcast on one side and the Studio, Parks, Consumer Products and Interactive on the other? I guess what the question is getting at is maybe you can just remind us of the synergies between the media networks and the non-media businesses at Disney. Thank you.\nBob Iger: I'm not going to talk about separating those assets. We fully expected that our media assets are going to continue to contribute to our growth. We also are designed, as a Company, to leverage intellectual property across a lot of our businesses or to leverage the collection of brands nicely in the marketplace. And that also is reflected in the way we operate the businesses from an expense perspective, with consolidation in many different areas. So if you look at the profile of the Company, interestingly enough, since 2009, look at the growth profile, the Company has grown on a compounded basis by 14%. The media networks have driven about 8% compounded a year and the rest of the Company grew 23%. So 8% a year is pretty strong. 23% is extraordinary. 14%, pretty damn strong, too. I think that what that says is really, is that over the period of time, we've actually diversified our ability to generate growth and profitability and that was very purposeful. These investments that we made it Pixar and Marvel and in Lucasfilm and the investments that we've made in our parks were designed for us to diversify our bottom line or our growth. And that was not just across businesses, but really across the world, because a lot of these businesses are global in nature, unlike some of our media assets.\nOperator: From Citigroup we have. Jason Bazinet. Please go ahead.\nJason Bazinet: A quick question for Ms. McCarthy, when I look at the buybacks, I think it was a record dollar amount last quarter and second highest, the quarter you just printed. Should investors view that decision to buy back as much stock as you are a function of what you think the intrinsic value of your equity is relative to what it's trading at or is it more a function of the very lean balance sheet and the lack of M&A opportunities, i.e., other, better uses for your cash?\nChristine McCarthy: The way we buy back our stock, we do keep an eye on our intrinsic value. So obviously, the amount of stock we bought [isn't] [ph] an indication that we believe that our stock is a great investment and it is well below that intrinsic value. The strength of the balance sheet does afford us a lot of flexibility, so we're able to react to these opportunities, especially when the market dislocates in our name or the market overall. So we have taken opportunities to be aggressive so far this year and we intend to do it going forward for the balance of the year.\nOperator: From Sanford Bernstein we have Todd Juenger. Please go ahead.\nTodd Juenger: Bob, I want to pick up on the comment you just made, if you don't mind. I was actually playing with the math myself. You talked about the 14% growth since 2009 and the different components of that. Is it wrong to think then that when you talked about an organic growth rate, I'll call it singles and then obviously great contributions from both organic investments in the Parks and M&A delivered something like 14% total growth for the Company. So thinking forward from here, should we think about the Company as a high single grower or do you think the assets you've put in place get you to that double-digit rate that you've had for the past 5-pkus years or will more M&A investment be required? How should we think through the natural growth rate from here? Thank you.\nBob Iger: You should think nothing but happy thoughts about this Company. I don't know what else to say. We're not going to give any guidance whatsoever. We believe that we've distinguished ourselves in the media sector, not only with our growth these last number of years, but with the assets that we've collected and with the growth potential that we've created for this Company going forward. And we will leave it at that.\nTodd Juenger: All right. I didn't mean to ask an unfair question. I understand.\nBob Iger: I didn't take it as unfair, but as you know, we're not going to go there. But I do think it's important -- and I don't mean to be too wordy -- but if you look at the profile of the Company, we have four businesses that are going to deliver growth for this Company, Parks and Resorts, Media Networks, the Studio and Consumer Products. And there was a time not that long ago where we were getting growth really from just a couple of them and some, like the Studio, was somewhat lumpy in nature, meaning there were good years and there were bad, based on the slate. I'm not suggesting that every year we grow, because there will be ups and downs in some cases, but they will be much flatter in nature, meaning you can expect that the bottom line contribution from the businesses will continue on essentially a more consistent basis than you saw in the past.\nTodd Juenger: If you don't mind, a very quick follow-up that follows right in line with that. If you think about the Parks and the exposure to the typicality of a recession, the footprint at the parks have changed a lot since the last recession. Any comment you can make upon the risk to revenue or margins or growth rates, whenever the next recession comes to Parks? Thank you.\nBob Iger: No, I don't think there's anything I can add to that. Sorry.\nOperator: From Guggenheim we have Michael Morris. Please go ahead.\nMichael Morris: Two questions, first on Hulu, can you talk about -- you mentioned you're confident and you feel good about it. Help us understand why you're not concerned that at the $12.00 price point for the ad-free version that it doesn't represent a cannibalization risk to your core business. And then second, if we could talk about the affiliate growth number, the 4% that you just reported. Most of your peers that have television stations have growth significantly above that in their retransmission fees and I'm curious, are you seeing a higher rate in retransmission and therefore, a lower rate on the cable side? What's the balance between those components when we look at that 4%? Thank you.\nBob Iger: Do you want to address that?\nTom Staggs: Christine took you through the relative growth on the affiliate fees. And we're very pleased with where we've been going on the retransmission side of the equation, in fact, we're well ahead of the guidance we gave some time ago and expect that growth to continue. So we feel very good about that and the relative contribution between the two. So I don't really want to address the nature of the growth at other companies, the mix is often different and they're coming off of different basis, as well. With regard to Hulu -- look, the Hulu business model has evolved over time and continues to. We've noticed they have added subscribers rather nicely. That has not been overly driven by the ad-free portion of the equation. That's actually a small part of the subscriber base. And at this point, we're not overly concerned with the impact of that to the ecosystem as a whole. We will obviously keep our eye on it. And as Bob has indicated previously, we take a balanced approach to both those businesses and then also how we think about positioning our programming within them and we will continue to do that.\nMichael Morris: And just back to the first question or I guess, maybe my second -- on the growth rate. Was there anything unusual in the first quarter that impacted that 4% growth rate or is that, as you're looking at what we're seeing right now, a fair run rate maybe with a little bit of variance for either FX or for the subscriber numbers that Bob referenced?\nTom Staggs: Yes, I think Christine's comments pretty much summarized it. I wouldn't say there's anything unusual. Obviously, the foreign exchange impact is something that we wouldn't expect to see continue year after year, depending on clearly where foreign exchange goes, but other than that -- and also, as Bob's indicated, some of the trends that we see on the subscriber side have shown at least initial signs of abating somewhat and we'll watch those very carefully.\nOperator: From FBR Capital Markets we have Barton Crockett. Please go ahead.\nBarton Crockett: I wanted to ask about the comment earlier that you can have growth in earnings at media networks even with this lower affiliate fee growth trajectory. I was wondering if you could tell us how we get there, given what we know from the step up in sports rights. I know you don't want to guide, but qualitatively, are we looking at cost cutting or are we looking at other revenues coming in to make up the gap for the sports right cost pressure that we see coming up?\nBob Iger: Well, Barton, I think the context that I'd give you on that is, first of all, you've seen how we've successfully grown our advertising revenues. And especially with the branded services and programming that we have, we continue to get a great response from advertisers, both on our linear channels and on new platforms. So that looks good and I think that trend will continue. And I think we've discussed the affiliate side of the equation. The only other thing to keep in mind is that as new sports contracts kick in, next year as an example, that will sometimes cause a shift in terms of how the growth is coming, but the overall growth story is intact. So I think that gives you what color is available there.\nLowell Singer: Barton, thank you for the question. And thanks again, everyone, for joining us today.

My name is Victoria, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the call over to Lowell Singer, Senior VP of Investor Relations. Lowell, you may begin.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Good afternoon, and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast, and a copy of the webcast and a transcript will also be available on our website.

Christine will lead off, followed by Bob and then we'll be happy to take your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to the Christine to get started.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share were $1.07 for the fourth quarter and $5.70 for the full year. Our fiscal 2017 results came in roughly in line with last year, which is consistent with the guidance we provided in early September, although they were adversely affected by three notable items; first, the impact of Hurricane Irma on our Parks business; second, the impact of canceling the animated film Gigantic; and third, the impact at BAMTech of a valuation adjustment to sports programming rights that were prepaid prior to the accusation. In aggregate, these three items reduced fourth quarter and full-year segment operating income by about $275 million or approximately $0.11 in earnings per share. At Parks and Resorts, operating income was up 7% in the quarter, due to an increase at our international operations, partially offset by lower operating income at our domestic operations. The impact of Hurricane Irma, which I'll discuss in more detail in a moment, adversely affected total segment operating income by 14 percentage points. Results at our international operations continued to improve, led by growth at Disneyland Paris and Shanghai Disney Resort. Disneyland Paris benefited from the resort's 25th anniversary celebration and a more favorable tourism environment, which drove higher attendance, guest spending and hotel occupancy. Shanghai Disney's operating income growth was due to higher attendance and, to a lesser extent, lower marketing costs compared to the fourth quarter last year. I'm pleased to note that Shanghai Disney Resort generated positive operating income during its first full fiscal year of operations, which comfortably surpassed our expectations of breakeven from its first year. At our domestic operations, operating income was 6% below prior year due to lower results at Walt Disney World, which were adversely impacted by Hurricane Irma, partially offset by growth at Disney Cruise Line, Disneyland Resort and Disney Vacation Club. Hurricane Irma disrupted our operations in Florida, forcing the closure of Walt Disney World Parks for two days and the cancelation of three Disney Cruise Line itineraries and the shortening of two others. We estimate the aggregate impact of the hurricane was about $100 million in operating income, or about a 16-percentage point adverse impact to year-over-year growth at our domestic operations. Operating margins at our domestic operations were down 170 basis points compared to Q4 last year, and we estimate they were adversely impacted by about 220 basis points due to the hurricane. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 2% in the quarter, reflecting favorable guest response to new attractions, particularly Avatar Flight of Passage at Disney's Animal Kingdom and Guardians of the Galaxy \u2013 Mission: BREAKOUT, at Disney California Adventure and the unfavorable impact of the hurricane on Walt Disney World (4:34). We estimate the hurricane had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in domestic parks' attendance of about 3 percentage points. Per capita spending was comparable to prior year. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 4%, and occupancy was down three percentage points to 84%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing down 1% compared to prior year and reflect reduced room inventory due to conversions and ongoing room refurbishments, while booked rates are up 9%. At Media Networks, lower operating income in the fourth quarter was a result of lower equity income and a decline of Broadcasting, while cable operating income was comparable to prior year. Equity income was lower in the quarter, due to higher losses from our investments in BAMTech and Hulu and lower income at A&E Television Networks. With the closing of our BAMTech acquisition on September 25, BAMTech's results will now be consolidated within our Cable Networks business. At Broadcasting, double-digit growth in affiliate revenue and lower programming expenses were more than offset by lower advertising revenue and a decrease in operating income from program sales. The year-over-year decline in advertising revenue reflects lower impressions at the ABC network, lower political advertising at our owned stations and the absence of the Emmy Awards, partially offset by higher network rates. Quarter-to-date, primetime's scatter pricing at the ABC network is running 34% above upfront levels. As I mentioned earlier, Q4 Cable results were roughly comparable to the prior year. At ESPN, growth in affiliate revenue was offset by higher programming costs and lower advertising revenue. Higher spending on programming was primarily driven by a contractual rate increase for the NFL. Ad revenue at ESPN was down low-single digits in the quarter, as higher rates were more than offset by a decrease in impressions. So far this quarter, ESPN's cash ad sales are pacing down, due in part to the timing of the college football semi-finals and the impact of more game windows on other linear television networks. Like last year, ESPN will air three of the New Year's Six bowl games during the first quarter. However, this year the two semi-final games will air during the second quarter whereas they aired during the first quarter last year. We remain very confident in the value of ESPN's programming, in particular, live must see exclusive events like college football playoffs and in ESPN's ability to reach key audiences that advertisers covet. Total Media Networks' affiliate revenue was up 4% in the quarter, due to growth at both Cable and Broadcasting. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by 7 points of growth due to higher rates, partially offset by about a 3 point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. We completed the renewal of a distribution agreement with Altice, which demonstrates the tremendous value of our networks and positions us well as we head into future negotiations. By the end of 2019, we expect to have new agreements in place covering about 50% of our subscriber base. At the studio, results in the fourth quarter reflect higher film cost impairments, lower operating income from television distribution, driven by the sale of Star Wars classic titles in Q4 last year and lower revenue share from Consumer Products. Operating income in our theatrical and home entertainment businesses was roughly comparable to the prior year. At Consumer Products & Interactive Media, segment operating income was lower in the quarter due to a decrease in our merchandise licensing business. While we saw nice growth in the sale of Cars and Spiderman merchandise during the fourth quarter, the growth was more than offset by strong sales of Star Wars, Frozen and Finding Dory merchandise in Q4 last year. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 33.6 million shares for $3.4 billion and for the full year we repurchased 89.5 million shares for $9.4 billion. So far this quarter, we've repurchased 6.5 million shares for approximately $650 million. With fiscal 2017 now behind us, we are excited for the opportunities that lie ahead for our company, which Bob will discuss momentarily. As we look at fiscal 2018 specifically, our earnings growth will be suppressed somewhat by a couple of factors. First, the consolidation of BAMTech and its ongoing investment in the business will adversely impact cable operating income by about $130 million compared to last year. This will affect our Cable results for the first three quarters of the year with roughly half of this BAMTech related impact expected in Q1. We expect Cable expenses to be up high-single digits for the year driven by the consolidation of BAMTech. However, excluding the impact of BAMTech, we expect underlying Cable expenses to be up low-single digits. Second, we expect our share of losses from our equity investment in Hulu to increase by more than $100 million for the year, driven by Hulu's investment in its digital MVPD service and higher content spending. Given the timing of these investments, we expect about $70 million of that increase in equity losses in the first quarter. At Consumer Products, a timing issue related to the recognition of minimum guarantee shortfall revenue will cause about $60 million in operating income to shift from Q1 into Q2. The timing issue stems from the fact that these contracts are measured at month-end, and our fiscal first quarter ends on December 30 this year, whereas it ended on December 31 last year. And finally, we will continue to invest in our businesses in 2018, particularly at Parks and Resorts where we are building two Star Wars Lands. We expect these investments among others to drive fiscal 2018 consolidated CapEx higher by about $1 billion. We continue to see attractive opportunities to deploy capital in a balanced way, whether it's through investment in our Parks and Resorts business, in support of our direct-to-consumer strategy, or by returning capital to our shareholders. We have the flexibility because of our strong balance sheet. For fiscal 2018, we expect to repurchase $6 billion in stock, which is close to what we've repurchased on average over the past five years. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Christine, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to take you through our priorities in fiscal 2018 to frame up the new year, starting with our direct-to-consumer initiatives. We believe creating a direct-to-consumer relationship is vital to the future of our media businesses, and it's our highest priority this year. Our decision to acquire control of BAMTech enables us to launch robust DTC offerings and immediately provides us the tools we need to stream video at scale, to acquire and retain customers, to greatly enhance our advertising opportunities on digital platforms, and to use consumer data to provide a better user experience while giving us the ability to grow revenue and increase the effectiveness of our digital marketing efforts. Our first DTC product will be our ESPN-branded sports service, which will be called ESPN+. Launching in the spring, the product will be accessible through a new and fully redesigned EPSN app, which will allow users to access sports scores and highlights, stream our channels on an authenticated basis and subscribe to ESPN+ for additional sports coverage, including thousands of live sporting events. This one app experience will be a one of a kind product, offering sports fans far more than they can get on any other app, website, or channel and immediately propelling ESPN in the new direction. We will demonstrate this app in early 2018 and also detail pricing and other elements to provide some perspective on the potential this represents to our company. Additionally, we're leveraging BAMTech to launch a Disney-branded DTC service in the latter part of 2019, streaming the latest Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars feature films in the first pay window. Our studio will also produce four or five future films a year exclusively for this service. We're also planning to produce a number of original series for the new service, and we're already developing a Star Wars live action series, a series based on our popular Pixar Monsters franchise, a High School Musical series and a series for Marvel television along with a rich array of other content including new movies from our Disney Channel creative team as well as a variety of short form films and features from across our company. The service will also offer thousands of hours of Disney film and TV library product. In the coming months we'll share specifics about content development, launch plans and investment levels. Our strategic acquisitions have been a key driver of the historic achievements and performance we've achieved over the last decade. We believe BAMTech is another game changing acquisition, and we're confident in our ability to generate maximum value from it. The acquisition of Marvel helped drive our studio's performance since 2009. The movies we release in the Marvel cinematic universe to-date have delivered an average global box office of more than $840 million each. We have four new Marvel movies in fiscal 2018, starting with Thor: Ragnarok, which has already topped $500 million in worldwide box office since it premiered two weeks ago. To put this early performance into perspective, the box office total for the entire run of our first Thor movie in 2011 was $449 million. Thor: Ragnarok is also one of the best reviewed Marvel movies to-date. We're very excited about Marvel's next great movie, Black Panther, which opens next February, and we're bringing The Avengers back in May with the release of Infinity War. Our final Marvel movie of the year, Ant-Man and the Wasp, will be in theaters next July. As you know our acquisition of Pixar effectively revitalized our entire animation business, which is essential to the health of our company. Since that acquisition, the average global box office for our animated movies has risen to more than $665 million, and we've captured nine of the 10 Oscars awarded for feature animation. We'll release two new movies from Pixar in fiscal 2018. We're thrilled with the early reaction to Coco, which opens at Thanksgiving and we're also looking forward to the summer release of the Incredibles 2. We have big ambitions for the Star Wars franchise when we acquired Lucasfilm five years ago and are already exceeding our expectations. The Force Awakens and Rogue One alone delivered more than $3 billion at the box office revealing the tremendous and enduring appeal of this franchise and establishing a strong foundation for the future. We're thrilled to have two new Star Wars movies in theaters during this fiscal year. The Last Jedi opens December 15. Ticket presales are strong and the excitement will only intensify as we get closer to the release date. And we just wrapped production on Solo, our second standalone Star Wars movie, essentially a Han Solo origin story and given the huge popularity and global affection for this iconic character, we expect a lot of interest and enthusiasm when it opens over Memorial Day weekend. We've got more great Star Wars movies already planned for years to come in addition to the 2019 release of Episode Nine, we're very happy to announce that we just closed a deal with Rian Johnson, the director of The Last Jedi, to develop a brand new Star Wars trilogy. We continue to make significant investments required to drive long-term growth across our entire company. In our Parks and Resorts for example, we've commissioned three spectacular new cruise ships, which will all be completed between 2021 and 2023. We're nearing completion on Toy Story Lands in Shanghai and Orlando, both of which will open by next summer. And major construction continues on our Star Wars Lands in Disneyland and Walt Disney World, which are on schedule to open in 2019. We're also adding new attractions in hotels and our resorts around the world along with cutting-edge technology to enhance the guest experience. We remain optimistic about our future in part because quality truly does matter and the quality of our content, our products and our services set Disney apart. No other company in entertainment today is better equipped to meet the challenges of the changing world or better positioned for continued growth thanks to our collection of brands, our strong franchises and our unique ability to leverage IP across our entire company to maximize value and create new opportunities. We'll continue to invest for the future and take the smart risks required to keep moving forward. I'm now happy to turn the call over to Lowell and then Christine and I will be happy to take your questions. Lowell?\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay. Bob. Thanks. Everyone, just so you know, we have been having some slight technical issues on the call, I think with our host. So we have switched phones and if for some reason we get disconnected during the call we will dial back in. So with that, we are happy to take the first question.\nOperator: Our first question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Thank you. I have just one for Bob and it's a two-parter. One is, because you didn't say \u2013 we're not going to talk about press speculation, you have a chance to actually address the stories this week in press. If you don't want to do that...\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Michael, let me jump in. It's Lowell. I have some bad news and good news. The bad news is, as is our practice we are not going to take any questions on press speculation. But the good news is we'll give you another question.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Thank you, Lowell. It's very kind of you. So Bob, I figured...\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Lowell should not say that.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Okay.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Go ahead.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: So what's in your presentation a minute ago, you walked through your film strategy and that was essentially fixing Disney's film content. So this week, Kevin Mayer there was saying that Disney's turned their attention to looking at TV because that's where the challenges are. So I wonder, when you think about television, do you see the television challenge for you guys as having the right platform, the right model, or having the right content? So is there a content fix here that maybe needs to be done as you did in film?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Well, we think that the world today offers ample opportunity to monetize high quality, call it, in-demand television programming. I think that's been demonstrated by a number of entities out there today. And if you look at consumption, which admittedly is fragmented, it's actually quite significant in terms of people's interest in consuming TV. We've had over the last few years, we've had some disappointments on the ABC side, but we've been focused on turning that around. We're actually very pleased with the performance of The Good Doctor already and we have three dramas in mid-season that we're quite excite excited about as well including a Grey's Anatomy spinoff. So I think as we look at TV, we think yes some improvement would, from a quality perspective, would be helpful. But we also think we've got great opportunities. We also have strong production and creative capabilities both from the ABC production side, but also from the Disney television production side and from Marvel. And I mentioned in my earlier comments that we're in development on the Star Wars live action series as well. So our intention as a company is to take advantage of the opportunities that exist out there today for good television and to produce more of it.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Okay. Thanks.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay, Michael, thanks. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you. I've got one for Bob, one for Christine if I may. Bob, I guess when you look at your film studio, specifically you've really outperformed at such a huge margin and the pipeline continues to look so robust. I guess, can more scale or acquisitions facilitate further growth? Or does it \u2013 is your plate really full enough given the successful studios and IP (23:03) you already have?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: I appreciate the question. I think it's leading the witness a little bit as it relates to the subject that Michael brought up earlier. There's \u2013 I don't think that there's ever such a thing as having too much quality or too many strong franchises when it comes to films. We do not feel right now that we have a great need to add to the film slate that we have because as you cited we're doing just fine. It doesn't mean there isn't room for more, we just don't have a significant or urgent need for that. That said, we also as a company demonstrated an ability to leverage success in this area not just in our studio but across various other businesses, particularly Consumer Products and theme parks. And so we're always going be looking to adding to the number of film franchises that we produce and own.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you. And then, Christine, I know it might be too early days, but I was wondering if there's any color you can provide on the investment spending associated with the 2019 direct-to-consumer launch. Any sort of early data you can give us in a way to frame how we should think about potential earnings adjustment going into that product launch.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Alexia, we have not yet finalized what the content spend is going to be and the cadence of it. But as Bob mentioned, we will be providing more information on that as it develops over the next few months.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Alexia, thank you. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Bob, now that you've got the Altice deal done so your first renewal this cycle sort of behind you and at least for this quarter, the subscriber losses seem to have gotten less severe. How are you feeling about that business over the next couple of years? Is that a business that you think operating income should grow? Do you have that sort of confidence? I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the outlook for that business and how the OTT launch fits into it. And then, Christine, if I could just follow up on Alexia's question on the either foregone licensing or incremental programming, are we able to say at least for fiscal 2018 that we won't have a material impact from those two factors hitting earnings, since you didn't list them when you talked in your prepared remarks about sort of factors to be thinking about this year.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Ben, I won't say too much about the Altice deal. I know you asked about the business overall, but I will say that in that deal, we met or achieved both our pricing and our distribution objectives, which bodes very well for negotiations that we will be having in 2019 and beyond, actually 2018 and beyond rather, Verizon in 2018 and Charter and AT&T Direct beyond that and then Comcast beyond that. We're pleased with where we ended up. We're also pleased with trends that we're seeing on the OTT side where we've seen a nice pick-up in subs in the, basically, the new players in the market. And what we're really heartened by is the fact that some of them are spending a fair amount and have stepped up their marketing efforts aggressively. If you watched the World Series, you probably couldn't have missed the number of spots that were in almost every hour for I guess it was YouTube, new OTT service. That we think is great. It's also interesting that these OTT, the entrants in the OTT business are spending in live sports. They obviously believe that the sports fan is potentially a primary customer of new OTT services, and what we've seen as well is millennials seem to be particularly interested in these services. I think it's a combination of pricing and the user-friendly nature of these services. As we've said call after call, we've had some sub issues that we've been dealing with, but Christine's comment suggested that while we lost some subs in the quarter, the losses were not as deep as they have been in prior quarters. And we're not \u2013 we're heartened by that as well. But it is one quarter. The other thing I want to note that's interesting, this ties into your question about the health of the business, is that Nielsen provided us with two weeks of data, which was essentially data about live consumption of sports across multiple platforms, including streaming and these OTT services. And what they told us was that by including that we had a 25% increase in total day ratings and a 29% increase among \u2013 in primetime. That was basically, that includes out-of-home viewing as well. So we think that the trends that we're seeing, albeit they're still not lengthy trends, but are at least giving us some reason to feel good about the business. We've always felt we were positioned well in it because of ESPN and Disney and ABC. And on the direct-to-consumer front, as we've said as well, that we're going into that business because we believe that our direct-to-consumer opportunities, given the technology that's out there, are significant and given the fact that we've got these great brands and franchises. And we think that what we're doing can easily be complementary to the multichannel services in the market, both the traditional ones and the new ones. And when you see the apps that we will demonstrate sometime after the first of the year, you'll see that we're coming up \u2013 we're developing one app experiences where ESPN's app will enable the highlights and scores that ESPN typically gives, will enable live streaming of the channels on an authenticated basis. And will also add a Plus service, which will enable users to subscribe to for an extra fee to thousands more live sporting events a year.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Ben, to answer your question on the 2018 spend, in my comments I mentioned the BAMTech investment that was going to impact Cable operating income by $130 million. That's BAMTech, but on the Disney D2C, we don't expect any significant items to impact spend in 2018.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's helpful. Thank you, both.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Maybe switching just a little bit, but just a little bit about addressable or targeted advertising. Is it still off-limits on the Disney DTC offer? And how do you think about the tipping point on addressability across all Disney advertising-related platforms? And then just, Christine, if we could just follow up on some of the CapEx questions, can you talk about the cadence at all beyond fiscal 2018? It was great to get the color for fiscal 2018, but given the number of projects, Toy Story lands, Star Wars lands, the cruise ships, Shanghai, can you just talk about like fiscal \u2013 beyond fiscal 2018, fiscal 2019 through 2022 or 2023, what the cadence might be?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Jessica, on the first question, we're going launch ESPN service in the spring. That obviously will be advertiser supported. BAMTech, as we said at your conference, and as I said in my remarks earlier, offers us some \u2013 far more, I should say, capabilities when it relates to, as it relates to addressable ads live \u2013 inserted live on a dynamic basis into live sporting events. And so we feel that that gives us a lot of capability that we haven't had before. Whether that extends, that capability extends to our other businesses in the non-direct to consumer, I'm not sure. We're currently not planning to sell ads on the Disney service, but that's just in development. There may be some interesting possibilities in terms of sponsorships versus inserted ads. But as of now, we're not planning to have the programming that airs in the OTT \u2013 sorry, the DTC service interrupted by commercials.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Jessica, on CapEx, you see for this year that we gave the comment that you can expect CapEx for 2018 to be about $1 billion above the 2017 level. And once again, a lot of that spend is going into the completion of the two Star Wars Lands and we're also completing Toy Story Land in Orlando and there's other initiatives that are in process around the globe. We've talked about the longer-term menu and I think at some of the meetings we've had, we've talked about the longer-term plans for our Parks and Resort business and developing out further on attractions and resorts. So I think it's fair to assume that we will continue to make investments in areas in which we see driving long-term value and long-term returns. So I would say this is a business that we feel very confident in and the business is working right now at a very high level and will continue to do so.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: The other thing to add to that is when you look at the results of our international parks, Shanghai, as Christine cited, and the improvements we're seeing in Paris and the restructuring in Paris as well as Hong Kong and even Tokyo, we have ample opportunity to continue to invest and continue to expand those businesses. And with the franchises that we have and their popularity in these markets, the opportunity actually has increased significantly over the last few years.\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thank you, Jessica. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nJason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Just a question for Mr. Iger. Not really talking numbers but more philosophically, as you approach Disney DTC, have you decided sort of the cadence that you're going to approach this opportunity? In other words, you could go and sort of spend large and sort of say there's only going be one or two winners on the back end of this evolution and Disney's going be one of them. And the other way you could do it is just sort of spend consistent with the revenue that that new business generates. So it doesn't really contribute to earnings maybe over the next three to five years. Can you just describe how you're thinking about the cadence of your approach?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Sure. Before I do that, because there's been a lot written about whether this is aimed at being a Netflix killer, et cetera, and so on. By the way, they've been a good partner of ours. Our goal here is be a viable player in the direct-to-consumer space, space that we all know is a very, very compelling space to be in. We also believe that our brands and our franchises really matter, as we've seen through Netflix and all other platforms. And so that gives us an opportunity as well. We are working on the cadence that we will produce in sort of scheduled product in this OTT service. We've not determined fully what that will be, although we've laid out on a calendar basis a fair amount of specifics. We're still working to develop original movies and original TV shows and figure out what makes the most sense. Part of it has to do with when they will be available. But I'd say that we're \u2013 I don't want to say we're going to walk before we run because we're going to \u2013 as I've said earlier, we're going launch this thing pretty aggressively. But I think what you'll see is a ramp-up over time of production spending that will start with a product that we believe is representative of the great brands and franchises that we have between Marvell and Disney and Pixar and Star Wars and then grow from there.\nJason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thank you, Jason. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nTodd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks. I can't help but ask my respective question on the entertainment OTT. I'm sorry. And then I have a quick one on Consumer Products as well. Actually, just picking up kind of right where you left off, Bob. I'm just very curious to know how you're thinking about the role of the Disney brand. Obviously, very important to the service and what that means in terms of the type of content you envision ultimately fits within that brand on the service. You've talked about a lot of Disney branded content specifically. And I heard you list obviously Marvel and Lucasfilm and Pixar. It begs the question, do you think about Freeform and ABC content is also fitting within Disney? And then even when you start thinking of content that you could license in or otherwise get a hold of outside of your company, can you imagine that fitting in the service? Or does this need to stay narrowly defined sort of as all about the Disney brand and what that means? Thanks. And then, quickly, just on Consumer Products just \u2013 we had \u2013 I just wonder how you think the Cars \u2013 Cars has been the stalwart of Consumer Products for so long. You've had a new release of a movie. Just wondered how the results lived up to your expectations on the Consumer Products side of that. And depending on your answer to that, any warnings or if you think about other franchises, particularly animation space, it lasted a long time in the new world of the consumer opportunity there. Just any warnings from that would be great. Thanks.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay. Todd, so this service will be Disney branded. In other words, it will be Disney named. We haven't determined what the name is yet, but it will be Disney named. The product we have in Europe is called DisneyLife, but we've not decided what this one will be yet. I think you have to think about it like you think about our theme parks, where they are Disney parks, but you go in and you see Marvel and Star Wars and Pixar for instance. So it's a collection \u2013 it will be a collection of just those brands. And if one of those series, whether it's from Marvel or Lucas, whatever has standards versus \u2013 nothing's going be hard \u2013 nothing's going to be our, but there are standards that don't necessarily fit completely with, I'll call it, the G or the G-rated Disney. There will be ample filtering opportunities for people using it, so if you just wanted your kids to see the Disney-only product that can easily be accomplished. We're not ruling out the possibility of licensing product from third parties for it provided the product fits with the Disney brand. As it relates to ABC and Freeform, we're going to continue to produce product for ABC and Freeform and our production capabilities for programming like that, we'll also look to sell product to third parties including Hulu. And it's also possible by the way that ABC productions could end up producing for the Disney-branded service as well. We've actually talked about that a bit. But we're going stick to Disney branded service and it will include Marvel, Pixar and Lucas brands within it, or Star Wars brands.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: So, Todd, on your question on Consumer Products specifically related to Cars. Cars is still a very strong franchise for us. So even though Cars 3, the theatrical release of the movie underperformed and the performance of Consumer Products in this calendar year was a little bit lighter than we would have liked it to be, it's still one of our strongest franchises. And when we talk about some of the franchises that are over $1 billion annually, Cars is in there. And just another thing about 2018, for Consumer Products, we feel really, really good about the lineup we have going into this year. We have Star Wars Episode 8: The Last Jedi. We deferred revenue in the fourth quarter into the first quarter like we did with Episode 7 for that. We also have a Han Solo movie coming out named Solo in the spring quarters. And we've got four Marvel movies including Avengers in the spring. We also have Mickey's 90 birthday. You should mark your calendar for this. It's November 18 of 2018. But Mickey's 90th is something that the entire company's going to get behind and that should also be good for our Consumer Products business.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Todd, thank you. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Cahall from RBC. Please go ahead.\nSteven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Two for me. First, Bob, on direct-to-consumer, I was wondering if you have given thought to the pricing strategy. Netflix has certainly been rewarded for strong subscriber growth rather than necessarily revenue growth. So do you think you build more equity value by coming out with a product that's really inexpensive in the Disney-branded direct-to-consumer in order to maximize sub growth early on? And then, Christine, just on the buyback guidance, I think you did a little less than $9 billion in free cash flow this year. And you've got $1 billion step up in CapEx, so that's $8 billion in free cash flow before any cash flow growth next year at the operating line, so why the big step down in the buyback year-on-year? Are you just trying to be conservative and give yourself some wiggle room as you go through the year? Is it a view to the share price? Is it a view to build cash on the balance sheet? Any color there would be great. Thank you.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Steven, we've given a lot of thought to pricing both the ESPN and the Disney-branded service, and I can't get specific with you yet. We haven't actually officially determined it, but we said we will be forthcoming with you on this sometime after the first of the year. I can say that our plan on the Disney side is to price this substantially below where Netflix is. That is in part reflective of the fact that it will have substantially less volume. It'll have a lot of high quality because of the brands and the franchises that will be on it that we've talked about. But it'll simply launch with less volume, and the price will reflect that. It is our goal to attract as many subs as possible as starting out. We think we've got some interesting opportunities there given the affinity to Disney, whether it's with our Disney-branded credit cardholders, our annual pass holders, people who are members of D23, people who own Vacation Club units at Disney, people who visit our parks frequently. There's a gigantic potential Disney customer base out there that we're going to seek to attract with pricing that is commensurate with or that balances the quality of the brands and franchises that are in there, but also takes into account the volume. And that will give us an opportunity to grow in volume and to have the pricing over time reflect the added volume as this product ages.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Steve, on the buyback, that $6 billion is a number that as I mentioned is the average over the last five years, roughly the average over the last five years. As you saw both in 2017 and 2016, we came in at a higher level than what we originally started out the year at. So if you want to view that as a conservative approach, we are early in the year, and we'll make adjustments as we go through the year based on the business environment. But once again, we have increased the last couple of years from what we originally started out at.\nSteven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Marci? Okay, operator let's move on. Oh, there you are. Now we got you, Marci.\nMarci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Just a little more color on the sports write offs if that's what they were related to BAMTech. Was it a certain sport? Was this just technical just because there's so much sensitivity around sports rights right now? And then second question there was an article that came out at some point talking about maybe there's a time when ESPN may not participate or have NFL rates and maybe you are changing your distribution agreements to allow some sort of flexibility. Is there any...\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay. We lost you Marci, is that (44:59)\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: We lost you.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: The line is open the operator said.\nMarci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Can you hear me?\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: We lost you but...\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: So we got the two questions, so NFL \u2013 the NFL was one, which we're not going to comment on. We've had a long, healthy relationship with the NFL. It's important product to ESPN, both the live games that we have on Monday night and all the shoulder programming that we do, some of it or much of it licensed directly from the NFL. And we're not going to comment on anything related to the future relationship or as it affects our distribution agreements.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: So, on the BAMTech valuation adjustment, that was an adjustment to programming rights that were prepaid prior to the acquisition. And we're not going be specific on it, but it does relate just to one rights deal. And we looked at it based on current performance and the duration of the contract and we didn't think we had enough time to recover the payment so the contract was mark-to-market.\nMarci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay, Marci. Thanks. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Nollen from Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nTim Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Bob, I'd like to follow up on your comments on the really strong pickup in ratings from the streaming viewership. I know there's a summit being convened later this month by one of your peers. I just wonder if you have comments to make on broader use of digital measurement in the TV ecosystem.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Well, I think, first of all, as I said earlier, it just was two weeks. And we like the trend, obviously, we have to give this more time. Frankly, we're not really surprised by it though because we've known for long time that out-of-home viewing of sports is significant. And the more granular or the more unimpeachable data we get on that the better because it just confirms what we all know. We all watch sports, whoever we are, all out of the home. It also confirms that sports on mobile platforms, which often is out of the home, is also growing in popularity. And this picks up a lot of that consumption. And the other thing it includes, it includes live sports viewership on new OTT entrants, on new OTT platforms. And there too, in part because of the interest in those platforms from millennials suggests that sports, live sports is very, very important to those platforms. And I think that's reflected in the fact every one of these services that launched has launched with the rights to distribute ESPN and to all of their customers because they know how vital it is. And as I said earlier, just the fact that these platforms are advertising in live sports suggests they're going after the sports viewer or the sports fan because they think that is high potential for them as a customer. So we feel good about what we're seeing. And while there's obviously been a lot of attention paid to ESPN and subs, et cetera, and so on, we've never lost our bullishness about ESPN. The brand is strong. The quality of their programming is strong. There are always opportunities to improve. We're just launching a new morning program, as a for instance. But we like where ESPN is these days and we believe that one of the best things that we've got going for ESPN is the new technology in the marketplace that's enabling people to watch sports on more user-friendly platforms and wherever they are. And if we can measure that and add to that the technology that we need to monetize advertising in more effective ways, that's a pretty good combination.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Tim, thank you. Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Barton Crockett from B. Riley. Please go ahead.\nBarton Crockett - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for taking the question. I was interested in looking at the bigger kind of impact of Hulu. So you've got some drag from your share of the losses in the earnings of Hulu, but you've also got a benefit from you were selling them programming to some degree. You're getting subs from them that pay you fees or some share of advertising. I was just wondering when you net it all together is this actually a net drag or largely mitigated or maybe a net positive if you look at the broader impact of Hulu?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Talking over time or to date because we know to date...\nBarton Crockett - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: To-date, obviously over time you think it works, but just right now as you're kind of ramping up I think there's some mitigation of the expenses there with some of the benefits.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: So, to date, the P&L impact of Hulu is positive to the company...\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: For the year.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Sorry, for the year. For fiscal 2017.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Right.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Is positive to the company because the investment that we made in it as it grows has been offset by the licensing fees that we've gotten for both our channels, but largely in 2017, because they didn't launch the service until late then the licensing of programming to the standard Hulu service. And it was also an improvement from 2016. So in other words, we had growth to the bottom line in Hulu from 2016 to 2017. Where our continued investment in Hulu is because we're confident in its ability to both grow in terms of its SVOD service, but also to grow as an OTT multichannel operator. And we've seen some nice numbers there. Still just the beginning and we're not going to get specific about what those are, but we got new management in Hulu as well. Randy Freer is now running it, and I know he's certainly bullish about it. And we continue to believe that long term Hulu is a significant \u2013 will be a significantly valuable investment for us. We also believe that we can grow our licensing to Hulu, talked earlier about television production, yet another opportunity for us.\nBarton Crockett - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Okay. That's fine. Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thank you, Barton. And thanks, everyone for joining us today. Sorry about some of the technical glitches.

My name is Karen, I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Lowell, you may begin.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Good afternoon, and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. About 25 minutes ago, we issued two press releases, both our earnings release and a press release announcing our acquisition of majority ownership of BAMTech, and two upcoming direct-to-consumer streaming services. Both of those releases are available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast, and a recording and transcript will also be available on our website. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob will lead off, followed by Christine, and then, of course, we'll be happy to take your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob, and we'll get started.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. Besides today's earnings release, which Christine, will detail after my remarks, we're also announcing a major strategic shift in the way we distribute our content. We're excited by this change and see it as an important logical way for us to take advantage of the combination of our strong brands with the technological evolution the entire media business is undergoing. It's been clear to us for a while with the future of this industry will be forged by direct relationships between content creators and consumers. Given our incomparable collection of strong brands that are recognized and respected the world over, no one is better positioned to lead the industry into this dynamic new era, and we're accelerating our strategy to be at the forefront of this transformation. Last year, we acquired a substantial stake in BAMTech to help us scale and monetize our streaming capabilities. Since then, we've been increasingly impressed with the platform, the leadership, and the potential to drive growth. So much so that we're investing an additional $1.6 billion to increase our stake from 33% to 75% and acquire control of the company. This move gives us immediate access to the team and the technology we need to deliver the highest quality direct-to-consumer experience, which ultimately gives us much greater control of our own destiny in a rapidly changing market. As a direct result of this acquisition, we are greatly expanding our plans for the first ESPN-branded direct-to-consumer service. We're creating a more robust multi-sport package, which will give sports fans access to more live sports, 10,000 additional events annually including Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, Major League Soccer, Grand Slam Tennis, and college sports. Additionally, we'll make individual sports packages available for purchase, including MLB.TV, NHL.TV and MLS Live. Subscribers will access the new service through an enhanced version of the current ESPN app, which millions of fans already use for sports news and programming. We'll fully integrate the new subscription service into the same app as part of our strategy to create the premier digital destination for sports. Consumers, who are pay-TV subscribers, will also be able to access the ESPN television networks in the same app on an authenticated basis. Ultimately, we envision this will become a dynamic sports marketplace that will grow and be increasingly customizable, allowing sports fans to pick and choose content that reflects their personal interests. Our new direct ESPN service will be available to consumers in early 2018. Of course, one of the most compelling brands for a direct-to-consumer product is Disney, and to that end, we will launch a Disney-branded streaming service in 2019, which will be unlike anything else in the market. The new service will become the exclusive home in the U.S. for subscription video-on-demand viewing of the newest live action and animated movies from Disney and Pixar, beginning with the 2019 slate, which includes Toy Story 4, the sequel to Frozen, and The Lion King from Disney live-action, along with other highly-anticipated movies. We'll also be making a substantial investment in original movies, original television series, and short form content for this platform, produced by our studio, Disney Interactive and Disney Channel teams. Subscribers will also have access to a vast collection of films and television content from our library. With this strategic shift, we'll end our distribution agreement with Netflix for subscription streaming of new releases beginning with the 2019 calendar-year theatrical slate. These announcements marked the beginning of what will be an entirely new growth strategy for the company, one that takes advantage of the opportunities the changing media and technology industries provide us to leverage the strength of our great brands. Turning to another major growth area for us, today's results reflect our aggressive investment in our Parks and Resorts business. Given the success of these investments and their continued attractive returns, we're continuing to leverage our great intellectual property and numerous investments across our Parks and Resorts businesses. Over the last decade, we've transformed Disney California Adventure, doubled the size of our Cruise fleet, brought the phenomenal world of Pandora to life in Orlando, and opened the spectacular Shanghai Disney Resort, which has already welcomed more than 13 million guests. Looking ahead, we'll open Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge in Disneyland and Disney World in 2019, and we just announced an immersive Star Wars-themed hotel in Orlando as well. The most popular attraction in Shanghai Disneyland is our E-ticket TRON Lightcycle experience, and we're bringing the same attraction to Disney World as part of our ongoing expansion there. We're also transforming Epcot with new attractions based on Ratatouille and Guardians of the Galaxy. We're making some important investments in Disneyland Paris, including transforming the existing Hotel New York into our first Marvel-themed hotel, and we're adding three incredible new ships to the award-winning Disney Cruise fleet, all of which will be completed by 2023. Before I turn the call over to Christine, I want to mention some of the movies we're looking forward to from our studio. We've got four movies from Marvel in the next fiscal year alone, Thor: Ragnarok, Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War, and Ant-Man and the Wasp. The full Marvel development activity extends well into the next decade. We've got a lot of fantastic animation on the way starting with Pixar's Coco and The Incredibles 2. Additionally, highly-anticipated sequels to Frozen, Wreck-It Ralph, and Toy Story are in production. We're also looking forward to A Wrinkle in Time from Disney Live-Action as well as live-action versions of Mulan, Dumbo, and The Lion King. And coming soon from a galaxy far, far away, Star Wars: The Last Jedi will be in theaters this December, followed by a Han Solo origin story next year, and Episode 9 in 2019. The studio slate is the strongest we've ever had, reflecting the valuable intellectual property we acquired in the last decade, and the array of talent at our Studio business. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Christine, to talk about our quarter, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Christine?\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Earnings per share for the third quarter, excluding certain items affecting comparability, were $1.58, down 2% compared to last year. As I mentioned during last quarter's earnings call, we expected a number of factors to adversely impact our third-quarter results, the largest of which was higher programming expenses at ESPN due to the first year of the new NBA contract. I'll discuss the impact of these factors in greater detail as I go through the individual segment results. Let's start with Parks and Resorts, where operating income was up 18% in the third quarter, driven by growth in our International operations. Results at our Domestic operations were comparable to Q3 last year. Third-quarter segment results benefited from the timing of the Easter holiday, which fell entirely in Q3 this year, compared to Q2 last year. We estimate the timing of Easter drove an $80 million benefit to operating income, and accounted for about 8 percentage points of the 18% growth in segment operating income. The growth in our International operations was due primarily to the absence of pre-opening expenses at Shanghai Disney Resort and improved results at Disneyland Paris. As Bob mentioned, we feel very good about how Shanghai Disney Resort has performed during its first full-year of operations, and we expect the resort to be modestly profitable for the fiscal year. At Disneyland Paris; the resort's 25th Anniversary celebration helped drive growth in guest spending and attendance. Late in the third quarter, we increased our ownership in Disneyland Paris to 100%. We are encouraged by the resort's third-quarter results, and, as Bob mentioned, we are making investments to drive future growth. In our Domestic business, higher guest spending and attendance drove 6% revenue growth. But the increase in revenue was offset by higher expenses to support higher volume and new attractions, including Pandora \u2013 The World of Avatar at Animal Kingdom, and Guardians of the Galaxy \u2013 Mission: BREAKOUT!, at Disney California Adventure, as well as costs associated with an 18-day dry-dock of the Disney Fantasy. Attendance at our Domestic parks was up 8% in the quarter, benefiting from the timing of the Easter holiday, which accounted for about 3 percentage points of that growth. Per capita spending in our Domestic parks was up 2%. At our Domestic hotels, per-room spending was up 8%, while occupancy was down 2 percentage points to 88%. If you adjust for rooms not available due to refurbishments, occupancy would be comparable to prior year. So far this quarter, Domestic resort reservations are pacing down 3% versus prior year, driven by reduced room inventory due to conversions and ongoing room refurbishments, while booked rates are up 6%. Segment operating margin was about 24% for the third quarter, up 120 basis points over Q3 last year. We estimate the favorable timing of Easter accounted for approximately 120 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. At Studio Entertainment, operating income was lower in the quarter as growth in television distribution was more than offset by lower theatrical and home entertainment results. While our studio is having another phenomenal year with over $2.1 billion in operating income year-to-date, I'll remind you, last year, the studio delivered record profitability. The decline in theatrical distribution during the third quarter reflects the performance of key titles in Q3 last year, including Captain America: Civil War, The Jungle Book, Finding Dory, and Alice Through the Looking Glass, compared to Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, and Cars 3 in Q3 this year. Home entertainment results also faced a difficult comparison as they reflected the phenomenal sales of Star Wars: The Force Awakens in the quarter last year, compared to very strong sales of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story this year. At Media Networks, our Cable and Broadcasting businesses generated lower operating income in the third quarter, compared to last year. Cable results were driven by a decrease at ESPN where higher programming expense and lower advertising revenue more than offset growth in affiliate revenue. As we've discussed, ESPN is in the first year of its new NBA contract and about $400 million of the $600 million year-one cost step-up was incurred in Q3. Total Cable expense growth for the third quarter came in at 14%, about 2 percentage points better than the 16% we discussed on our last call. Ad revenue at ESPN was down 8% in the third quarter as higher rates were more than offset by a decrease in impressions. During the third quarter, ESPN had two fewer NBA finals games and three fewer conference playoff games compared to last year. We estimate this impact was roughly equivalent to the decline in ad revenue, compared to the prior year. So far this quarter, ESPN cash ad sales are pacing down, compared to prior year. Turning to Broadcasting, third quarter operating income reflected lower advertising revenue and higher programming costs, partially offset by higher affiliate revenue. Ad revenue at the ABC network was down 5% for the third quarter, as higher pricing was more than offset by a decrease in impressions. Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC network is running 11% above upfront levels. We continued to see nice growth in Broadcasting affiliate revenue, driven primarily by higher rates. Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 2% in the quarter due to growth at both Cable and Broadcasting. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by about 7 points of growth due to higher rates, partially offset by approximately a 3.5 point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. I'll note that year-to-date, the impact of sub losses on the growth in affiliate revenue is less than 3 percentage points. At Consumer Products and Interactive Media, operating income was up 12% in the third quarter due primarily to an increase in our merchandise licensing business, which was driven by lower costs in the quarter, compared to last year. Operating income growth came in a little lower than we had planned, and while we still anticipate OI growth the second half of the fiscal year, we don't expect these results to be sufficient to drive growth at Consumer Products and Interactive Media for the full year. During the third quarter, we repurchased 22.3 million shares for $2.4 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, we've repurchased 64.3 million shares for approximately $6.8 billion, and we are on track to repurchase between $9 billion to $10 billion for the full year. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Lowell for Q&A.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: All right, Christine. Thanks. Operator, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And we do have our first question from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. A lot of news today. I guess, Bob, to start out with, can you talk a little bit about the ESPN over-the-top service, and whether you've had any discussions with your MVPD providers in how this may fit or not fit into their retail offerings? And along those lines, as you head into a renewal cycle, obviously there's a lot of focus on your pricing power. Does this offer change your perspective on pricing power for the network? You've shifted away from your historical distribution model a bit here, but obviously a lot of media companies have already gone through this process, HBO, CBS, et cetera. So how are you thinking about the relationship between your core distributors and this new ESPN service that you're bringing to market?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: We've not had conversations with our distributors. As we enter a new round of distribution negotiations, we have all the confidence in the world and our ability to strike deals that are favorable to the company, given the strength of the product that we offer, particularly the strength of the brands. If you look very specifically at ESPN, we still see it as a must-have service for the multichannel providers because of the array of product that ESPN has licensed, and what they produce is original programming for the service. We have seen, as I think that many of you have, a pretty interesting and dramatic increase in, I'll call it, app-based media consumption. Much of it is on over-the-top direct-to-consumer services. And in our 33% investment in BAM a year ago, we got a real good perspective \u2013 or gained a good perspective on just how strong and high quality that product is and felt that, given the trends we're seeing in the marketplace, given the strength of the ESPN brand, and given how robust this platform is, it gave us an opportunity to really take advantage of all of this, the combination of all these things. And so we accelerated our right to buy control of the service, basically so that we can have even more control of our own destiny, but it's also something that the partners of BAMTech, notably Major League Baseball and National Hockey League concurred with. And so this gives us the ability to launch a new service, one that we've been talking about, but it will be even more robust than the one we anticipated. In the first year of operation, it should offer consumers approximately 10,000 additional live sporting events over what ESPN offers on its linear networks. This is a combination of the contribution of the partners, as well as what BAMTech has licensed, as well as what ESPN will provide and has also licensed to BAMTech. We're creating a one-app experience so that from a consumer perspective there's a real ease-of-use and ease-of-navigation, so that you can as an ESPN fan, you can use \u2013 go to one app, look at scores and highlights as you know the ESPN provides, authenticate it to watch the linear networks or buy up or buy an additional amount of live sports programming basically in the same experience on the same service. That's essentially it. It does give us optionality in the future. If we see changes in the distribution model, if we see either greater erosion or bigger opportunity to migrate the linear networks to a more direct-to-consumer proposition, we certainly have the technology to do it, and it can be done under relatively seamless circumstances. But we're not currently anticipating doing that as we launch this new app.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's very helpful. And just on the Disney-branded direct-to-consumer service, Bob, as you, I'm sure, are well aware one of the beauties of Netflix model is its global, and so you're talking about a massive footprint to leverage your content. Are you thinking the same way about the Disney-branded service? You mentioned the change in your pay-TV, Pay 1 rights with Netflix in the U.S., but how are you thinking about the global opportunity? And what you need to do on the content site globally?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Well, one of the beauties of the Disney brand is just how global it is and how strong the fan base of Disney is globally. Interestingly enough, Netflix did not have global rights to our Disney movies. They bought opportunistically in certain markets. So what we see doing on the Disney front is we will take our Disney-branded, Pixar-branded movies that had been part of the Netflix paying agreement starting with the calendar 2019 slate \u2013 by the way, that will include Lion King, Frozen 2, and Toy Story, among others. We'll migrate those, in effect pay window Disney Pixar movies, to a subscription Disney-branded service. We'll also tap into a vast library of movies and television shows that have been made by the company, the Channel and the Studio over the years, and we'll invest significantly in original movies and television shows exclusively for this subscription service. We'll also rollout the service in multiple markets outside the United States, but it will vary from market to market based on existing distribution agreements and different market dynamics. But I think you have to think about a Disney branded direct-to-consumer subscription service as a global product, even though we are being more specific today about launching a domestic product in the latter part of 2019.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: It's very helpful. Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Ben, thanks for the questions. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Thanks. Bob, I have two for you. One on the Netflix content and then, on ESPN. For Netflix, you haven't mentioned, yet, what you're going to do with Lucasfilm and Marvel titles. Will those stay on a Pay 1 service? And if so, why not go direct right now? And then I have an ESPN question.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Well, what we're saying specifically is that the Disney-branded app will have the Disney and Pixar films. The disposition of the Marvel and Lucas or Star Wars films, we have not determined yet. We've had a discussion internally about how best to bring them to the consumer. It's possible we'll continue to license them to pay-service like Netflix, but it's premature to say exactly what we will do. We certainly have that opportunity. There's been talk about launching a proprietary Marvel service and Star Wars service, but we're mindful of the volume of product that would go into those services, and we want to be careful about that. We've also thought about including Marvel and Star Wars as part of the Disney-branded service, but there where we want to be mindful of the Star Wars fan and the Marvel fan and to what extent those fans are either overlapped with Disney fans or they're completely basically separate or incremental to Disney fans. So it's all in discussion. But we will say is that Disney Pixar will definitely part of this and not be part of any other pay window distributor in the United States. And disposition of Marvel and Star Wars we'll announce at a later date when we've determined what to do.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Okay. And then on ESPN and you're announcement today, what will change on the WatchESPN app? It's partly authenticated, but also you offer a lot of content on the ESPN3 service, which isn't really a channel but you've given more content to it. So how did WatchESPN evolve as you go more direct with your BAMTech idea?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Well, we don't intend to migrate product off the primary linear services. We've already licensed product to BAM that ESPN had licensed from third parties, and we will increase the amount of ESPN product that will be part of this service, particularly a lot of college sports. We're not getting specific yet about exactly what will come from where, but I did mention 10,000 live events. That is basically the estimate that we've got based on the inventory that we've taken on how many sporting events will be available through this very specific subscription service. Let me take a step back for a minute, just to give you a little bit of perspective about BAM too. What impressed us about BAM was, first of all, it's the most robust live streaming platform out there. When you think about live sports and how much a sporting event live is consumed basically concurrently by the masses, you need a very, very robust technology platform to serve that. BAM is the only one out there that has that. In addition, they have great essentially customer management systems and technology. That's everything from onboarding and retention to credit card management to password management. They also have good ad technology. Think about the opportunities in terms of dynamic ad insertion as a for instance. And they basically have very, very strong data management as well and the ability for us to mine user data so that we can get greater customization and personalization. So this is something, when we talk about the current ESPN app, while that app is a very robust app, it didn't have nearly the robust amount of product on it that I just described that enabled us to do the kind of things that we want to do. So as you think about the app going forward, you think about one app, it looks pretty similar to the app that you've got now, except it can do a lot more, all the things that I just described. You can use it as an authenticated subscriber of a multichannel service, which basically gives you access to the direct, to the streams of the ESPN channels, or you can buy up or buy additional sports products through the subscription, but again, it's the same seamless experience. And there'll be upsell opportunities for us as well. So you'll watch a highlight, if you want to buy maybe part of a game that's going on live, if you want to buy that game, you'll be able to buy it directly through the app or subscribe to the service directly through the app. It's basically a one-stop shopping for the consumer and it's one-stop shopping for us in terms of our ability to manage the consumer that wants to consume sports through ESPN.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Okay. Thank you, Bob.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: All right. Michael. Thank you. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from UBS.\nDoug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC: Oh, thanks so much. Bob, continuing along this theme, I'm just curious, are there restrictions in your current MVPD deals that hold you back from taking ESPN over-the-top, you know, the main channel until you're fully through the renewal cycle? And I'm curious if you envision distributors partnering with you to bundle and sell these services with their broadband or video services? And then I've got a follow-up.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: I'm not going to comment specifically about the agreements. There are elements to the agreement that \u2013 well, first of all, if we wanted to take ESPN direct, we could. There are elements to the distribution agreements that we have that would cause us to if we were to bring the service direct to the consumer or create some \u2013 I'll call them sub-optimal circumstances for us. I'm not going to get into detail about that. If we were to create a direct-to-consumer app that had the linear services, just as Netflix is distributed by multichannel servers out there or product out there, we would give our distributors an opportunity to distribute our app and other third parties as well.\nDoug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC: Do you think that ESPN is \u2013 we all think it's about $7 or $8 within the bundle. Do you think there's an opportunity for this direct-to-consumer service to show that ESPN is undervalued within the bundle? Do you think it's fairly priced within the bundle based on your research?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: I think you're kind of leading the witness a little bit there. I'm not going to comment on our pricing today or our potential pricing power going forward. The ESPN brand is still very strong. If you look at the array of sports that ESPN has licensed, whether it's major sports from the NFL to the NBA to Major League Baseball to all the college packages or the great tennis that we have, it's a very high-quality service that I think is very much in demand from consumers. It obviously has suffered a bit from the overall impact of digital technology and new forms of media consumption on the ecosystem. One of the reasons that we're doing this is because of the trends that we're seeing. But another reason that we're doing it is because of the strength of the brand and the opportunity that this technology and the consumer trends that the technology has created are providing. It's not just a defensive move, it's an offensive move.\nDoug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC: If I could ask one quick follow-up on the Disney service, where will the team that runs that service be housed? Will they be within one of the Disney units? Will they and the programming team that's going to be doing original TV and movie content be housed in a new unit?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: We're creating basically a management team that BAM will report to. Well actually, we're creating a board because we'll have a couple of outside owners. I will be Chairman of that board, and we'll manage essentially the technology platform that is BAM. ESPN will control in effect its own destiny in terms of what's called programming of the app and the disposition of sports rights, et cetera, and so on. And then we will create a team that will manage the Disney side, too. But the Studio, the Disney Channel team and our Interactive team will all create products specifically for that Disney-branded subscription product. And I'll be directly involved on both sides.\nDoug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: All right. Doug. Thank you. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: And our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you. Bob, you're having so much success with your Studio IP, not just the box office, but driving growth in the parks as well. I guess now that you have another \u2013 or let's say different outlet for growth with the announced Disney streaming service, is there consideration to increase your investment even further in the Studio?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Yes. What we're going to be doing \u2013 I think you have to look at it a different way, but it's a good question. We are going to be using our capital, increase \u2013 and it will represent increased spending that we hope to get a little bit more specific about either in the next earnings call or sometime at a later date when we have a little bit more visibility. But we've already begun the development process at the Disney Channel and at the Studio to create original TV series and original movies for this service. So if the Studio makes, let's call it, roughly 10 films a year or distributes 10 films a year \u2013 that includes Marvel and Pixar and Star Wars and Disney-branded and Disney Animation. We've commissioned them to make, to produce more films with the incremental films being produced very, very specifically and very exclusively for this service. So this will represent a larger investment in Disney-branded intellectual property, both TV and movies.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And then just a follow-up for Christine, if I may. The 3.5% sub loss, I think, you highlighted, I assume that's a net number with some of the current streaming services out there offsetting the traditional linear decline? And any color on how notable those maybe net adds either are now or likely to become in the coming quarters from what you see?\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: No. That is a net number, Alexia, and there were additional digital MVPDs this quarter that helped that number.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: All right. Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: All right. Thanks, Alexia. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: And our next question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein.\nTodd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Oh, hi. Thanks. Probably no surprise following along similar themes. A quickie and then a bigger one. So the quickie, just to confirm, I think this is probably clear. I just would love to confirm it with your relationship with Netflix. So other than the specific output that you identified from Disney and Pixar, and then we talked about Marvel and Lucasfilm, all the other relationships you have with Netflix in terms of licensed ABC content and kids content and original content for Netflix, is it safe to assume that you intend to continue partnering with them and doing work with them as makes sense over the future? Or is there any change to that? And I do have a follow-up. Thanks.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: There is no change from our side. I can't speak for them, but we've had a great relationship with them. We made a decision some years back to license them the Studio output deal. They paid us well for that, and they did well as well. It represented real anchor programming for Netflix before they had an opportunity to ramp up their own original production, which they've obviously done aggressively and quite successfully. The Marvel relationship is a perfect example of how well we've done with them in terms of creating original product. That's been very mutually beneficial. It's done well for them. They leveraged the strength of the Marvel brand, and it's done well for us as we mined our IP and obviously made money from it. They've also licensed a number of ABC shows. We hope they'll continue to do that. This doesn't represent a change except on the Disney Pixar side, and as I cited earlier, possibly on the output deal for Marvel and Star Wars films, which we're still discussing and debating.\nTodd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Fair enough. The follow-up \u2013 I'm struggling with how exactly to phrase this, but I'll do my best. When you think about a major strategic shift that you've announced in terms of your distribution, obviously your peers and competitors will be expected to react and respond as well. And so I know you won't comment on what you expect them to do, but I'm sure you've thought through the different scenarios that this could play out and the reactions ripple through the industry. I guess the specific best way I can phrase the question is a specific concern that many people have is if this causes more of your peers and competitors to go direct themselves, that you could imagine a non-sports better quality direct offering coming to be in some way that would perhaps be appealing to lots of households who maybe don't care about sports. And maybe that would be bad for ESPN. Any new thinking? Have you thought through the pros and cons of that? Would love your thoughts on those types of scenarios. Thanks.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: I'm still trying to get, figure out who's the peer and who's the competitor. We've kicked around a number of scenarios here, and frankly, the discussion that we've had isn't something that we necessarily want to disclose to the outside world. Frankly, I'm not sure that this step is going to make much of a difference in terms of the, we'll call it, the disposition of the health of the multichannel ecosystem. I think there are forces, whether they're technological in nature or sociological or economic in nature, out there that are changing the way media is consumed in general, and I don't think this is either going to hasten them or exacerbate things in any way. What it does do, though, is a couple of things. First of all, it gives us the ability to leverage the strength of our brands, which a lot of our peers and competitors do not have. Secondly, it gives us what we'd call optionality. It's a word I've not used very much in my life, but it gives us the flexibility, really, to move our product to the consumer in many new ways, ways that we've not been able to do before, because of just how strong this platform is that we bought control of. We are very excited about that. We think it sets this company up well no matter what changes occur in the media ecosystem. I think if there's a headline, it would be one Disney leveraging its brands to take advantage of technological and consumer trends, and giving us flexibility if there is major shifts or continuing changes that occur in the marketplace, which, right now, no one else has.\nTodd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: All right. Welcome to the club of people who use the word optionality. Thanks a lot for your thoughts, Bob.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: All right, Todd. Thank you. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Omar from Credit Suisse.\nOmar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the question. Just a couple from me. First to Christine, maybe. I wanted to ask about the guidance that you've given that you'll see earnings dilution from \u2013 so it's two years from the BAMTech acquisition. I'm wondering whether, Christine, you could just maybe help us understand, how much we might see in 2018 and 2019. Obviously, there's the consolidation impact from adding the service to your income statement, but then the release also mentioned investment in the Disney-branded service, so maybe you could just walk us through the 2018 and 2019 impact of those two developments. And then, just while you're thinking about that, maybe one for Bob. I have a question about the appetite for sports rights costs within ESPN in the context of the new service. So I guess the question is do you think that your sort of historical strategy of acquiring a very broad range of rights across multiple sports, big and small, will remain the case long-term in the context of the new service? Or do you think having a direct relationship with consumers and being able to tailor a service more closely to individuals might change that? Thank you.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Sure. Thanks, Omar. If you're talking about dilution as it relates to the acquisition of BAMTech, what we've said so far is that it will be modest for the next couple of years. We may get more specific on that when we come back at our year-end conference call in November, but, right now, we're just going to leave it as modestly dilutive. You've also asked about the investment that we'll be making in this new offering and how that would impact 2018. I think what you were asking is would it impact 2018 earnings, and the answer is there will be additional investment. We've not yet fully concluded what that is and the sequencing and timing of that spend. There'll also be content, as well as investment spending for technology, so the combination of those is something that we'll be prepared to speak with you more specifically later this year.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: And to the second part of your question, this acquisition and the subsequent launching of the service gives us, yet, another way to reach consumers, fairly-compelling way. In effect, an incremental way to monetize sports rights. With that, we have, we think, more of an opportunity to license sports rights for this service. Just as BAMTech has been in the market licensing sports for its subscription service, we'll continue to do that under us.\nOmar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thanks. That's clear.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay. Omar. Thank you. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Yes. Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups in the direct-to-consumer service, and then a different topic. Do you have any thoughts on pricing for either of the services? And will you include advertising? Or is it a 100% subscription? And the last part of this direct-to-consumer is, are you considering premium VOD, a premium VOD window as part of this? And then, the separate topic on advertising, the market pricing, it seems to be very strong, but almost no company has been able to take advantage of the pricing, obviously, due to ratings issues. In your view, how much is measurement? Or is it the lack of capture from nonlinear viewing? And could you talk about what you're doing currently to kind of fix however you see that problem?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay. Well, multiple questions. First of all, you mentioned something about a pay window. We're not planning to put our movie, to use this service to encroach on a theatrical window, if that's what you're asking.\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: We do hope to use this service to give people the ability to buy, to download-to-own or download-to-rent Disney movies in the window prior to pay, which used to be called the home video window. There is no reason why we shouldn't be doing that. But the priority here is this is a direct-to-consumer product, a subscription product. We do not intend on the Disney product to have advertising. Obviously, we do on the BAMTech side. I mentioned earlier they have some really strong ad technology and there are some great capabilities there and great opportunity to do a better job at monetizing, I'll call it, sports consumption but through the sale of advertising. I'm not sure I completely understand the last part of your question, partially because I was concentrating on answering the first few parts of the question. But was that about methodology? Jessica?\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I mean, average \u2013 the pricing for \u2013 generally every media company that has reported has talked about how strong the pricing and scatter pricing is. But you can't, you and everyone else can't take advantage of it because ratings have been so weak. Is it all measurement or is it the lack of capture of nonlinear viewing? And what are you doing to kind of take advantage of a relatively strong market? What will you change?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: We've definitely had some ratings challenges at ABC. So while the scatter marketplace as Christine noted, has been relatively strong. We, obviously, haven't taken advantage of the marketplace as much as we could have because of our ratings issues. So, I think, the first thing is it's got to change as we've got to have better performance. There's a whole other side to monetization which you alluded to. We've had some great, for instance, great consumption of our product in the C3, C7 window, and we would hope that particularly C7, who knows whether we'll ever monetize beyond that, would improve in terms of our ability to monetize. We also know that the entire, I'll call it traditional TV ecosystem, is disadvantaged in terms of sale of advertising because of our lack of access to consumer data. And that's something that we've got to improve. We've had \u2013 for instance on the ESPN front, we've had some really good success by monetizing ESPN out-of-home and also some success monetizing what we've been doing on the WatchESPN app, or streaming. The technology that we're gaining through Bam gives the ability to improve that significantly, significantly. How we leverage it to the ABC business, I'm not 100% sure at this point, but I think I've answered your question at least best I could. There are a variety of dynamics at stake in terms of why monetization of the ABC side isn't as strong as it could be, though.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Jessica. Operator, next question, please?\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citigroup.\nJason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I just had a question for Mr. Iger. Philosophically on pricing of these over-the-top apps, it seems like there is at least a handful of ways you could approach it, the one is maybe the way Amazon or Netflix do it where you could argue it's underpriced and they're either trying to drive Prime memberships or gain first-mover advantage. There's another model where the pricing is set to sort of insulate you from cannibalization risks, maybe the way your Hulu service at $40 has launched where you're sort of agnostic what the consumer does. I think CBS's apps are sort of similar to that. And then there's a third way you could price which is just to profit maximize on that standalone app, right, based on whatever your assessment is of the right price to maximize revenues. Can you just talk philosophically about how you're thinking about the retail price of these various apps, whether it's ESPN or Disney?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: We've given it a lot of thought but it's premature for us to make any announcements, frankly, because we're still considering a number of different factors, some, by the way, that you cited. Clearly, this is a real priority for us as a company in terms of getting it right. Not just getting it right from a program perspective, meaning the product itself. Getting it right from a user interface perspective, which BAMTech will obviously, provide us with, but also getting it right in terms of pricing and distribution. What we're going to go for here is significant distribution because we believe one way to be successful in the long run is for both of these services to reach a maximum number of people. That shouldn't suggest a huge discount on what we might be able to charge, but it should suggest at least initially a very reasonable approach to our pricing. We don't necessarily enter this with a notion that we're going to cannibalize our existing businesses significantly, but we have had a discussion about whether our pricing strategy can have an impact one way or the other on that. And again, because we haven't named a price for these yet, we haven't determined it. We have ranges here, obviously, because we've done some modeling. I think when we do, we'll give you the benefit of our thinking and exactly what it is we're trying to accomplish, but I think you have to look at both of these as huge priorities for the company. This is, what I would characterize as an extremely important, very, very significant strategic shift for us. We talked a lot about trends about direct-to-consumer, particularly intellectual property, creators, and owners having the ability to reach consumers directly. When you have a strong fan base like Disney has, or ESPN, that creates all forms of other opportunities in terms of tapping into customer passion for the brand and connection to the customer. Again, I'm going to put this at the top of our list in terms of company strategic priorities over the next number of years.\nJason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Jason. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Cahall from Royal Bank of Canada.\nSteven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hi. Just maybe switching gears to the parks for a few minutes, maybe the first question is you continued to defy gravity on the incremental margin at parks, and it looks like bookings are pretty strong domestically for the upcoming quarter. So is there any reason to think that the 20% to 30% incremental margins are not sustainable? And then separately, I think the comment on Shanghai was kind of an upgrade in terms of profitability versus the previous comment of being breakeven this year. So what do you think tracked ahead of your expectations for the year to deliver that result? Thanks.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay. Steve. I'll take the parks margin question. You are seeing nice margins. There has been consistent improvement on a quarterly basis. What you saw this quarter was the contribution of our International park operations kicking in, both Shanghai as well as Disneyland Paris. So, I think it's fair to assume that the management of the Parks segment is very committed to driving improvement in margin, and when you look at the investments we're making and the cadence with which we have of new attractions opening over the next couple of years, we expect those margins to stay strong and hopefully stay on the trajectory they're on now.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: On the Shanghai front, when we opened the park we were confident that we had built a great product, but we didn't know exactly how the market would react. And now over a year of operation, the market has reacted really well. To begin with, I mentioned earlier on the call we had 13 million visitors so far. Secondly, guest satisfaction is extremely high. Length of stay is a couple of hours longer per stay or per visit than we had anticipated, and about two-thirds of our visitation is coming from outside the Shanghai area. So as I've said before, this is basically a national tourist destination. So it is a very, very well-received product in China, and the nice news is, of course, that we have plenty of opportunity for expansion. And in fact, some of the expansion in construction is already underway, and Toy Story Land is going to open up next year. In terms of the specific impact to the bottom line, obviously when you have attendance at the level that we have, that, obviously, is a reason why the profitability is higher. We've had extremely high occupancy in our hotels. On the merch side and the food and beverage side a little bit less than we had expected, but not appreciably. And so the overall effect of great guest satisfaction and substantially greater visitation is an operation that in its first 14 months of service is more profitable than we anticipated.\nSteven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Steven. Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Perfect. Our last question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets.\nDaniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Bob, if we take a step back and look at the announcements here around BAMTech, around the direct-to-consumer apps, and in addition around significantly more investment in originals and exclusives for those services, obviously you've mentioned the Netflix deal, which you do not aim to renew. There's some moving pieces here in what you do with Star Wars and Marvel IP, but as we think about out-year operating income estimates, what are the other sort of key variables impacting your licensing revenue, impacting your programming and production expenses that we should sort of have in our heads as we think about the impacts of this significant change to improve the company over the long-term? I would think about pace of global roll-out as we talked about earlier, but what are the other things that you think are the key variables we should have in mind?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: I don't want to sound impertinent, I can't give you much guidance there. I can only say that you have to look at, first of all our \u2013 I'll call it our product cycle. With a slate of Marvel films that goes well into the next decade, and the same with the Star Wars front \u2013 on the Star Wars front and probably the strongest slate of Disney films that we've ever had in development, you have to consider the options from a revenue-generating perspective that that provides us in multiple windows, in multiple ways, whether it is licensed to third parties in a variety of forms or whether it's proprietary on our services, meaning subscription, et cetera, and so on. I also think you have to consider global trends in the direction of, as I said earlier, app based media consumption, over direct-to-consumer OTT services, which gives us the ability to improve our fortunes in terms of how we monetize the great IP and the strong brands that we have, whether it's in increased advertising revenue, whether it's in the, basically the value creation proposition of knowing the consumer better and mining data more effectively; whether it's in basically creating stronger bonds or stronger brand affinity. We've got this unbelievably passionate base of Disney consumers worldwide, and virtually all of our businesses except theme parks, we've never had the opportunity to even connect with them directly and know who they are. And it's high-time that we got into the business, particularly with the technology available to us, to accomplish that. Once we do, and this gives us the ability to do it, then I think the monetization possibilities are extraordinary for this company. There will be some sacrifices. Obviously, as you move product from, I'll call it, a licensed to third-party model to a self-distributed model, you're foregoing the licensing revenue that you'll get for whatever revenues you generate by all the things that I just described. We believe that ultimately, I can't give you an idea of when or how long, the profitability, the revenue-generating capability of this initiative is substantially greater than the business models that we're currently being served by.\nDaniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Thanks. I guess we'll look forward to those more details, next quarter. Thanks, Bob.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thank you, Dan.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: And thanks again, everyone, for joining us today.

Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast, and the webcast and the transcript will be available on our website. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob will lead off, followed by Christine, and then of course we'll be happy to take your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob and get started.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. We're extremely pleased with our results in Q2, and our continued strong performance both creatively and financially reflects what a profoundly productive and exciting era this is for the Walt Disney Company. And that's a direct result of our long-term strategic focus on creating the most compelling branded content, fully leveraging innovative technology and expanding our global presence. This strategy, along with our eagerness and proven ability to embrace change and disruption, ensures we constantly evolve in ways that are relevant to the market, exciting to our consumers and vital to our future. Our approach to the rapidly evolving media landscape is a great example and a timely one given the recent attention to that sector, especially ESPN. We recognized the early signs of a shift in the industry, anticipated its impact on our business, and adapted quickly with a strategy that reflects the evolving market. And we've been candid about the trends we're seeing which have been a key topic of discussion on these calls since 2015. The strength of the brand and consumer demand makes ESPN extremely attractive to new platforms and services entering the market which has led to ESPN content being featured on a growing array of over-the-top services, including Sling TV, Hulu, PlayStation Vue, DIRECTV and YouTube TV. Consumer response to these offerings is very encouraging. The substantial growth we're already seeing makes us bullish on the future of these nascent offerings. Right now, they are a small part of the pay TV universe, but we believe they'll be a much bigger part of the business going forward. And from a per sub pricing standpoint, these new services are just as valuable to us as traditional platforms. We're also taking full advantage of emerging trends by investing in the technology we need to create subscription products that give consumers direct access to our content from our early investment in Hulu to our recent ownership stake in BAMTech, which will launch a new ESPN-branded service later this year. ESPN continues to lead the industry when it comes to creating innovative digital products, and as we expand and enhance our mobile presence, we're seeing tremendous increases in mobile viewing. Almost 80% of the people who connect with ESPN each month access the content on mobile devices. In Q2, ESPN's suite of mobile apps reached a monthly audience of almost 23 million unique users who collectively spent more than 5.2 billion minutes engaging with ESPN on those platforms during the quarter. Mobile is clearly going to play a major role in the future of media, and ESPN is already taking great advantage of the trend with a broad portfolio of compelling apps. All of these steps create new ways to reach and engage consumers, which enhances the brand and its relevance in a changing market. While we're clearly excited about our success on new platforms, live sports continue to draw huge audiences to TV. ESPN's primetime audience in fiscal Q2 was up 15% year-over-year, and the inclusion of out-of-home viewing and WatchESPN lifted that audience by another 10%. ESPN also delivered its largest first quarter primetime audience in five years according to Nielsen, which reports on a calendar basis. We're confident in our strategy and ability to manage change across the entire company. In the last decade alone, we've navigated seismic shifts driven by technology, increased competition and changing consumer behavior that impact a variety of business sectors, from movies to merchandising, to theme parks. And the results include a studio that's breaking industry records, 11 separate franchises driving more than $1 billion each in annual retail sales and theme parks that are performing extremely well and expanding to meet the demand for Disney experiences across the world. Our Studio's extraordinary run continues. In fiscal 2017, we've already had two releases that topped $1 billion in global box office: Rogue One and Beauty and the Beast. With a strong opening weekend, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 just became the 15th consecutive Marvel movie to open at number one. It's already delivered $156 million in U.S. box office, bringing the worldwide total to $456 million to date, and we are expanding the presence of the franchise in our parks with our first Guardians of the Galaxy attraction opening at Disney's California Adventure later this month. As we've previously noted, we have an incredibly robust slate of great Marvel movies ahead with four releases in the next 14 months alone, including Thor: Ragnarok, Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War and Ant-Man and the Wasp. Fans are especially excited about Infinity War, which brings the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy together on screen for the first time ever, along with many, many more great Marvel characters. We've been thrilled with the creative momentum at Disney's live-action Studio. In addition to Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, which opens this month, the Studio is having tremendous success reimagining some of our most beloved characters and stories for a new generation. Beauty and the Beast is the latest in an impressive list of wildly successful films including Maleficent, Cinderella and Jungle Book and we've got more on the way including The Lion King, Dumbo, Aladdin and Mulan. We have also got an extraordinary slate from Pixar. Cars 3, the next great story in the Cars franchise, opens in June and Coco, a heartfelt tale of music and family, will be in theaters this Thanksgiving. We're also looking forward to The Incredibles 2 in the summer of 2018 and the 2019 release of Toy Story 4, which opens a new chapter for one of Pixar's most beloved franchises. Disney Animation is also having a great run with Zootopia taking the Oscar for Best Animated Feature and Moana earning two Oscar nominations and generating $640 million in global box office. In 2019, we'll release Frozen 2, one of the most anticipated sequels in animation history, and in the tradition of great stage adaptations, Disney Animated Classics, Frozen the Musical opens for a limited run in Denver this summer before moving to Broadway next spring. Turning to Star Wars, anticipation is already building for the December release of The Last Jedi and interest is also strong for the Han Solo origin film, which will be followed by Star Wars: Episode IX. And as we speak, construction is underway on two new Star Wars Lands at Disneyland and Disney World that will transport guests into that incredible storytelling universe and make them part of the adventure. And there's more exciting news from our Parks and Resorts. In the next few days, Shanghai Disney Resort will welcome its 10 millionth guest. As the resort has become a true national destination in China, attendance is outpacing our most optimistic projections and the park's performance is exceeding our expectations. The addition of the new Toy Story Land will only add to the park's popularity and is just the first of several planned expansions in Shanghai. Our long-term strategy and our proven ability to execute it over the last decade is paying off in countless ways across the company and ensures our legendary 94-year-old company remains vibrant and relevant to each new generation of consumers. In the near-term, as we previously noted, we expect to deliver modest growth for fiscal 2017 with a return to more robust growth in fiscal 2018 and beyond. I'm going to turn the call over to Christine to take you through the details of our quarter, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Christine?\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.50 which represents an increase of 10% compared to Q2 last year after adjusting for certain items affecting comparability. Parks and Resorts delivered another strong quarter with operating income growth of 20%, driven by increases at Shanghai Disney Resort and our domestic parks and resorts. As I discussed during last quarter's earnings call, second quarter results benefited from one week of the winter holiday shifting into the quarter. However, this benefit was more than offset by the timing of the Easter holiday, which fell entirely in Q3 this year compared to Q2 last year. We estimate these two items had an adverse impact on the year-over-year growth in operating income of eight percentage points, or about $45 million. We are very pleased with the continued progress we're seeing at Shanghai Disney Resort. The resort was modestly profitable during the second quarter, and while we expect an operating loss for the third quarter due to seasonality, we still expect the resort to breakeven for the fiscal year. At our domestic parks, growth in operating income was largely due to higher attendance, partially offset by higher costs. I will note that our domestic operations delivered Q2 records for revenue and operating income. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 4% in the quarter despite a net adverse impact of about two percentage points due to the timing of the winter and Easter holidays. Per capita spending in the parks was comparable to last year. Since Easter shifted out of Q2 this year and the 60th anniversary celebration at Disneyland Resort was behind us, we offered seasonal promotions during the quarter to drive attendance growth. Admission spending was in line with prior year with the impact of these promotions offsetting pricing increases. At our domestic hotels, per room spending was up 1% and occupancy levels of 88% were comparable to last year. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing down 4%, primarily reflecting the timing of promotions and reduced room inventory due to rehabs and conversions at a couple of our hotels, while booked rates are up 11%. Overall, we feel great about the performance of our parks business. Segment operating margin was 17.4% for the second quarter, up 150 basis points over Q2 last year despite an estimated net adverse impact of about 90 basis points due to the shift in the winter and Easter holidays. At Studio Entertainment, operating income was up 21% due to increases in television distribution and home entertainment, partially offset by lower film share revenue as sales of Star Wars and Frozen merchandise were higher in the prior year. TV distribution results were primarily due to international growth and higher domestic rates, partially offset by the timing of domestic title availabilities. Growth in our home entertainment business was driven by a greater sales mix of new release and Blu-ray titles and reflects the performance of key titles such as Moana and Doctor Strange during the second quarter this year compared to The Good Dinosaur, Inside Out and Ant-Man in Q2 last year. On the Theatrical side, we are extremely pleased with the performance of Beauty and the Beast in the quarter and the carryover performance of Rogue One and Moana. However, operating income was comparable to prior year, given the strong performance of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Zootopia during Q2 last year. At Media Networks, operating income was down 3% in the quarter as growth in Broadcasting was more than offset by lower equity income from Hulu and A&E and a decline at Cable. Cable results reflect a decline at ESPN partially offset by growth at Disney Channels and Freeform. At ESPN, higher programming and production expenses were partially offset by higher affiliate and advertising revenue. As I've previously mentioned, we expected ESPN's programming costs to be up meaningfully in the second quarter due to the impact of the first year of our new NBA rights deal and the shift of three College Football Playoff games into Q2 compared to last year. I'll remind you that this year, ESPN aired three of the New Year's Six bowl games during the second quarter, whereas it aired all six games during the first quarter last year. Ad revenue at ESPN was up 5% in the second quarter as higher rates were partially offset by a decrease in impressions. We estimate Q2 ad revenue was down 1% excluding the impact of the three additional bowl games. Turning to Broadcasting, growth in operating income was due to an increase in program sales and higher affiliate revenue, partially offset by higher programming costs and lower ad revenue. Higher operating income from program sales resulted from the sale of Iron Fist and higher sales of How to Get Away with Murder during the second quarter compared to the sale of Daredevil last year. Higher programming costs were due to a greater mix of third-party programs and contractual rate increases for acquired programming. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was down about 2% in the second quarter as higher pricing was more than offset by a decrease in impressions. Quarter to date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 23% above upfront levels. Total Media Networks' affiliate revenue was up 4% in the quarter due to growth at both Cable and Broadcasting. The increase in affiliate revenue was the result of seven points of growth due to higher rates partially offset by a three point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. This quarter, we experienced a slight change in the rate of sub losses. I'll note that the magnitude of the change was less than half a point compared to what we experienced during the first quarter. At Consumer Products and Interactive Media, operating income was up 3% in the second quarter as higher operating income from our games business was partially offset by a decline in merchandise licensing. Games results benefited from the discontinuation of our vertical console games businesses in the second quarter last year. Merchandise licensing results were lower in the quarter, reflecting strong sales of Star Wars and Frozen merchandise in Q2 last year. As we look to the third quarter, there are a couple of comparability items I want to highlight. As I've noted in the past, we expect fiscal 2017 cable programming costs to be up 8% versus fiscal 2016 driven primarily by $600 million in incremental expense associated with the first year of our new NBA contract. We expect $400 million of that increase in the third quarter, which will be the biggest driver of a 16% increase in total cable expenses. At Parks and Resorts, we anticipate Q3 costs will increase meaningfully versus prior year largely to support underlying volume growth and a variety of growth initiatives. These include the openings of Pandora \u2013 The World of Avatar at Animal Kingdom, Guardians of the Galaxy \u2013 Mission: Breakout! at Disney California Adventure and Explorers Lodge Hotel at Hong Kong Disneyland. Higher costs also include a full quarter of operations at Shanghai Disney Resort and will reflect an 18-day dry-dock of the Disney Fantasy. I also want to update our CapEx forecast for the year. Given changes in timing of a number of projects under development, we now expect CapEx for fiscal 2017 to be $200 million lower than prior year. During the second quarter, we repurchased about 18.6 million shares for about $2 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, we've repurchased 41.5 million shares for approximately $4.4 billion. As you know, we've always taken a disciplined and balanced approach to allocating capital and in how we manage our balance sheet, which has served our shareholders well. Given the lower than expected CapEx and improved operating cash flow, coupled with our continued confidence in our business, we are increasing our share repurchase target by $2 billion to $9 billion to $10 billion for the year. Overall, we feel good about the financial results we delivered this quarter and for the first half of the year, and we are still on track to deliver modest growth in earnings per share for fiscal 2017. I'll now turn the call back over to Lowell, and we'd be more than happy to take your questions.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay. Thank you, Christine. Operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Thank you very much. My first question is on the parks. There's a lot of excitement around the expansion of Animal Kingdom later this month. Can you talk about what the levers are for further financial growth at the parks sort of in general, not just in Orlando? I guess when you look at how far you've come in terms of margin expansion over the last, say, five years, I guess I'm trying to want to put the drivers specifically for the next leg of \u2013 is it attendance, price, longer stays or perhaps all of the above?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: The answer would be all of the above. We have a lot of investment activity actually across the globe in that segment. You mentioned Avatar, which opens just in a couple of weeks. We're building two Star Wars Lands, as you know, in Orlando and in Anaheim. We're opening a new hotel in Hong Kong. We opened Iron Man recently. We just announced a $1.4 billion expansion of the Hong Kong Park. We intend with our partner, OLC, to continue to grow our business in Tokyo. And of course, we've talked about what we're doing in Paris, which is all aimed at long-term investment and long-term growth, and then we had a quarter of profitability at Shanghai. I mentioned in my comments that we're just days away from Shanghai hitting 10 million people in attendance, which is nicely ahead of where we thought we would be because the year anniversary is in June. And we are already building to expand there. So we think we've got opportunities to continue to grow that. And of course, we've got two new cruise ships in the works and a number of other plans as it relates to our hotel business. So we think that we've got room on pricing there. It's not just about taking pricing up. It's just about being more strategic at how we price, particularly how we manage demand, and we've taken a number of steps there. We think we can expand length of stay with some \u2013 across the globe actually with some of these investments. We have some nice pricing leverage with our hotels. We actually are comping nicely in hotel rates, particularly in Orlando as a for instance, but we have an opportunity to expand. And again, our global footprint continues to grow, particularly when you consider expansion in Hong Kong, in Paris and ultimately in Shanghai. So I think there are a lot of levers here. We also have a business that has been great at managing its costs. They'll go up somewhat this coming quarter with the quarter that we're in because of some of the investments we've talked about, but they've managed their costs to continue to improve margins. And we don't see any reason why that can't continue.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And, Bob, just a quick follow-up on the box office. You've had such a huge success there and a great pipeline ahead. I guess, are there any concerns at all that the windows may change or it move to premium video-on-demand that may become a reality, and therefore somewhat disruptive to a system that's clearly working for you?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: I know that there's been a lot of conversation about it. In fact, I saw the head of AMC on CNBC just earlier talking about it. We're actually not in conversations right now for premium VOD window, because frankly, the way we have structured our Studio business was roughly 10 tent-poles a year and profitability that has continued to grow nicely, we don't really believe that there is a need for us to move that product off of the big screen any faster than we currently are or to do so in a concurrent manner to the big screen experience. The movies we make are perfect for consumption on the big screen and we've also created global phenomenon with our films where the people seem to all want to go see them en masse as witnessed by this past weekend's results from Guardians of the Galaxy. So we're not concerned about it. We're not really engaged in it. It doesn't seem to be anything that we're considering anytime soon. We'll obviously watch developments, but if it makes sense for us to do it, to grow our business, I imagine we'll be open-minded about it, but nothing now. I'm glad you brought up movies, because to the question you asked about our parks, another opportunity that we have to grow that business is by mining the great IP made by our studio. And so just in terms of increasing attendance and doing all the things that we talked about doing, continuing to infuse the parks with more of our IP, Frozen going into Hong Kong, as a for instance, a great example of that, Guardians of the Galaxy, Star Wars, all those things. Clearly, our demand \u2013 or the demand for our parks has gone up as people have engaged more with our popular IP.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Alexia. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from Moffett. Your line is open.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Thanks. Bob, I have one for you on ESPN. It's not about subscribers. It's not about programming costs. It's about SportsCenter. And I think from consumption patterns you see that people are not tuning into SportsCenter the way maybe they used to in a pre-digital world. I wonder what does ESPN need to do on-air to respond to that challenge. And what are you doing mobile-ly for ESPN to stay relevant on the newsgathering side?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: I'll start with the second part of your question, Michael. ESPN is taking a number of steps on their mobile business, particularly consolidation of their apps and improving engagement, interface with the consumer, customization, personalization and use of video on the apps to grow engagement significantly. The numbers have been tremendous and also, I should add, the watch app which is also really working nicely, and that's going to continue to grow and they've got fairly big plans to do that. I think we all know that in today's world, people are accessing their mobile devices to get sports scores, highlights and varying forms of statistics and information about sports greater than they ever did. It is nothing that we can really do, I think, to slow that down except it's important for us to participate in it and that's what we're doing. That said, John Skipper and the ESPN team have made a number of moves already on the personnel front and will continue to in terms of moving people around and making the best of, basically, the talent that ESPN has. In addition to that, they are looking at some program changes overall in terms of how the networks are programmed, all with an eye toward addressing not only where consumers are today, but improving our non-life sports programming numbers. And we're not sitting on our hands. Actually, there's a lot of engagement about it, but I'd say that the best thing that we can possibly do is to continue doing what we're doing, which is to make that mobile experience great. And we are and our numbers \u2013 by the way, they're far above the numbers of any competitors in the space. And so while we've seen a lot of consumption basically migrate from live channels on news and information to mobile devices, we've taken advantage of that and we believe the money will follow. We obviously are engaging with our advertisers in basically forming packages that are combined live \u2013 I'm sorry, not live, but channel packages, as well as digital packages, actually ESPN's advertising mostly combined in that regard, and advertising continues to grow on the digital side and we feel bullish about it. And use of video is important, too.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Thank you, Bob.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: If you'll notice, Michael, you'll notice on the most recent iteration on your phone, if you use ESPN, the presence of that video player is much greater and the opportunity to personalize or customize it where you name the teams or the sports that are your favorites, and more and more, you're more likely to get a highlight of one of those teams or one of those sports in that video player, that's a big deal. And you'll see more of that.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Michael. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Pretty sure that's Ben Swinburne, but I'll ask my question and hope that this is on.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: We'll go with you, Ben.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, Lowell. Bob, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, I think, that you're seeing substantial growth already for some of these new stream platforms. You mentioned on CNBC earlier that you think that these services will appeal to a newer consumer, a more price-sensitive consumer and help offset some of the traditional losses. So given you have better information than we do, maybe you could just elaborate a bit on that why you're optimistic and raising the buyback to boot? And then on the Studio side, people obviously are nervous a bit about sort of the profitability levels being at peak margins for the Studio. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how much more room you see or at least the sustainability in the kind of splits you're driving with particularly the exhibitors, given how much the box office is driving the business? I'm thinking both about the U.S. and also globally where the typical splits are lower for the Studio side of the business model.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Well, I'll touch upon the last one first. Given the success of the Studio to date, the last few years, and given the slate that is ahead, there isn't a studio that is more important to the distributors than The Walt Disney Company, particularly when you consider the amount and the brands, Pixar, Marvel, Disney, and of course, Star Wars. And when you look at the slate coming up with Pirates and Cars and Thor and Coco and The Last Jedi, and more Marvel movies; Black Panther and Avengers and Han Solo, Incredibles and Ant-Man, and I could go on, we have a really great relationship with the distributors. We've enabled them to grow and they are enabling us to grow, and we believe that more growth will and should come from that business. One of the reasons why we're not engaged in discussions on this premium VOD window is because what we've got going is working and we have no reason to disrupt that right now. We are making movies that people want to see in the large screen venues that are being built worldwide. And that gives us some leverage with them, yes, but it's also very mutually beneficial. The buyback, we feel confident in where the company is going. We obviously have a great balance sheet. We have the wherewithal to continue to access capital to not only invest in some of the things that we talked about but to manage expansion down the road. And so this is \u2013 as you know, we've had a blend of ways that we're returning capital to our shareholders with increased dividends, continued buybacks, and of course, very, very successful large acquisitions when the opportunity has come along and growth in our stock. So this is just part of what has been an ongoing strategy. And as Christine mentioned, because of some reduction in capital expenses that we expected this year, we felt we had excess capital and looking at opportunities to pass that back to shareholders we thought particularly given what we see as the future of our company that this was a good buy for us and a good buy for our shareholders. This is a long \u2013 you asked a lot of questions. On the distribution and the ESPN front and the new OTT platforms, first of all, give us a little bit of credit for being very candid with all of you on an earnings call two summers ago when we talked about sub losses in the expanded basic bundle. We did that because, one, we wanted to be candid; and two, we wanted to signal that we had our eyes wide open about what was going on and we fully intended to address what we were seeing and what we've continued to see. It enabled us to take a number of steps to deal with the issue in a way that long-term will serve this company very well. And what we've done is we have negotiated deals with all these new distributors. By the way, they've concluded that launching new platforms without ESPN is very challenged. Launching it with ESPN gives them an ability to penetrate the marketplace in ways that they wouldn't be able to without it. And so we're \u2013 we've done deals, as you know, with Sony Vue and AT&T Direct and Sling and YouTube, which launched a month ago, and Hulu most recently, and there are others entering the marketplace. We've seen really nice growth there, but it's nascent, and the growth that we've seen in number of subs so far has not made up for the losses that we have seen in the expanded basic service. Those losses have come from cord-nevers, cord-cutters and what had been a migration to lighter packages on those platforms that did not include ESPN. It has been a blend, and it's been fairly steady, which is why we continued to focus on distributing on these new platforms, which we think provide opportunities for us and for consumers in a variety of ways. First of all, they are more user-friendly. The interface is typically better because it's newer. They are more mobile-friendly as well. The combination of those as well as the pricing we believe makes them more attractive to people in lower economic brackets as well as a new generation or a younger generation of consumers. And that is very, very important to us. Live sports works on those platforms, and young consumers want live sports. And we've got the best array of them. And so we continue to engage with them. We continue to feel optimistic about what we're seeing. We're also mindful of what's going on with what I'll call the traditional business, which is why we are doing what we're doing with our apps business, which is why we're invested in BAMTech because we believe another area of growth for this company is in the direct-to-consumer space, not just with ESPN but with our other brands, and not just in the U.S. but worldwide. And we intend to launch an ESPN-branded service direct-to-consumer by the end of the year. And a lot's been said about the cost reductions at ESPN. We're managing that business efficiently. We always have. We always will. Obviously, there's probably a greater need to do it given some of the challenges that we've seen near term, but frankly, what we've been doing in terms of scale, in terms of size, is not all that significant when you consider that ESPN has 8,000 employees and we reduced by about 100 a few weeks ago. I don't take it lightly. But the number was \u2013 it gets headlines, but when you think about it in the scheme of things, or if you just look at it against basically the number of on-air people that ESPN has, it wasn't a particularly significant number or reduction. But we do believe we need to manage it more efficiently. And we also continue \u2013 we will continue to be aggressive at buying live sports rights, which have not gotten cheaper, we understand, but they have gotten more valuable. And new entrants into the marketplace like Amazon and the talk of others like Facebook only prove the point that we just made, that live sports is important to new digital platforms, and live sports is important to anyone who is trying to reach consumers in the media business.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for all the color.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay. Ben, thanks for the question. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from UBS. Your line is open.\nDoug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC: Oh, thanks so much. I think I want to continue along the lines on ESPN. But just to flesh out, Bob, you've been talking more, I believe, about investing in the technology necessary to build ESPN direct-to-consumers, and you've talked about what you wanted to launch by year-end. Has part of the discussion that you implied in your prepared remarks suggest that there is a plan to launch the full ESPN service direct-to-consumer at some point in time and what kind of timeframe? And if there is no timeframe, what would the marketplace triggers be that would cause such a service to become a reality? And I'll just ask a follow-up for Christine. I believe over the next five years, ESPN has all of its affiliate renewals, and I think once you're past this June quarter, the sports cost structure is also pretty locked in until about fiscal 2022. I was just hoping you'd confirm whether or not I'm accurate on that. Thank you.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Doug, we don't have plans right now to take ESPN as it is currently distributed on both new and traditional distributors and go direct with it. Will that eventually happen? I think probably, but there is no plans right now to do that. There are complications as it relates to our current relationships with distributors, and frankly, we don't really feel that we've got a great need to do that. However, ESPN has a large array of rights that it can sell, what I'll call, off traditional platform that it can aggregate as a whole or it can sell individually on technology that frankly is working. The streaming capabilities at scale of BAM are extraordinary, and we've seen what's going on with mobile device consumption of video, and there's just a great opportunity to take inventory that ESPN has, take advantage of the technology that's out there and grow a business in the direct-to-consumer space that frankly we have not been in. And we're encouraged with what we've seen already in terms of technology and in terms of some of the entities that have already been out there selling in the direct-to-consumer space, obviously, and believe that we have a lot of opportunity to participate in that business. But currently, we don't have plans to take the channel and just basically make it available direct, but I'm guessing that \u2013 and I'm not giving you any timetable at all \u2013 but it's not very near, but there is an inevitability to that.\nDoug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC: No, that's perfect. Thank you.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: So, Doug, it's Christine. Your qualification of the affiliate renewals coming up over the next five years through 2022, that timeframe is about right.\nDoug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC: And then on the sports cost side, I think, this is relatively straightforward because most of the deals are well known, but after the June quarter when we look out over the next five years, other than maybe something from the Big Ten, there's nothing else significant coming through?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: That would be correct. The NBA is the last big one for a while. We've not said anything more about new packages, but there's nothing looming that is anything close to the size of the NBA or the NFL or Major League Baseball.\nDoug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC: All right. Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Doug, thank you. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Omar Sheikh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nOmar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. Just had a couple of questions. First of all for Bob, I just want to continue the theme on the direct-to-consumer strategy. You touched upon the position that BAMTech will have in that. I wonder if you could maybe just flesh out a little bit what sort of content you're thinking of putting into a BAMTech-delivered product. And for example, whether or not you think it will be predominantly subscription-based product or ad-funded as well? That would be useful. And then just a follow-up for Christine. I don't know whether in your prepared remarks, Christine, you touched on this, but I wonder if you could just give us a number for maybe some guidance on Q3 pacings for Cable Net ad revenue. Thanks.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: There were a number of aspects of the BAMTech business that impressed us tremendously. One I mentioned, which is their ability to offer streaming live video at scale. The other was their ad insertion technology. We're extremely impressed with what they've built in terms of advertising revenue generation capabilities, and any business that we've contemplated with them would include a blend of subscription and advertising. In terms of product, it's really premature to suggest what it would be except there seems to be people jumping to conclusion that there would be sort of a one-size-fits-all product that went to the marketplace, and that's not what we're thinking at all. We actually believe that one of the benefits of direct-to-consumer business is to give consumers the opportunity to buy either subscriptions that are shorter in nature or limited in nature or specifically targeted to things that they're interested in, like a given sport or a given team or a given region in a given period of time. So while I think it's possible that there'll be an omnibus sports \u2013 multiple sports package offered direct-to-consumer, it's more likely that consumers will have an opportunity to buy the sports they want when they want it as well. So I think it's early to really to be \u2013 to get more defined because we haven't announced anything, but we're certainly working with them on bringing a product forward before the end of calendar 2017.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay. Omar, I'll touch on the Q3 ad sales pacing. So in my comments, I did mention that ad sales are pacing down and this is for ESPN, I think, that you're referring to and that's reflecting the softness that we're seeing in the overall advertising marketplace. We are, however, very pleased with what we're seeing with the NBA. There's strong demand for the NBA inventory, and the rating strength to date is encouraging. The teams that are remaining in the playoffs suggest that the performance in the Conference Finals should be strong. We're also encouraged by live sports. There's a couple of sporting events that did quite well recently. Total audience growth was strong in the recent NFL Draft, and we've also seen some very strong Major League Baseball games and also the Women's NCAA Championship Game that was just recently played. I'd also like to touch on more broadly just what we're seeing in the ad market. We are optimistic as we head into the upfront. And over the past year, we've successfully sold impressions across the ESPN platform, and we're confident that this strategy is going to continue to serve us well, particularly now that Nielsen is measuring all those live impressions as one number. Bob talked in his comments about the reach and growth of our platform, and that's everything from linear, out-of-home, over-the-top, WatchESPN, mobile, digital and we're quite uniquely positioned with this platform to deliver expansive reach to our very desirable audience. So this unique positioning provides us with optimism that we'll have a very successful upfront.\nOmar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thank you, Omar. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.\nTodd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. I think I'm related to Ben. So at the risk of driving you guys crazy, I'm sorry that the questions I really want to ask happen to be about Media Networks, too, so sorry about that. But here they are. One question is I'd love your thoughts about the sort of sister networks at ESPN. Just listening to your comments, Bob or Christine, about the multichannel universe and the different emerging options for consumers, just wondering where you think about the future of ESPN Classic, ESPNEWS, ESPNU and those brands in that evolving world? That's one. And then the second question, I'd just love, I guess, Bob, if you wouldn't mind just reconciling, there are some of your peers who are saying it's inevitable there will be a non-sports type of skinny bundle offering that comes to the market. But then I hear \u2013 we listen to you, right, point out that no such thing exists yet, and that it seems like in your point of view that without sports, it's hard to succeed with one of these services. So those are two very different point of views. Do you believe, I guess, that it's possible or that there's a marketplace for a non-sports bundle? Or is that just not in the U.S. market something that you think has very much consumer appetite? Thank you.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Someone was out there today talking about a $10 bundle that didn't include sports. I don't know how many channels you could fit into a $10 bundle, but I would imagine there wouldn't be any channels that were particularly attractive. Maybe someone will go out with a very low cost set of channels that can't drive the kind of fees that \u2013 the more popular ones. So I'm not sure. But I don't see how that's practical in terms of gaining much penetration. In terms of other channels, ESPN programs, it's other channels well. Clearly, the channels that have the most live sports are the ones that have been the most successful in terms of sub fees and ad revenue and ratings. They've launched some \u2013 SEC Network would be the best example; they've been quite successful in that regard. We've reduced some of the investment in some of the other channels, but I think it's safe to say that ESPN is going to be out there with a multiple channel \u2013 multichannel product for the foreseeable future.\nTodd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Hey, Todd, thank you. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Your line is open, sir.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet: Thanks very much for taking my question. No ESPN questions for me tonight. But I wanted ask you, Bob, about Disney leadership. With your contract extension complete and congratulations on that, would you share with us a little bit about how you and the board finally came to that decision; maybe why it took a little longer than some may have thought? And you previously talked about Lucasfilm and Shanghai as two key priorities of yours. Do you have incremental priorities for the company between now and mid-2019 when your contract does come up? And then maybe talk about is there a way this time around to ensure a smoother succession plan for Disney leadership come mid-2019? And then just a follow-up for Christine, I did want to ask about Consumer Products and the opportunity there in the back half. What is the opportunity? Could Consumer Products really accelerate here in the back half, given the pipeline of IP coming to market in the summer and for the holiday period? Thank you.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: So Anthony, I'm going to try not to be too impertinent, but there's been, I think, more made about our succession than it really deserves, suggesting that there's been trouble on the succession front here, and I will only go back to 2005 when I was chosen from being COO of the company for five years to be the CEO and the successor to Michael Eisner, and I don't want to characterize my tenure over that period of time, but we had a smooth transition. I moved into the role after having studied under Michael for five years. I overlapped with him for six months between the time I was named and the time that he left. And it was \u2013 frankly, it was seamless. The board made a decision after deliberating for probably six months to nine months, so I think it was extremely thorough, we considered an internal candidate and a number of outside candidates, and it worked as far as \u2013 at least as far as I can tell. I am confident that the board will conduct yet another successful succession process. The decision that was made in terms of my staying longer was, in fact, had a number \u2013 there were a number of factors, some that are very personal. I've been in this job for 12 years. It's a job that I have loved from the moment that I got it. I had a few more things that I wanted to accomplish, I can talk about that, but frankly, the number one priority of mine was making sure that we have another successful transition process, and I thought by giving it another year, I increased the possibility of that happening, and increased the possibility, frankly, of more opportunities for the people within this company as well. So that is my number one priority. I'd say that's probably the board's number one priority. We have enough time to not only consider the right candidates, but to make the right decision and to craft a handover of sorts or a transition that should be successful. There are other things that are clearly at the top of my list in terms of priorities, but there are \u2013 I think they're pretty obvious. It's continuing to grow the company in the digital direction, it's continuing to grow the company globally, it's continuing to solidify ESPN's future by doing the things that I talked about on this call and probably above all that, which is tied in part to succession, but it goes beyond succession, it's making sure that the leadership of this company across the board continues to be really strong so they can deliver the kind of results that everybody expects of us.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet: That's awesome. Thank you.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay. Anthony, turning to Consumer Products, I think you remember that I previously said that full fiscal year 2017 would be driven by our second-half performance in the segment. We still expect strong growth in the second half and it will be driven by two very important IP franchises: Cars and Spider-Man. Both the Cars 3 movie, which releases on June 17, and Spider-Man, which releases on July 7, we're looking very much forward to those releases and we are very optimistic that the two franchises and the merchandise licensing from that will drive a very strong second half performance and our business overall.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet: Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: All right, Anthony. Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Steven Cahall from Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.\nSteven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yes. Thank you. Just one on parks and then a quick follow-up. On the parks, you've continued, I think, to sort of defy gravity with the incremental margin and you talked a lot about the incremental revenue opportunities, so I was wondering if you could shed any light on maybe some initiatives that you have on the cost side, particularly, as you probably reached (51:27) CapEx here and can throw a bit more resource at the cost. And then with the increase in the buyback, just sort of a longer-term question. If we do happen to get to a point where your cash taxes come down materially, how do you think about how to deploy that incremental free cash flow? Thank you.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: So on parks, in my comments, I mentioned that in the third quarter, parks expenses actually would be up in the third quarter year-over-year. And we anticipate those costs being up because of underlying growth, as well as the launching of some major new initiatives which are coming online. You've heard them a few times here, Avatar, Guardians of the Galaxy at Disneyland as well as a new hotel in Hong Kong. We also have that first full quarter of Shanghai operations in the third quarter, so that'll also impact our expense growth. And we also \u2013 it's worthy of mention that we have an 18-day dry-dock of one of our four cruise ships, the Disney Fantasy. So for the quarter, the expenses will be up for the parks segment.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: I think as it relates to, I'll say, margins, I think you were asking more about cost savings, is when we look at margin expansion, we're not just looking at cost savings. We start with the fact that we offer a premium experience. And in order to offer the experience that we offer, we operate these parks across the globe at an industry-leading level or an industry-leading way. The quality of service is part of our \u2013 the brand proposition of our parks to the world, quite frankly, and that takes a cost structure that needs to be supported. We always look, though, to run it more efficiently. Technology has been our friend in that regard. Some of the steps that we've taken already by deploying technology, whether it's on the sales front, the ticketing front or the overall customer interaction or whether it's on the operations front, have obviously helped. But there are also opportunities on the pricing front. I talked about them earlier. It's not just about raising prices. It's about a strategic approach to pricing that are also designed not only to increase attendance but to improve margins. So we don't look at it just as a savings initiative. We look at it as a combination of revenue generation and cost efficiency, combined obviously with no loss of service \u2013 of quality of service, which is imperative for us.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: And, Steve, I know you had a question on the buyback, but could you repeat the question?\nSteven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yes. It was more of a longer-term question that if the Animal Spirit convened in Washington and we end up with more cash because tax comes down, how do you think about incremental deployment of cash in a much more tax-friendly environment?\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Well \u2013 no, I think the best way to think about that is we would carefully consider it. It would be a great problem to have to consider, tax reform, so it's just one of many things that we would consider. But we have been consistent with our buyback year after year, and I would just leave it at that.\nSteven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Steven, thank you and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.

Please note that this conference is being recorded. And I'll now turn the call over to your host, Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Lowell, you may begin.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Company: Good afternoon, and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast, and we will post a transcript and a copy of the webcast to our website. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob will lead off, followed by Christine, and then, of course, we'll be happy to take your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob and we can get started.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon. We're very happy with our results for the quarter and we continue to be extremely confident in our ability to drive significant, long-term growth. Coming off an historic performance last year, including more than $7.5 billion in global box office, we're thrilled with the continued success of our Studio in the first quarter. All three films released by the Studio in the quarter were global hits. Marvel's Doctor Strange became the latest addition to Marvel Studios' winning streak, generating $670 million in global box office and sending us into the new fiscal year with some great momentum. We followed that success with Disney Animation's newest musical masterpiece, Moana, which has achieved total worldwide box office of $555 million, along with two Oscar nominations for outstanding animated feature and original song. We're incredibly proud of this movie as well as Zootopia, which topped $1 billion in box office and also earned an Oscar nomination. Rogue One, our first standalone Star Wars Story also connected with audiences in a big way. It's our first $1 billion movie of the fiscal year as well as our fourth $1 billion release in calendar 2016, further demonstrating the incredible strength of this franchise. Star Wars: The Last Jedi, otherwise known as Episode VIII, will open in December and I just saw it last week. It's a great next chapter in the iconic Skywalker family saga. It will be followed by our Han Solo origin film, which is just going into production. Our Studio's next release is our live-action Beauty and the Beast premiering in March. The anticipation and excitement around this movie is astonishing. The first trailer drew more than 127 million online views in the first 24 hours, breaking the record held by Star Wars: The Force Awakens. And the trailer we released last week also generated more than 100 million views. The first week of ticket pre-sales has also been very strong reminiscent of pre-sales for some of our biggest Marvel movies. After Beauty, we have Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 opening in May. It's another great Marvel film with even more of the fantastic action and humor that made the original Guardian such a breakout hit. We'll follow that with another grand adventure, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales in a new story that captures everything audiences have always loved about this franchise. Pixar's Cars 3 will give fans an original twist on the world of Cars this summer with a brand new story and some great new characters. And in November, we'll release Coco, another brand new original story from Pixar, as well as Marvel's Thor: Ragnarok, the best Thor so far with a major crossover appearance by one of Marvel's most popular characters, the Hulk. One of our biggest success stories in 2016 came from Parks and Resorts with the opening of Shanghai Disneyland. The park recently proved to be enormously popular with guests celebrating the Chinese New Year, operating at maximum capacity for virtually the entire holiday period. With the year's two peak seasons now behind us, we have welcomed more than 7 million guests to-date. We're thrilled with this performance and could potentially exceed 10 million in total attendance by the resort's first anniversary. The park's rapidly growing popularity, its extremely high levels of guest satisfaction, and the huge attendance during Chinese New Year add to our confidence in the resort's ability to reach breakeven in this fiscal year. In our domestic parks, this year we'll open a great addition to Disney's Animal Kingdom with a brand new land called Pandora \u2013 The World of Avatar. Our imagineers have brought the breathtaking world of Pandora to life through astonishing feats of artistic genius and groundbreaking engineering. The result is an exquisite environment with phenomenal attractions. And today I'm happy to announce this incredible new world will officially open on May 27. Additionally, our progress continues on Star Wars Lands at Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World, both of which will open in calendar 2019. Turning to Media Networks, we continue to address a dynamic evolving media environment. We're certainly well aware of the attention paid to ESPN and we're pleased with our implementation of strategies aimed at further strengthening ESPN's position and expanding its growth opportunities. As outlined in our last call, these include launching ESPN on all new multi-channel services, including Sling TV, PlayStation Vue, DIRECTV NOW, and the soon to be launched Hulu. We're also continuing to invest in ESPN's industry-leading programming. And we're improving and growing ESPN's presence on mobile devices with new and compelling apps. We're also investing in technology platforms to enable direct to consumer products, and to that end, I spent time with the team at BAMTech recently. And I'm very impressed and excited about the various initiatives being implemented to grow that business and to leverage its capabilities for our Media businesses. Great content will continue to drive opportunities and growth in this changing environment. And given our incredible portfolio of high-quality, in-demand branded content, we're extremely well positioned to strategically and successfully navigate the dynamic marketplace and generate value for our consumers and our shareholders over the long term. I'm going to let Christine take you through the details of the quarter. And then we'll be happy to take your questions. Christine?\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 were $1.55, which when adjusted for items affecting comparability represents a decline of only 5% compared to Q1 last year. I'll remind you last year's first quarter was the best quarter in the company's history. The year-over-year decline in earnings per share reflects this difficult comparison especially in our Studio and Consumer Products businesses due to the strength of Star Wars and, to a lesser extent, Frozen during the first quarter last year. Parks and Resorts had another strong quarter with 6% revenue growth and operating income growth of 13%, driven by increases and our domestic and international businesses. Results in the quarter include unfavorable impacts totaling about $70 million due to Hurricane Matthew, which disrupted operations at Walt Disney World and resulted in the closure of our parks for about a day and half. And the impact of one week of the winter holiday period falling in Q2 this year, whereas the entire holiday period fell in Q1 last year. We estimate these two items had an adverse impact on the year-over-year growth in operating income of about 7 percentage points. Growth at our domestic operations was driven primarily by higher guest spending across our businesses, partially offset by lower attendance. Attendance at our domestic parks was down 5% in the quarter, reflecting a number of comparability factors: last year's 60th Anniversary celebration at Disneyland Resort, the impact of Hurricane Matthew, and the shift in timing of the winter holiday. We estimate these factors had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in attendance of about 4 percentage points. We continued to see very healthy spending at our domestic parks. Per capita spending was up 7% on higher admissions and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 3%, and occupancy was down modestly to 91%. So far this quarter domestic resort reservations are comparable to prior-year levels, while booked rates are up 2%. Growth at our international parks was due to the opening of Shanghai Disney Resort in Q3 of fiscal 2016 and improved results at both Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland. Shanghai Disney Resort is off to a strong start. We continue to make great progress and, as Bob discussed, we are very encouraged by what we're seeing there so far. We feel great about the performance of our Parks business during the first quarter. Segment operating margin was 24.4%, up 150 basis points over last year, and represents the highest margin for this segment since we began consolidating our international parks in 2004 and that's despite an estimated 100 basis point headwind due to the impact of Hurricane Matthew and the timing of the winter holiday. At Media Networks, operating income was down 4% in the quarter as growth in Broadcasting was more than offset by decline in Cable. Lower Cable results were driven by a decline at ESPN where higher affiliate revenue was more than offset by an increase in programming and production expenses and a decrease in advertising revenue. Growth in ESPN's programming costs was due to our new NBA agreement and contractual rate increases for NFL programming, partially offset by lower programming costs for College Football due to the timing of the College Football Playoff relative to our fiscal calendar. As you know, this year, ESPN aired only three of the New Year's Six bowl games during the first quarter, whereas it aired all Six games during the first quarter last year. ESPN's ad revenue was down 7% in the quarter. The majority of the decline was due to the shift of the three bowl games out of Q1. So far this quarter, ESPN's ad sales are pacing up compared to last year. At Broadcasting, growth in operating income reflected higher affiliation revenue and lower programming costs at the ABC network. First quarter ad revenue across our Broadcasting business was roughly comparable to last year as higher ad revenue at our own TV stations was offset by lower ad revenue at the ABC network, where higher pricing was more than offset by a decrease in impressions. Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC network is running over 25% above upfront levels. Total Media Networks' affiliate revenue was up 4% in the quarter due to growth at both Cable and Broadcasting, as growth in rates was partially offset by lower subscribers and foreign exchange. At Consumer Products and Interactive Media, as anticipated, operating income was down meaningfully in the first quarter, given the record-breaking quarter the segment delivered last year. The decline in operating income was driven by lower results at our merchandise licensing business, as sales of Rogue One, Finding Dory, and Moana merchandise were more than offset by very strong sales of Star Wars and Frozen merchandise in Q1 last year. The strength of Star Wars last year also created a tough comp in our games businesses during Q1, given the success of Star Wars: Battlefront last year and no comparable title this year. Our Studio had another outstanding quarter and continues to deliver on both financial and creative fronts. While operating income was lower in the first quarter compared to last year, keep in mind, Q1 fiscal 2016 was the best quarter ever for the Studio. And Q1 of fiscal 2017 was the second best quarter ever with $842 million in operating income. The decline in operating income was due to lower results in our home entertainment and theatrical businesses. Lower home entertainment results reflected strong catalog unit sales in Q1 last year, particularly the classic Star Wars titles and Frozen compared to Q1 this year. On the theatrical side, Q1 results benefited from the strong performance of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, but that was more than offset by the exceptional performance of Star Wars: The Force Awakens in the first quarter last year. During the first quarter, we repurchased about 15 million shares for about $1.5 billion. Fiscal year-to-date, we've repurchased 22.2 million shares for approximately $2.2 billion. And as we've mentioned previously, we intend to repurchase between $7 billion and $8 billion for the year. As we look to the second quarter, there are a couple of comparability items I want to highlight. At ESPN, the shift of the three College Football Playoff games into Q2 will drive an increase in ESPN's programming costs compared to Q2 last year. Additionally, ESPN's programming costs will continue to reflect the first year of its new NBA rights deal. In total, we estimate cable programming and production costs will be up about 16% in the second quarter. And that's in line with our expectation for an 8% increase for the full year. At Parks and Resorts, Q2 results will benefit from one week of the winter holiday shifting into the quarter. However, the timing of the Easter holiday will negatively impact Q2 results, as this holiday period will fall entirely in Q3 this year, whereas it fell in Q2 last year. We estimate these two shifts will have a net adverse impact of about $50 million to operating income. And at the Studio, while we are incredibly excited for the release of Beauty and the Beast, I want to remind everyone, it will be our only release in the quarter. So Studio results will once again face a tough comparison to a very strong second quarter last year, which benefited from the strength of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and the release of Zootopia. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter results and with the start of the fiscal year. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell for Q&A.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Company: Okay, Christine. Thanks a lot. Operator, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you. How should we think about the outlook for the Consumer Products business this year given what you know about the Studio slate or what we know about the Studio slate? I mean it looks very favorable from what we can see with the Princess character, Beauty and the Beast and Cars and Spider-Man. I guess any other growth drivers such as higher royalty rates or additional international territories that you see as opportunities? Any color on that would be great.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Hi, Alexia. It's Christine. I think the best way look at Consumer Products is we had given you the outlook that they were going to be down for this first fiscal quarter, and they in fact were. But we expected them to have growth for the year, but most of that would be back end loaded. And that is the case. So you should expect growth year-over-year for the second half, both third quarter and fourth quarter. The properties that are really going to contribute to that are going to be Cars and Spider-Man, and we expect that to be a strong back half of the year for Consumer Products.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And just a bigger picture question I was going to ask on the Studio side, you've had such a stellar performance, obviously, so many home runs, particularly when some of your peers have had a bit of a slump. I guess with the slate ahead \u2013 I don't want to jinx it, it looks equally impressive. I guess what gives us the confidence that this is more reflective of the assets you own and the franchises you've invested in versus sort of just a positive sort of streak that you're going through?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Well, I think if you look at the record, Alexia, since we bought Pixar, which was a decade ago, we've made about 30 films under Pixar and Disney Animation because John Lasseter and Ed Catmull took over that, and then Marvel and then Star Wars or Lucasfilm. And those films have averaged about $900 million in global box office. So we're not \u2013 I'm sorry, about $800 million in global box office. So we don't think that there's a coincidence to this, and while obviously because we're dealing in a creative business there's risk associated. We think that we've done a really great job of de-risking the business. Then that's a combination of the franchises we have and obviously the stories that we're mining, but also the talent that we have at the company or that we are attracting to the company to make those films. And we have a lot of visibility into the early part of the next decade of the film slate. And we feel great about the projects that have been chosen and the progress that has been made on them.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Company: Thanks, Alexia. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Thanks. I have two. First, Bob, and then Christine. Bob, I wonder if you could comment on a story that was in the Journal yesterday that you may extend your contract past 2018.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: What's the second question? All right I'll take \u2013 before you ask the second one.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Thank you.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: When I targeted 2018 as the year that I was going to leave the company, it was a very personal decision. But I think as you know, I've been with this company for 43 years, and I've actually been CEO for almost a dozen years. And I'm going to do what's in the best interest of this company, which is something the board's clearly going to help determine. And while I'm confident that my successor is going to be chosen on a timely basis and chosen well, if it's in the best interest of the company for me to extend my term, I'm open to that. But there's nothing specific to announce at this point. We have a good, strong succession process underway. The board's engaged in this, as I've said before, on a regular basis. And the absence of any announcements or specifics about it should in no way indicate otherwise.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Okay. Thanks, Bob. And then for Christine, in the press release it said the Parks and Resorts costs were flat in quarter, and it looks like there were some cost initiatives. Can you tell us what you guys have done to control costs in the Parks? And how sustainable is low-single-digit cost inflation this year?\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Yeah. The Parks, as you saw the margin, in my comments, 24.4% operating margin. That's not only for the domestic operations, but that's for the global segment. So they've done a really good job on many fronts. And very importantly is their cost control. That's been through ongoing cost initiatives throughout their businesses. And they've offset the normal increases that we would get through inflation and wage increases. So I think you can expect continued cost management in the Parks and continued strong margins.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Okay. Thanks.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Company: Michael, thank you. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Oh. Thanks. Two questions. One, the press release states that Hulu results were in line with a year ago. Can you discuss the ramp into its launch? And I guess overall expectations for this and other over-the-top services? And as part of that, Bob, I remember you saying that you were bullish on ESPN's outlook for subs in the last call. Is that because of new services or due to better penetration by distributors like Comcast X1?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: First of all, on Hulu, as you know they've announced they're going to launch an over-the-top MVPD service. They have not been specific about a date. It's in, I think, private beta and will go into I guess more broad beta relatively soon. They've negotiated deals with a variety of different program or channel owners. And so far in terms of what we've seen of the product, we're encouraged by it in terms of its user interface and actually have a lot of faith in it from a technological perspective as well. To the second part of the question, my confidence in ESPN is due to a number of things, but clearly the deals that we have done with new platform owners, mostly over-the-top, have already yielded some nice gains from those services in subs, but they're not right now being counted fully by Nielsen. We've also done a deal with Hulu. And we have done a deal with another entity that has not been announced, and we're in discussions with others. So it seems like we're on the cusp of some significant growth for new entrants in the multi-channel marketplace. And what we like about them is they are mobile friendly or mobile first, their user interfaces tend to be very strong, and their pricing is priced substantially lower than the expanded basic bundle that most of the MVPDs are offering. And that obviously we think gives us a chance to both attract consumers that may not sign-up for multi-channel service or hold consumers into multi-channel subscriptions. And then lastly, what's really important is the deals that we've negotiated for distribution, particularly for ESPN, are to be in all subs or all households launched. And so these are light packages that offer us 100% penetration from those packages. And so we think that this wave that we're seeing is really a signal of what is to come and what the future will be. And the other thing I think is really good about this is that if we end up with a world where the $40 to $50 a month package becomes more and more popular, that means that some consumers may obviously take the savings that they may have from that and spend it on other things or save it. It also could mean they spend it on other video services and some of those services are services that we might offer. When we talk about going with our own direct-to-consumer product, it is possible that the first product that goes into the marketplace will be in effect add-on or adjunct product that consumers can buy on top of what is their normal multi-channel package. So if the multi-channel package is less expensive, consumers, you could argue, could have more spendable income or more money to spend on other video services, whether it's Netflix, whether it's Hulu, or whether it's other Disney-owned products that we're selling direct to the consumer. I also want to say one other thing, Jessica. I mentioned it in my remarks, but I was at BAMTech a couple of weeks ago and the quality of that technology has just blown us away and the potential that we believe that has for us is enormous. As you know, we've invested so that we own a third, we have a path to control, we are extremely excited about the prospects of what BAM is going to be doing near-term. We will be launching a direct-to-consumer sports service sometime in probably calendar 2017, but we're also very excited about what the potential of this is long-term, both for the company and for third-parties who can use the product because the technological side of it is so strong in ways that are value enhancing for them as well.\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Can you just address the advertising implications? Because you have so much direct-to-consumer and so much data on the users.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Well, one of the things that impressed me a lot from the BAMTech meeting that I had is what the potential is for them to use data to increase or to generate great revenue from advertising, something that we don't have today in part because a lot of our distribution comes through third-parties so we don't get access to that information.\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Right. Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Company: Jessica, thank you. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Benjamin Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon. Bob, last quarter you talked about both on the earnings call and I think at some conferences, digital distribution as a question mark and something that the company was thinking about strategically. You had DisneyLife in the market in a few regions. You made the BAMTech investment. But how are you thinking about the distribution side of the business strategically? Do you think there is acquisitions you need to make to get ESPN where it needs to be or \u2013 and ABC long-term? Do you find just watching the market evolve and make your move from there? Any updated thoughts on how you're thinking about the M&A landscape and distribution assets? And then I'll just sneak one in on the parks. From either you or Christine, any help in thinking about Avatar Land and sizing the opportunity? I'm trying to get a sense for how big of a needle mover that might be for the business when that opens in May.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: I'll take the second question, first, Ben. On Avatar Land, which, as I said earlier, will open on May 27. This is a very big land with an extremely unique design and architecture because it really does make you feel as though you're in Pandora, that great world that Jim Cameron created, and an E-ticket attraction that is unlike any E-ticket attraction that we've ever built. And it is sizable. The whole experience is sizable. And it is an add-on to Animal Kingdom, which has always been a good park but has never been a full-day experience. So we included or we added within the last year a nighttime Safari experience and some other entertainment. And by adding this, we're going to be turning what is our fourth gate, the last one to be opened in Orlando, into a much fuller experience and that gives it a lot of potential. It's also the biggest new land that we've opened in Florida in a very long time and I think that's good for the whole business down there. And to the extent that we can know this, we really believe that in the coming years, that the interest in Avatar is only going to grow as those movies enter the marketplace. And so we can't quantify it, but we think this is big potential. The first question, we don't really believe we need to make any acquisitions to accomplish what we need to do on the digital side. In reality, we believe that the best approach to doing well in a world that is disruptive, in a world that has far more digital distribution, is to have great content and tell great stories. And that includes ESPN, by the way. So if anything, I think the most important thing for ESPN is to continue to support and nurture their program offerings. Second to that, you have to be willing to either create or experience some disruption as we migrate from what has been a more traditionally distributed world to a more modern or more non-traditional distribution world. And some of that we're going to end up doing to ourselves, meaning we understand that there is disruption, but we believe we have to be a disruptor, too. And the investment in BAM, which is significant from a variety of different perspectives, is aimed at doing just that. And we have to be careful because we have existing agreements and existing relationships and a lot of value still being reaped from the traditional distribution relationships. But I can tell you that it is our full intent to go out there aggressively with digital offerings direct to the consumer for ESPN and other Disney-branded properties.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Helpful. Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Company: Thank you, Ben. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Please go ahead.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Anthony?\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet: Yeah, I'm here. Sorry.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet: Thanks for taking my questions and good afternoon. So just to keep the ball rolling on the BAMTech meeting, Bob, just curious what came out of that meeting in terms of specific sports content that would be included in it. I mean, you previously mentioned you had a lot of digital rights already. Do you still think it's not necessary to go out and acquire incremental digital rights for it? And then just kind of following on to Ben's question, once it launches, do you think it would make sense for you to go and partner with a big Internet platform in order to help distribute that product? And if I may, one for Christine, please, just, Christine, on the quarter, what was the underlying affiliate fee growth rate for the Cable Networks segment? And then also, you mentioned the timing shifts of the College Football games in the quarter for the Cable net segment, what was the underlying ad growth or decline if you normalize out those timing shifts in the quarter? Thank you.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Wow. Okay, multi-pronged question. BAMTech has already licensed a number of digital rights to sporting events, and we have licensed at ESPN a number of them. So we bring to the table a fair amount of rights that can be added to the rights that they have. And we're a minority shareholder right now, so I want to be careful, but our strong sense is as partners and as part owners is that we're going to continue to go out on behalf of the entity and license more content to that entity. But they're going to start off with, I think, a wide array of pretty attractive sports that come from both what they've licensed and what we've licensed. When you see it all together and some of the early, I'll call it, concepts, you realize that there's a lot there and a lot more than anyone else has. So I actually \u2013 and I think that there will be continued opportunities. In terms of distribution, do they need to enter into an agreement with a third-party entrant? I'll leave that to BAM ultimately to address, maybe at a time that they are ready to launch the product. I don't think it would be appropriate for me to speak on their behalf.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet: Okay.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Anthony, on your drivers of the affiliate revenue in the quarter, as I said in my comments, the affiliate revenue growth was 4%. That was \u2013 rates impacted it by 7%. Subs were a two-point drag, and FX was a one point drag. And that's for Media Networks overall. And these trends are consistent with the trends that we've had in recent quarters, so it's really no change. On advertising, as it relates ESPN, the ad revenue was down 7% in the quarter. The biggest driver of that was the shift in the College Football Playoff games three into 2Q. You also had some ratings decline in SportsCenter, and that was in part due to fewer programming hours for SportsCenter. And also when talked about this last conference call for earnings was declines in Monday Night Football ratings. But when you look at 2Q pacings, they're up even when you adjust for the College Football Playoff, which did have the most significant impact in 1Q.\nAnthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Company: Thank you, Anthony. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nTodd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks. I'll try to keep it for one for Bob and, one, Christine. Bob, would love your current thoughts on the business of kids television. I know there's lots of different ways to count audiences. It looks to us like conventionally defined audiences on your linear kids networks are down pretty significantly over multiple years. You're not alone in that; it seems true for most kids networks. I just wonder as you process that and especially thinking about direct-to-consumer offerings, what that \u2013 what you take from that in terms of thinking about that business and how that looks in the future. And then, Christine, just a quick one for you. Caught our eye \u2013 believe it or not, it looked like there was maybe an extra $1 billion or so cash contribution to fund the pension. So it caused me to think, it was probably worthwhile asking you in a rising rate environment a couple things. Like how that might affect the pension expense that rolls through the parks and its impact on margins? And how it might affect cash contributions? And if there's anything else we need to think about that after seeing that $1 billion number. Thanks.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Todd, first question on kids programming, you're right, we've seen a decline ratings-wise in kids viewing overall on linear channels. I don't want to speak for the industry, but I'll speak for Disney. And I think that's the result of a couple of things. One, I'll call it a bit of an off cycle in terms of programming; and two, a proliferation of kids programming in a variety of other places. To the first part of the answer, we have just debuted a show called Mickey Mouse Roadster Racers (sic) [Mickey and the Roadster Racers] (36:01) that's done extremely well. We have a Tangled series that's hitting soon and a lot of \u2013 and a product cycle over the next year to two years that we feel great about. And so we think that the ratings are likely to improve with the addition of some new shows that we think creatively are very strong. In addition to that, I think we stand a chance of doing really well no matter what the environment is from a disruption perspective because of that name, Disney, and what it means to the consumer. And I think that will result in a couple of things: greater demand for \u2013 to license our product on other direct-to-consumer platforms: Hulu, Netflix, examples of that. And also the possibility of us taking Disney-branded television programming direct to the consumer. That's what we're doing in the U.K. with DisneyLife. It's a combination of movies, television programming, and then other Disney properties like digital books and music, for instance. We're still in, what I'll call, an experimental stage, because we've been learning more and more about technology platform, churn rates, pricing, those sorts of things. But we do know that we have a brand and the product behind it to be able to take it direct-to-consumer. So I think as we look at the future of our kids programming, we look at it in all likelihood as probably a blend of linear channels, some third-party licensing arrangements and also direct-to-consumer properties. And this is not just for the United States. I had an interesting meeting with our country manager in India recently, where we own a number of channels. And he was talking about the opportunities there from Netflix and Amazon and discussing the possibility of licensing more to them. And the other thing, by the way, you have to think about is some of that licensing doesn't have to be off network. It could be original programming as we've done with Netflix and Marvel. So the demand for Disney is huge from the consumer perspective and from a distribution perspective. And again we're seeing I think a world where disruption is definitely on the table and real. But it's not something that we feel is daunting in terms of the task ahead.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: So, Todd, to answer your question on pension. As you saw the first page of our press release in the first table we showed cash from operations. You saw it down pretty significantly from a year ago. But if you account for that, if you adjust for the $1.3 billion of pension contribution that we made in the quarter, it more than offsets that decline. You mentioned rising rates. And rising rates will definitely benefit our pension going forward. In our 10-Q we \u2013 I believe the 10-Q had explicitly stated that for each 100 basis point increase in the discount rate, our pension liability would decrease by about $2.4 billion. So that being said, rising rates are certainly going to benefit us. As it relates to pension expense for the year, we don't expect to change from what we had talked about in our last conference call. And after this $1.3 billion that we put in, in the first quarter, there shouldn't be any meaningful contributions for the balance of the year.\nTodd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks, guys. Fantastic.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Company: Okay, Todd. Thank you. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Janedis from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJohn Janedis - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Thank you. Maybe another quick follow up at the parks. I think you've increased ticket prices in February the last couple of years. You're going to lap the demand-based pricing model in a couple of weeks. And with Pandora opening, is there maybe a near-term opportunity to further increase single or multi-day ticket prices?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Yes. I have nothing to announce at this point, but we do take ticket pricing up on typically an annual basis and we do so in a variety of different ways. Sometimes it's redesign of packages. Remember that in Florida that most of our attendance is multi-day in nature, and so the single day including when we take pricing increases is less important than when we take single-day pricing up in California. But we're not prepared to make any specific comments about what's in store in that regard.\nJohn Janedis - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thanks. Maybe separately, I thought it was interesting that units delivered were up at ESPN and down at ABC. There has clearly been a lot of discussion around inventory across the industry. So as you look at your strategy this year, is there a flex to add units at ESPN if some of the programming or ratings are soft? And is there a concerted effort to reduce units at ABC?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: I think that the ABC \u2013 on the ABC side, the reason there weren't as many units sold is that they were using units for audience efficiencies or make goods. I think that, in general, there's probably too much commercial interruption in television. It's a subject that has been discussed both on the ESPN front and on the ABC front and it's something we're going to continue to look at, particularly when you've got entrants in the marketplace that are offering programming that are not commercially interrupted.\nJohn Janedis - Jefferies LLC: Thanks, Bob.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Company: Okay. John, thanks. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi. Please go ahead.\nJason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I just had one question for Mr. Iger. As it relates to BAMTech, as a minority holder, you've got baseball that owns a stake and also the hockey league, NHL, as a minority holder as well. Can you just spend a minute and talk about the strategic implication of having leagues have an equity stake in that entity with you?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Well, I think it's obvious in the sense that the equity position, particularly the one you cited, the hockey position, came with an agreement to license product to BAMTech. And so, while I don't necessarily believe that that means that the future will result in more owners coming in, although again, I don't want to speak for BAM, I guess that could potentially be on the table, I do want to say, though, that our agreement with BAM to take the stake that we took does give us a path to control, and where it's premature for us to discuss whether we'll exercise that right or not, but I should say that if we were to exercise that right when we can, it's still quite possible that there will be minority shareholders if that is in a way a quid pro quo to having access to their content. That makes sense?\nJason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: It does. It does.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay.\nJason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Can I just ask a follow up? It seems like at some level it fundamentally changes your relationship, though, with the leagues in that in the past you would buy sports rights and then resell them to the pay-TV distributors and now it seems like your equity incentives are more aligned in a way. Is that (43:09)?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Well, I think there's a yes and no to that. I think it will be both. We don't see ourselves getting out of, what I'll call, the linear ESPN multi-channel service for a while. We do see ourselves, I mentioned, adding, through BAMTech, a direct-to-consumer proposition that will, in all likelihood, include a lot of sports and sports from some entities that we license content from for ESPN. Baseball is actually one example of that. I don't think it fundamentally changes the relationship. I guess it's in a way it creates a different form of partnership but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.\nJason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: No, no. I think it's a good thing. Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Company: All right, Jason. Thank you. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Miller from Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDavid W. Miller - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Yeah, hey, Bob, just another quick question on the ESPN direct-to-consumer offering using the BAMTech technology. I would assume that you guys will probably have this out by maybe like July or August or so, so any kind of hint on timing would be great. And then how do you see pricing this? Do you see pricing it like CBS All Access and doing what they have done or do you see perhaps pricing it lower than that and taking sort of a Starbucks point of pricing it low and then getting people hooked into it and then raising the price later? Any thoughts on pricing would be helpful. Thanks so much.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Well, first of all, I am hooked on Starbucks, by the way. So maybe, I guess, I have fallen prey to that strategy. I just can't comment about pricing. It has been discussed with BAM, but I really can't comment about that. Nor can I comment about the specifics in terms of the time of launch except to say that the goal is to launch the program \u2013 I'm sorry \u2013 the platform sometime in 2017.\nDavid W. Miller - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And then, Christine, if I could just sneak one in. I apologize, my audio faded out. Did you happen to say in your prepared remarks where ABC scatter stands at this time in terms of scatter spreads relative to upfront? Thanks a lot.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Yeah, quarter-to-date scatter pricing is over 25% above upfront.\nDavid W. Miller - Loop Capital Markets LLC: Wonderful. Okay, thank you so much.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Company: Thank you, David. Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Okay. And our last question comes from Bryan Kraft from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thank you. I had a question on the parks. I think, Christine, you said attendance was down 1% excluding the one-timers and the timing factors. And I just want to ask, is this would you say weaker demand or is there something else at play here and as we think about the normal attendance levels going forward, should we think about those as being flattish except for, of course, the timing of holiday periods? And then I also just wanted to ask about use of cash. Under operating activities, there was a large use of cash in accounts payable and other liabilities. I just want to see if you could help us understand what was driving that. I don't know if that was partly the pension contribution. Thank you.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay. On the parks, as you noted, we did have a lot of comparability factors and once again there is a lapping of the 60th, the Hurricane Matthew, and also the impact of the shift of holiday periods. We also, as was noted previously in the call, we did introduce seasonal pricing a year ago and we are seeing some shift in some of our demand to try to smooth attendance over those peak demand periods. So I don't think you should read too much into the attendance. Over the same period that you're noting, we've also seen strong increases in per cap spending. It was up 7% in the quarter, which we gave you. And so that's more than offset the impact of the attendance decline. And we also have some new offerings, as Bob mentioned, Avatar, there's also Guardians of the Galaxy coming this summer at Disneyland Resort in Anaheim. So we think these new offerings are going to stimulate future demand and I don't think you should read too much into this one quarter. On the change in payables, that decline is related to the pension plan contribution of $1.3 billion.\nBryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay?\nBryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for your help.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Company: Thank you, Bryan, and thanks again, everyone, for joining us today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Good afternoon and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and a transcript will be available on our website. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob will lead off followed by Christine and then we'll be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Lowell. Good afternoon everyone. We're pleased with our results in Q4, delivering a strong finish to fiscal 2018. Adjusted for comparability, earnings per share were up 38% for the quarter and 24% for the year. Christine will give you details about our performance in a few minutes. My remarks are focused on two of our biggest priorities in fiscal 2019. The successful completion and integration of our 21st Century Fox acquisition and the further development of our DTC business, which includes adding new content and subscribers to ESPN+, gaining majority stake in Hulu and launching our highly anticipated Disney-branded service late next year. With regard to our acquisition of 21st Century Fox, we just received EU regulatory approval this week, another major milestone in the process. And we're optimistic about securing the necessary approvals from the territories that remain. Last June, we estimated it could take up to 12 months for the transaction to close. But we are increasingly optimistic it will be meaningfully earlier than that. As I have said numerous times, the value of the portfolio of recognized brands and world-class content we're acquiring is impressive, as is the wealth of executive talent at 21st Century Fox, many of whom will hold key positions in the combined company. Upon completion of the acquisition, Peter Rice will be Chairman of Walt Disney Television, reporting to me, and will also serve as Co-Chair of our Media Networks Group along with ESPN President Jimmy Pitaro. Dana Walden, John Landgraf and Gary Knell will also be joining us in leadership roles, reporting to Peter. Additionally, a number of 21st Century Fox studio executives will be joining Alan Horn's team at Disney's Studio Entertainment, including Emma Watts at Twentieth Century Fox, Nancy Utley and Steve Gilula at Fox Searchlight and Elizabeth Gabler at Fox 2000. As I mentioned earlier, DTC continues to be one of our top priorities. Our strategic purchase of BAMTech allowed us to enter this arena quickly and effectively, as evidenced by our successful launch of ESPN+ six months ago. More than 1 million users have already subscribed. And we continue to see impressive growth. Sports fans are attracted to an ever-growing number of live events, including Top Rank Boxing, Major League Baseball, the NHL, MLS and Italy's Serie A soccer, along with thousands of college sports events, including 200 college football games this season, along with more than 2,900 college basketball match ups, including almost 550 in November alone. We'll add UFC to the ESPN+ lineup starting in January. The platform also features exclusive original content, including the groundbreaking series, Detail offering Kobe Bryant's insight into the NBA. And as you may have seen, Peyton Manning is now writing and hosting an NFL version. The early growth trajectory of ESPN+ is very encouraging. And we believe it bodes very well for our overall global DTC strategy. Our Disney-branded service, which we're officially calling Disney+, will be in the U.S. market late next year, offering a rich array of original Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic content, along with unprecedented access to our incredible library of film and television content, including all of our new theatrical releases starting with the 2019 slate. We've already announced the robust pipeline of Disney+ original content currently in production, including The Mandalorian, the world's first live action Star Wars series written and produced by Jon Favreau. As you know, John launched the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Iron Man. He also redefined live action story-telling in Jungle Book and he's doing it again with Lion King. So we're thrilled to have him creating content for this new platform. In addition to putting together a great story and strong cast, Jon's got an unbelievable collection of talent behind the camera, including Taika Waititi, the Director of Thor: Ragnarok. Over a decade ago, Disney Channel's High School Musical was a real success. And we're building on that success and reimagining the franchise for a new generation with a live-action Disney+ series. Animation will also be an integral part of Disney+. The service will be the exclusive home of the next season of the popular Star Wars animated series Clone Wars as well as a new series based on Pixar's beloved Monsters, Inc. franchise. The Disney+ platform is also a perfect home for documentary series that will allow us to pull the curtain back and give people a behind-the-scenes perspective. We've got several docuseries currently in production, including an exclusive unprecedented look at Walt Disney Imagineering, featuring stories we've never really told before and images we've never shared. Our studios are also creating a robust slate of original films exclusively for Disney+, including Noelle starring Anna Kendrick as Santa's daughter, a live-action version of Lady and the Tramp, and Togo, an adventure starring three-time Oscar nominee, Willem Dafoe. We're also currently developing a live-action Marvel series about Loki starring Tom Hiddleston, playing the character he's made so famous. And we're working on a second live action Star Wars series, a prequel to Rogue One, starring Diego Luna. As with ESPN+, the launch of Disney+ will just be the starting point. We plan to continually elevate the experience, and enhance the value to consumers with a constant pipeline of exclusive new content as we move forward. I visited BAMTech last week and saw an early prototype of the app which will feature elegant navigation, personalization and content, segmented primarily by our core brands namely Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and the soon to be added National Geographic. It will blend library product with original content under these five brand banners and we are confident it will be a compelling consumer proposition. We're planning an investor conference in April to provide more insight into our DTC strategy including a first look at Disney+ along with some of the content we're creating for it. I'm now going to turn the call over to Christine to talk about our Q4 performance, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Christine?\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.48, an increase of 38% over the prior year. We delivered another strong quarter of financial results driven by Studio Entertainment and Parks and Resorts, which also were significant contributors to the 24% growth in adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2018. It was a very active year for the company on a number of fronts and these financial results demonstrate a continued focus on execution of our strategy while we invest to position the company for long-term growth. Our Studio had another great quarter and a phenomenal fiscal year. Higher Studio results for the fourth quarter were primarily due to growth in operating income from our worldwide theatrical business and to a lesser extent lower film impairments and growth in TV/SVOD distribution and home entertainment. Higher worldwide theatrical results reflect the strong performance of Incredibles 2 and Ant-Man and the Wasp compared to Cars 3 and no Marvel title in the fourth quarter last year. For the year, the Studio generated a record $3 billion in operating income surpassing the Studio's previous record of $2.7 billion set in fiscal 2016. Our Studio results demonstrate once again that our relentless focus on quality, creative excellence and compelling storytelling can lead to consistently strong financial results. At Parks and Resorts, operating income growth was driven by higher results at our domestic operations, which reflected a $100 million adverse impact of Hurricane Irma during the fourth quarter last year. Higher operating income at our domestic operations was primarily due to guest spending and attendance growth, partially offset by higher cost including roughly $55 million related to a special cast member bonus we announced earlier in the year. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 4% and per capita spending was up 9% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 8% and occupancy was up one percentage point to 85%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 3% compared to prior year, while booked rates are up 4%. Results at our international operations were comparable to the fourth quarter last year. Total segment operating income margin was up 40 basis points compared to Q4 last year. Turning to Media Networks, operating income was higher in the fourth quarter as growth in broadcasting more than offset a decline at cable and lower equity income. Total Media Networks affiliate revenues was up 5% in the quarter as a result of growth at both Cable and broadcasting. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by seven points of growth due to higher rates partially offset by approximately a one-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers and a one point impact from foreign exchange. The improving sub-trends continued in the fourth quarter so we now have five consecutive quarters of improvement in the rate of net subscriber declines. Broadcasting operating income was up meaningfully in the fourth quarter due to higher program sales and growth in affiliate revenue. The increase in program sales was primarily due to the sale of two Marvel series versus one last year and a sale of Black-ish in the quarter. Higher affiliate revenue was driven by contractual rate increases. Advertising revenue at broadcasting was comparable to the fourth quarter last year as higher network rate and higher political advertising at our TV stations were offset by lower network impressions. Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running about 35% above upfront levels. Q4 results were low in the quarter as higher operating income at Disney Channel Worldwide and Freeform, were more than offset by losses at BAMTech which are consolidated in our Cable results due to our acquisition of a controlling interest in September of last year. BAMTech's fourth quarter results this year reflect content and marketing costs and ongoing investment in its technology platform. At ESPN, operating income in the quarter was comparable to Q4 last year as growth in affiliate revenue was offset primarily by higher programming costs and lower advertising revenue. The increase in programming expense was driven by contractual rate increases for NFL and college sports programming. Ad revenue at ESPN was down 6% in the quarter due to a decrease in average viewership and lower units delivered. So far this quarter, ESPN's cash ad sales are pacing up compared to prior year and reflect in part a shift in the timing of the college football semifinals. ESPN will once again air three of the New Year six ball games during the first quarter. However this year, two of those ballgames will be semifinal games, which aired during the second fiscal quarter last year. Equity income was lower in the quarter as a result of higher losses at Hulu and lower income from our investment in A&E, partially offset by the absence of equity losses at BAMTech. The higher losses at Hulu were primarily driven by higher programming, marketing and labor cost partially offset by higher subscription and advertising revenue. At Consumer Products & Interactive Media, segment operating income was lower in the quarter due to asset impairments which were driven by the write-down of retail store leasehold improvements and lower licensing income, partially offset by lower costs primarily in our games business. Given the pending acquisitions of 21st Century Fox, we did not purchase our stock during the fourth quarter. We repurchased a total of 34.6 million shares for $3.6 billion for fiscal 2018. Now, I would like to discuss some matters pertaining to fiscal 2019. First, as we previously announced, at the end of Q1, we will begin reporting our financial results under a new structure made up of four business segments: Media Networks, Park Experiences and Consumer Products, Studio Entertainment and Direct-To-Consumer and International. In early January, we expect to file three years of restated financials that will reflect this new segment reporting structure. Second, as Bob mentioned, we plan to host an Investor Day in April, during which we will discuss our direct-to-consumer businesses in more detail as well as provide additional perspective on our company post the 21st Century Fox acquisition assuming the transaction will have closed by then. And of course, we will webcast that event. While our full year fiscal 2019 results will be influenced by the timing of the closing of the Fox acquisition, I want to highlight some items we already know will affect year-over-year comparability. We are extremely enthusiastic about our 2019 slate, which include Ralph Breaks the Internet, Mary Poppins Returns, Captain Marvel, Dumbo, the next Avengers films, Aladdin, Toy Story 4 and The Lion King. I'll remind you that 2018 was the best year in our studio's history. We face a particularly challenging comp in the first quarter due to the phenomenal success of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Thor: Ragnarok and Coco. Given the significant contributions these films made to operating income in Q1 last year, operating income from our theatrical business in Q1 this year could be down as much as $600 million versus 2018. The theatrical success of Star Wars: The Last Jedi also resulted in higher licensing results for the first quarter last year, though the absence of a comparable franchise title this year will weigh on our licensing business in Q1. For the full year, we expect cable programming expenses to be up mid-single digit, driven primarily by contractual rate increases for sports rights at ESPN. However, we expect Q1 cable programming expenses to be up 9%, driven by the timing shift of the college football semifinals I mentioned earlier. We will continue to invest in both ESPN+ and our yet-to-be launched Disney+ service. The continued ramp up of ESPN+, which includes investments in sports rights, will have an adverse impact on operating income of about $100 million for the first quarter. We'll have more to say about our overall direct-to-consumer strategy and the aggregate full year financial implications during the Investor Day in April. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell, and we'd be more than happy to take your questions.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay, Christine. Thank you. And, operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Bob, I want to ask you about both Disney+ and Hulu, if I could. Hulu has been around for a while. It's had this ownership structure that's obviously had multiple partners in place. So we've never seen Hulu run by a single controlling shareholder. And I'm just wondering if you could talk about your vision for that product and that business, post the close of the deal. I know you've got this Investor Day coming. But whatever you're comfortable sharing with us today would be helpful, because that's a business that does have some reasonable scale, but does lose money and has multiple products. And I wonder if you could fit it into your overall worldview. And then on the Disney+ service, have you guys thought about the theatrical window around pay one? I mean one of the things that seems like an interesting opportunity would be shortening that window and actually bringing films from theatrical release into the Disney+ experience earlier than the usual seven or eight months window. So I'm wondering if you've thought about that opportunity or at least the overall theatrical strategy for Disney+. Anything you can share there would be great.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Well, first of all regarding Hulu, as you noted, we'll own 60%, which will give us considerable say in how Hulu is run. But there will be two other partners, unless they decide to divest their interest, namely Comcast and AT&T Time Warner. So anything we do with Hulu will be done with an eye toward being fiscally responsible to the other shareholders, even though they're minority shareholders. That said, we think that given the success of Hulu so far in terms of subscriber growth and the relative brand strength and other things too like demographics, we think there's an opportunity to increase investment in Hulu notably on the programming side. And with this acquisition comes not only some great IP, but some excellent talent, particularly on the television side \u2013 well, there is talent in both movies and TV. And we aim to use the television production capabilities of the combined company to fuel Hulu with a lot more original programming, original programming that we feel will enable Hulu to compete even more aggressively in the marketplace. I also think Hulu is attractive in many ways. And one I mentioned, demographics. If you look at the demographics of the people consuming off-network shows in Hulu, and you look at the demographics of the same shows on the network, you'll see what could be at times 20 years younger audience at Hulu. And that's clearly attractive to advertisers, which I think has been somewhat underappreciated about Hulu in that it is a very strong play for advertisers, because it can offer targeted ads. And it has great demos. And it's just a great user experience. The quality of the product, meaning the quality of the television programming is quite high. So overall, I think we've got an opportunity to invest more in Hulu, to grow its subs. I also think there's some pricing elasticity too, but notably on the multi-channel front. And we'll talk about sometime in the near future. And I think there's an opportunity to improve \u2013 or I should say increase our pricing there. And it will focus mostly by the way on what I'll call general entertainment programming. And we'll leave the more family-oriented programming to the Disney+ app. On the theatrical, the question you asked me about the theatrical window, sort of with us, if it ain't broke. I know you may think that there's an opportunity. But as noted by the results of our studio in fiscal 2018 and of course in the last quarter, we have a studio that is doing extremely well and a formula that is serving us really well in terms of its bottom line. And we're probably going to aim to protect that initial window. And then the other thing that's quite clear to us is that the home video window, as it's been called, that follows the theatrical window also continues to be quite important to us, both the sale of these films digitally as well as physical goods. And I think you'll likely see us protect that as well although there's going to be a discussion around whether there's an opportunity to move the product from that window to what I'll call, the pay one window maybe a little bit sooner, but we're not looking right now to encroach on the theatrical window.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay, Ben, thank you. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nMichael Brian Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Thanks, Bob. I have two for you. One, first on Hulu and then one for ESPN \u2013 sorry, on Sky. So, I'm not complaining that you didn't get Sky. I think we're all happy with that, but I wonder, by not getting Sky, what did you trade-off, and maybe the speed of timing to get Disney+ into the European markets? So what were the trade-offs that you saw by not getting in Sky? And how did that affect the Disney+ rollout? And then, on ESPN, as you know, over the past three years, we've focused on ESPN and subscriber losses and now you're trending the right way. What do you think is driving this improvement in subscriber trend? And I think you have half of your affiliate deals come due in the next year or so. Is any of this improvement coming at this point from the new deals you've done or is that to come as you sign more deals into 2019?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Well, on the second part of the question about ESPN, it's coming from new deals that we did, but with the digital MVPDs, and so we've seen some nice growth there, including by the way from Hulu. And I think that we're hopeful that the take-up of the digital MVPDs will continue to grow. Even though I know there's been a lot said about that, what I talked about earlier, I think it's \u2013 from a demographic perspective, these services tend to be very attractive for younger viewers. They are also less expensive, which I think is important, even though I think there might be an opportunity for us to take pricing up a bit at Hulu. And the user experience is great. So, we are bullish about the MVPDs. And with that in mind, we believe that ESPN will benefit nicely from that over the long term. Another thing by the way that is interesting is that there are some entities out there that have gone into the space, notably, YouTube, that are obviously quite committed to growing their service. Just look at the World Series and the amount of advertising that was in the World Series for the YouTube service, that suggests to us that we're not the only believer out there, that there are others as well. On the Sky front, you can't cry over spilled milk, so to speak. There's nothing we can do about it. We made a bid that we thought was an appropriate bid in terms of what we saw as value to our company. We would have loved to have had Sky, both because we believe in the asset and we thought it could have helped us in terms of introducing a direct-to-consumer service in the European market, but again, only at a price that made sense for us. Without Sky, we are still planning on taking Disney+ out in Europe. We also plan working with Hulu to introduce Hulu in more international markets as well. It could possibly be that it takes us a little bit longer to penetrate some of these markets, but we believe in the product that we will be launching and we'll make sure that that product is tailored for the various European markets, not just because it needs to satisfy all of the quotas for SVODs in Europe, but also because we think it needs to be locally relevant. And we're going to be selective in terms of the markets that we choose initially, but we believe we're going to win \u2013 we have a real opportunity there, particularly when it comes to the Disney-branded service, which is going to feature Marvel and Pixar and Star Wars and Disney, of course, and the National Geographic. Those are all very attractive brands in those markets and that's going to make that product extremely unique and in demand.\nMichael Brian Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Okay. Thanks, Bob.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Michael. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. I have two different topics. On Fox, can you talk a little bit about the integration on your plans? The film side almost seems easier because your labels are so specific, but TV is very interesting, because Fox is so strong. What will your goals are or hopes be over the next three years in terms of integration and how you can grow the Fox business with Disney's existing TV business? And then, completely separate topic on Shanghai, can you give us a little color on what's going on? I mean your press release said, attendance is up, but pricing is down. What's going on there and can you talk a little bit about your investment plans for that park? I know your plans are to grow it, but can you talk a little bit about the next few years?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Sure. I'll start with Shanghai, Jessica. Sometime over mid-late fiscal 2018, we saw some softness in the tourism market in China, not just \u2013 by the way, not just for us, but across the board, and we basically put in place some discounting, some lower pricing to continue to drive attendance during what we saw as somewhat of a downturn, but we didn't necessarily think it was permanent. We've subsequently taken a lot of those promotions or those price discounting off and the results actually have been good. But I think what we're seeing in China is maybe a slight reduction in consumer confidence and that's having an impact on the business somewhat, but we still believe very, very, very bullishly in not only the business that we've built, but the business that we can continue to invest in. We opened up a new land. Since we opened Shanghai this past year, we opened Toy Story Land and we have plans for continued expansion, both attractions and ultimately hotels, but we haven't made any specific announcements about that yet, but we still feel great about that market for our theme park business. And then, on the integration front, I think, if you look at our company's results over the last, I would say, let's say, five years, you've seen incredibly impressive results at Parks and Resorts and our Studio, businesses that not only are doing well, but we've continued to grow year, after year, after year. And if you look at our television business overall, obviously, ESPN has done well, but they've had some of the issues in terms of distribution or subs. The rest of our television businesses' performance has been relatively modest over that period of time. As we look at this acquisition, not only does it come with great IP, but the television business that we're buying is we think very, very attractive, not just in the United States but across the world. If you factor in Star in India and the rest of Asia, and you factor in Europe where they have a substantially greater footprint of channels than we do, which by the way may ultimately end up helping us with content and distribution when it comes to the direct-to-consumer business. What we also get is a great television studio that's been run by Dana Walden and others. And what we aim to do there is we aim to create in a combined entity a very, very successful television studio that will be aimed at creating product not only for the traditional businesses that we're in, namely the channels and the network, but also for our direct-to-consumer services. So there's a very, very important strategic play here in terms of what the studio and the people that will be running the studio can do. And then of course we bring \u2013 we've made these announcements. We bring Peter Rice in, we bring John Landgraf in. We're bringing in executives that not only have a lot of experience, but a lot of success under their belts on the television side and the ability to not only strengthen the existing Disney television businesses, but to create a television business that is basically designed to service both I'll call it the present as well as the future of the combined entity.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks Jessica. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you. Bob, looking at the successful launch of ESPN+ and how it's rolled out ahead of expectations, is there anything like that you learned specifically that you could share with us that perhaps influences your strategy on the Disney+ launch they had? And then just a follow-up on the domestic parks, how should we think about or frame the opening of the Star Wars Lands I think both in Anaheim and Orlando, when we think about drivers to the parks next year or next calendar year I should say? I'm assuming bigger than Pandora. Is it as big as Cars Land? Any color on that would be great. Thank you.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Well, on the Star Wars Lands, these are the biggest lands that we've ever built and in both cases not only are they big in size and scale, they're huge in ambition in terms of both the experience that we aim to create, meaning the immersive experience as well as the specific experiences people have in the attractions, namely in both cases, two very, very innovative and we believe compelling and exciting e-ticket attractions. And so we think that they're going to have a major impact and Disneyland clearly is the biggest thing that we've ever done at Disneyland since it opened in 1955. And we think it's going to drive huge increase in demand and we think we're going to have some interesting challenges on our hands to manage that demand, but that's a good problem to have. And then in Florida, we have four parks. Star Wars Land there is going into the Studios Park, Hollywood Studios Park where we opened Toy Story Land not that long ago and we've aimed to actually grow the attendance to that park, which has lagged a bit over the last number of years because we haven't invested anything that is this close to size or scale or compelling nature of it. So we think in both cases that it will have a dramatic impact positively on both businesses. On the first question about ESPN+, I think there are a few things you have to consider. First of all we've learned positive things. It clearly is working in terms of interest from users and subscriptions which continue to grow. From what we gather from the research we've seen and just generally anecdotal information, it's a product that is considered a good consumer experience, easy to navigate, easy to use and very high quality in terms of the quality of the live streaming. And we've put onto that product a fairly strong inventory of all kinds of different sporting events. And we've seen consumption that's actually quite interesting for things like MLS during the regular season, which is soccer. We've seen some nice uptake in some of the college football numbers. And we are putting on, by the way, just under 3,000 college basketball games in the next few months, 550 of them alone in the month of November. And then we put the UFC on, where the big UFC fight, biggest, first big one after the first of the year will be exclusive to the platform. And for the 30-some-odd UFC fight nights thereafter, 20 will be on and exclusive to this product. So I would say we're kind of just in the early innings, to use a sports analogy, of where we're going to be product-wise. And then we're also in the early innings in terms of where we're going to be from a feature set perspective. And last week I was in New York at BAMTech. And they gave me a great presentation on personalization and customization and the technology that they've \u2013 engine that they're creating to better serve the consumer in that regard. Because we know there's a huge opportunity there, given people's interests in very specific teams or specific sports or specific leagues or specific geographic territories. So I'd say what we've learned is quite positive, a product that is working. And it gives us reason to have great optimism as we add more content. And we will add more technology features. And then we haven't really even begun marketing it. Someone pointed out earlier, we talked about \u2013 actually it was Christine McCarthy. As we talk about putting more college sports on, the affinity that people have to the colleges that they've gone to is extraordinary. And we're just beginning a process to start marketing very specifically to alumni from different colleges, who may not be able to find sports from their college on what I'll call the national sports networks. But we're going to serve them well on this platform.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Alexia. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open.\nDouglas Mitchelson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thanks so much. I'm curious, Bob, what factors will influence when you would take Hulu or a Hulu-like service international, global. And on the BAMTech side, what else needs to be done, if anything, to be ready to launch the Disney service in a year? Obviously you're pleased so far with the execution that you built there. But I'm just curious if sort of everything's in the can and ready to go? Or where there's a lot of work left to do?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: I can't really say much yet about Hulu in terms of international markets, although we're just looking at basically a set of priorities in terms of how we're going to launch Disney. And then after the deal closes and after we have the 60% ownership, we'll meet with the Hulu management team and the board and discuss what the opportunities are in terms of both global growth and investing more in content. But that's something that we have to do after the deal closes. The second question, what needs to be done on the BAMTech side? Really very little in the sense that, I mean, there's a lot that needs to be done, but it's being done. I saw an iteration of the app last week. And I was very impressed with it. It's not quite in ready for prime time, because it's still being iterated, but it will be elegant, it will be very brand-centric, which will we believe add navigational features that typically don't exist in other platforms, namely that there'll be segments under the brand program, segments under the brands Disney, Pixar, Star Wars, Marvel and then National Geographic. So we think there'll be an elegance to it, an ease of use. And we're going to super serve the most ardent fans of those five different brands by creating experiences and environments that are more tailored or customized and personalized to those brands. We have obviously a very stable product when it comes to live streaming as I said earlier. That's been tested already on the sports front. We believe that our ability to both attract and ultimately retain consumers is strong from a technology perspective. And now obviously we have to aid that effort with programming. And I'd say right now, aside from the development that's being done at BAMTech on the app itself, mostly what's going on at the company on the Disney+ side is ramping up our production and continuing to commit to new product. We mentioned a few today on the call, a Marvel series specifically and another Star Wars series and a number of movies and docuseries. And there is activity across the board at our company in terms of increased production investment specifically for this app. And it'll take some time obviously to achieve the kind of scale we're going to need on a steady-state, because it takes time to make these products, particularly given the high production values that they will represent. But besides that, we think we're in great shape. We have a game plan in place to bring the product to market. And we hope to show you a fair amount about the app, the app itself and some of the programming and some of our strategies, including our pricing strategy when we have the investor meeting that we talked about having sometime in April on the call earlier.\nDouglas Mitchelson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks so much.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thank you, Doug. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Your line is open.\nKannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. So just a couple. First on the approval time line. Bob, I think you guys seem a lot more comfortable with the timeline being more in the first quarter instead of the first half. And obviously you've got approval in the EU earlier this week. Just wanted to understand what brought the timeline ahead? And secondly on ESPN+, is there an opportunity for the app to be an aggregator for content that you don't own? Is it a possibility for you to essentially create a bundle of content that others own and then have a revenue sharing kind of a model for that app? Thanks.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Our current plan on ESPN+ is to license and produce content that is basically solely owned and controlled by us, obviously on the license front in many cases from third parties, which is usually the case with sports rights. We think it would quickly get very complicated if we aggregated content that was really owned fully by other entities. And we think we have enough right now and we'll be able to continue to license more. On the timeline, when we first announced this deal in December of 2017 and then when we closed the deal again, where we made the deal later in the year, we talked about a timeline first that would be 12 to 18 months and then roughly, I think, we talked about 12 months from what was June. And since then, we gained approval in the United States, the U.S. Justice Department, and then this week with the EU. Those are two very significant markets. And for an acquisition of this size and this complexity, we assumed that it would take a certain amount of time for the regulatory authorities to consider all the various marketplace issues that they had to consider. And we are optimistic today, because we've been able to gain approval not only in those two but in multiple other markets and countries around the world. We still have a few important countries to go. We're well into those processes and based on what we know, we were able to say earlier on the call that we've gotten more optimistic about our ability to close much earlier than the June timeframe that we talked about. And I think it's just best to leave it at that because frankly we don't know specifically when it will be.\nKannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Kannan. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Cahall with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.\nSteven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks. Bob, I was wondering if you could update us a bit on what the strategy is for some of the rights that you currently license to some of your partners domestically. Do you have active negotiations with those partners to try to get those rights back for Disney+? Or is the strategy just to wait for those rights to reach their term? And then secondly on Hulu, you've talked about a tighter integration with things like the Fox Studio and FX. Should we expect over time that things like FX and Searchlight that Hulu is their exclusive SVOD partner and sort of complete integration there? Thanks very much.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: I don't think I'm going to talk much about exclusivity except to say that when we think about FX and Searchlight and some of the other Fox entities as well by the way as ABC is for instance in Freeform, we think we have an opportunity if we create the television studio that we aim to create with all the talent that we have and the access to great creative talent as well. And we're going to have an engine at the company coming from the different entities at the company that will be able to supply Hulu with a lot of high quality content and more than they currently have. That is the goal. And again, one of the reasons why we announced the structure that we announced is because we believe that's the best structure for us to execute not just the strategic plans that we have, but to continue to drive growth and results at the traditional businesses. And then on the first question about, what I'll call third-party rights or existing agreements. There's been some reporting about this that we're in the market seeking to amend the terms of some of those agreements. I think it would be best if I simply confirm that we are in some discussions about this, but I'm going to leave it at that. I don't have many details I can give you.\nSteven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks Steven. Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.\nTodd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, thanks a lot for squeezing me in. Always a lot of pressure of being the last one in the queue. I actually had a couple of questions I'd really love to ask, what about the linear TV businesses and how they relate to all this. So the first one is on the Disney Channels Kids side I guess here in the States. There was a note in the press release saying that there's actually a positive source of profit growth year-over-year from factors including decreased marketing spending, decreased programming spending, increased sales content, so I think it might have been to Hulu among others. Is that something we should expect to see as a trend as you think about the role of those linear kids networks with the pending launch of Disney+? And just more broadly, how do you think about the role in the future of those linear kids networks? I'll try to make the second part \u2013 the second part of the question, make it quicker was just \u2013 when you think about the broadcast network ABC. I guess fair to say it has the least amount of sports content among the big four broadcast networks. Obviously that's related to the fact that you own ESPN. Do you think it's important to have ABC maybe participate more strongly in sports generally as you think about the future of the broadcast network business? Thanks.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: We made a decision some years back that because the ESPN brand and ESPN business was so significant and so important to us that that should be our priority when we license sports to put it on ESPN. We also felt that we needed to service ESPN with the kind of programming necessary to drive subscriptions both in terms of the price as well as the number of subscribers. And it was the right thing to do. ESPN will also be called upon to use some of its licensing capabilities to serve as ESPN+. So while I think that there was some sacrifice associated with it, we think it was the right thing to do for the company. Going forward, we haven't made any decisions as to whether we would put more sports onto ABC or back onto ABC. I imagine we'll be opportunistic about it, if the opportunities exist, we will consider it. But right now ESPN, ESPN+ are the priorities. In terms of the Disney Channel comment and the linear networks, we're in linear television in a number of different fronts and we're going to be in more of it once this deal closes both here and the United States and around the world when you consider FX and National Geographic and you add Freeform and ABC and Disney Channel, of course ESPN. We don't intend to get out of those businesses nor do we intend to what I'll call deprioritize them or sacrifice them as we move into those other states. But we're also realists and we see what's going on in the marketplace and we see the growth of new platforms, of program consumption versus channel consumption, of disaggregation and of the potential for disintermediation which basically means the ability for us to take both our channels and our programming direct-to-consumer. We intend to do what is best for the company over the long run if that means continuing to support the linear channels because we believe in their value to the company from a bottom-line perspective we'll do that. And if we see the opportunity grows more and more to not only invest in, but to move programming over to the direct-to-consumer platforms we'll do that. We can't right now in any way estimate if that will happen or when it will happen. But we're going to be nimble as I think we've already evidenced by just the fact that we're going into the direct-to-consumer space as aggressively as we're going into it. We're looking at the marketplace. We're seeing disruption and we're reacting to it hopefully on a timely basis, so we can take advantage of the trends that we're all seeing today in television.\nTodd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks as always for your comments, Bob.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thank you, Todd.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: And thanks again everyone for joining us today.

We sincerely apologize for any difficulty you had joining the call today, and we thank you so much for your patience. My name is Vanessa, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the call over to your host, Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Good afternoon, and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's third quarter 2018 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast, and the webcast and a transcript will also be available on our website. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob will lead off, followed by Christine, and we will then be happy to take your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. Given the events of the last few weeks, I'm going to leave most of the discussion of the quarter to Christine and focus my comments on the 21st Century Fox acquisition to give you greater insight into the tremendous potential we see across our entire company, including our direct-to-consumer services. We're obviously thrilled with the results of the shareholder votes. We're working to secure the remaining regulatory approvals in a number of international territories. The assets we're buying fit perfectly with our plans to substantially grow our intellectual property portfolio and to bring our products to market in ways that consumers, as well as the creative community find extremely compelling. The recent reorganization of our company supports this ambitious vision, in part by allowing a seamless integration of the business's brands, franchises and executive and creative talent from 21st Century Fox. We look forward to the opportunities ahead more confident than ever in our ability to complete this historic acquisition in a timely manner and in our ability to fully leverage these tremendous assets to drive significant shareholder value. It's particularly worth noting that our global growth strategy will be well served by the international properties in the Fox portfolio. Fox Networks Group International's 350 channels reach consumers in 170 countries. Star reaches 720 million viewers a month across India and more than 100 other markets. And as you know, Fox also has a significant stake in Sky, the most successful pay television company in Europe. The addition of these valuable assets will greatly enhance our position as a global entertainment company with excellent production and distribution businesses in key and emerging markets around the world. On the domestic front, we continue to transform our media businesses to take advantage of new technology, as well as the changing consumer trends that are reshaping the media and entertainment landscape. As we predicted, smaller digital bundles have become a rapidly growing part of the MVPD universe. And our early decision to make our high-value channels widely available across these new services certainly added to their consumer appeal. Although, the erosion of the expanded basic bundle continues, the impressive growth of these DMVPDs has steadily slowed overall sub losses. To that end, we've seen noticeable improvement in the rate of sub loss in each of the last four quarters. It's also interesting to note that today more than half of U.S. homes subscribe to streaming services; and on average, they subscribe to three different SVOD products. About 80% of those homes also have MVPD subscription of some kind. Consumers are picking and choosing from all the options in the market to create their own personalized mix of content. Thus, we continue to move full steam ahead on our direct-to-consumer strategy empowered by our strategic purchase of BAMTech, which allowed us to enter this dynamic space quickly and effectively. In this era of unprecedented consumer choice, brands matter more than ever and our incredible portfolio of high-quality, in demand branded content uniquely positions us to strategically and successfully navigate this increasingly dynamic marketplace. We've always believed we have the brands and content to be extremely competitive and to thrive alongside Netflix, Amazon and anyone else in the market. And adding the Fox brands and creative assets such as Searchlight, FX and National Geographic to Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and ABC, will make our DTC products even more compelling for consumers. In addition to the recognizable brands and wealth of world-class content, we're also gaining access to the talent, originality and creativity that makes them great. These businesses have strong relationships and deep respect within the creative community, as well as the proven ability to develop, produce and distribute high-quality content. I thought I'd mention some examples. FX is renowned for great high-quality television. It takes bold and impressive creative risks and it is highly respected for identifying, supporting and nurturing innovative talent. Our plan is to provide even more resources to support FX's existing business and to further invest in FX as a brand and as a critical supplier of original content for our DTC platforms. National Geographic is another tremendous brand built on quality, one that has global reach and cross-generational appeal. We also like that its values are vital and relevant to a planet facing increasing environmental challenge. Again, our goal is to support Nat Geo's expansion around the world and provide the additional resources required to position the brand as another major provider of DTC content. And we see numerous other exciting opportunities for this brand across our entire company, including in the ecotourism space. Fox Searchlight is another creative engine we respect and admire a great deal. With 20 Oscar nominations last year, along with the Academy Award for Best Picture, it's hard to argue that Searchlight needs any help from anyone. Our strategy is to give the studio what it needs to continue to do what it does best and to also expand the brand's high-quality storytelling into the DTC space with original television and film projects. 20th Century Fox Film is yet another example. It gives us the opportunity to be associated with and to expand iconic movie franchises like Avatar, Marvel's X-Men, The Fantastic Four, Deadpool, Planet of the Apes, Kingsman and many others. We're obviously very excited to leverage the Fox assets to enhance and accelerate our DTC strategy, but I want to be clear that we remain incredibly supportive and enthusiastic about the movie theater experience. It's a vital part of our company and, in fact, our studio just crossed $6 billion in global box office for the third year in a row. We're on track for a late-2019 launch of our Disney-branded streaming service. We already have numerous original projects currently in various stages of development and production for this platform, including the world's first live-action Star Wars series and new episodes of the Star Wars: Clone Wars animated series. Our robust content pipeline also includes theatrical movies such as the live-action version of Disney's Lady and the Tramp, as well as new series based on popular IP from across the company such as Disney Channel's High School Musical and Pixar's Monsters, Inc. We're also moving forward with brand new Marvel content and, as I just noted, the Fox acquisition brings even more opportunity to create original programming for this platform. We'll share more details about our Disney DTC plans at an investor presentation in the near future. I also want to note the encouraging initial performance of our ESPN+ service which launched to great reviews and enthusiasm earlier this year. It's still early days, but conversion rates from free trials to paid subscriptions are strong and subscription growth is exceeding our expectations. ESPN+ will become even more compelling to fans across the sports spectrum as we continue to expand the content and enhance the user experience. ESPN has invested wisely in a number of sports events and packages, and the lineup for Plus is quite strong. The UFC and Top Rank Boxing packages made Plus extremely attractive for fans of combat sports. Service will also offer over 200 college football games this year, 70 in the first three weeks of the season alone. And that's on top of thousands of other college sports events. Live events from Major League Baseball, the NHL and MLS will also be regular features on the service. And our new Rights Agreement with Italy's Serie A, one of the world's top soccer leagues, will add more than 340 matches per season to ESPN+ starting this year. It's safe to say, we are very pleased with our progress in the DTC space and having spent months working with Fox management team on integration planning, we've been more enthusiastic and excited by all the opportunities ahead. I'm now going to turn the call over to Christine to discuss the quarter, and then we'll take your questions. Christine?\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of solid financial performance. Total revenues were up 7%, and operating income was up 5%. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter were up 18% to $1.87. At Parks and Resorts, revenues increased 6% and operating income was up 15%, driven by growth at both our domestic and international parks and Disney Cruise Line. Results this year included only one week of the Easter holiday period, whereas third quarter results last year reflected the benefit of both weeks of the holiday period. We estimate this drove an adverse impact to operating income of $47 million or 4 percentage points on the year-over-year growth rate. Despite this headwind, the segment once again delivered very strong results with revenue and operating income setting new Q3 records. Higher operating income at our domestic parks and resorts was primarily due to increased guest spending, partially offset by higher costs. Per capita spending at our domestic parks was up 5% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 8%. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 1% in the quarter and reflects about a 1 percentage point adverse impact from the timing of the Easter holiday. Occupancy at our domestic hotels was down about 2 percentage points to 86%, reflecting reduced room inventory due to room refurbishments and conversions. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing down 2% compared to prior year while booked rates are pacing up, 7%. At our international parks and resorts, higher results were due to increases at Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. Q3 results at Disneyland Paris were roughly comparable to the prior year. At Shanghai Disney Resort, growth in operating income was primarily driven by the timing of expenses and higher attendance, partially offset by lower guest spending. Growth at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was due to higher hotel occupancy and increases in attendance and per capita spending at the park. Total segment operating income margin was up 190 basis points compared to Q3 last year, and we estimate the timing of the Easter holiday had an adverse impact of about 60 basis points on the year-over-year margin growth. Turning to the Studio. Operating income was higher in the third quarter driven by growth in domestic theatrical distribution due to the performance of Avengers: Infinity War and Incredibles 2, compared to Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Cars 3 in Q3 last year. Avengers: Infinity War has grossed over $2 billion globally, making it Marvel's highest grossing film of all time. Incredibles 2 is the top domestic grossing animated film ever and has generated over $1 billion in global box to-date. And we expect Incredibles 2 will end its run as Pixar's highest grossing film, which is quite an accomplishment given Pixar's track record. TV/SVOD results were also higher in the quarter due to a combination of title availabilities, overall growth in our international business and higher rates. These increases were partially offset by lower domestic home entertainment results due primarily to the timing of Star Wars DVD and Blu-ray titles as Star Wars: The Last Jedi was released in Q2 this year, whereas Rogue One was released in Q3 last year. I'd also note that we had about $100 million of film impairments in the quarter, primarily related to two unreleased titles: a Disney Tunes Studio film and other animated project in early development. At Media Networks, operating income was comparable to the third quarter last year as higher results at Broadcasting were offset by a decline at Cable and lower equity income. Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 5% in the quarter due to growth at both Cable and broadcasting. Higher affiliate revenue was driven by 7 points of growth due to higher rates, partially offset by about a 2 point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. As Bob mentioned, this is the fourth consecutive quarter we've seen improvement in the rate of net subscriber declines. While net subscriber counts are still lower than prior year, we're encouraged by the trends we're seeing, a slowdown in the rate of decline of traditional subscribers coupled with an impressive acceleration of growth in digital MVPD subscribers. Our portfolio of networks, which includes ESPN, Disney Channel, Freeform and ABC, offers compelling programming for consumers and continues to be a driver of both traditional and digital MVPD subscriptions. Broadcasting operating income was up 43% in the third quarter due to higher program sales and growth in network affiliate and advertising revenues, partially offset by higher programming costs. Higher income from program sales reflect higher sales of a number of ABC shows, including Designated Survivor and How to Get Away with Murder, as well as higher revenue from the sale of Marvel's Luke Cage in Q3 this year, compared to The Defenders last year. Growth in affiliate revenue was driven by contractual rate increases. Advertising revenue at the ABC Network was up 3% in the quarter as higher rates more than offset lower impressions. Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 23% above upfront levels. Equity income was lower in the quarter due to higher losses at Hulu and lower income from our investment in A+E, partially offset by the absence of equity losses at BAMTech, which, as you know, we now report as part of our Cable results. The higher losses at Hulu were primarily driven by higher programming and labor costs, partially offset by higher subscription and advertising revenue. At Cable, operating income was lower in the quarter as higher results at ESPN were more than offset by a loss at BAMTech. BAMTech's results this quarter reflect higher content and marketing costs and ongoing investment in its technology platform, including costs associated with ESPN+. At ESPN, operating income was higher in the quarter, as growth in affiliate revenue and a favorable comparison to severance costs incurred in Q3 last year more than offset higher programming costs and a decline in advertising revenue. The increase in programming expense was driven by contractual rate increases for NBA programming. Ad revenue at ESPN was down 3% in the quarter as higher rates were more than offset by lower impressions. So far this quarter, ESPN's cash ad sales are pacing down 3% compared to prior year. At Consumer Products and Interactive Media, operating income was down in the quarter as a result of lower licensing income and a decline in comp store sales, partially offset by lower costs at our games business. The decline in licensing was driven by lower revenue from the sale of Spider Man and Cars merchandise as both properties benefited from theatrical film releases in the prior year, partially offset by higher revenue from Avengers merchandise. We expect some of the headwinds that impacted our Consumer Products business in Q3 will also impact the business in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, corporate expenses were about $100 million higher than the prior year. The single biggest driver of the growth was expenses related to our Fox acquisition. In Q4, we expect corporate expenses to be higher by about $35 million, driven almost entirely by Fox acquisition-related costs. During the third quarter, we repurchased 9.6 million shares for $970 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 34.6 million shares for approximately $3.6 billion. Given our pending acquisition of Fox and the expected increase in leverage in order to fund the $35.7 billion cash component, we will not be an active buyer of our stock until our total leverage ratios return to levels consistent with a A credit rating. At the time we announced our revised offer for Fox, we said this could happen by the end of fiscal 2021 or by the end of fiscal 2022 depending on the outcome of the Fox-Sky transaction. The ultimate timetable will depend on whether Fox acquires full ownership of Sky, as well as the amount of proceeds from the RSN disposition. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell, and we'd be happy to take your questions.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: All right. Thanks, Christine. Operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: And thank you. Our first question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.\nMichael Brian Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Thanks. Bob, I have two here. One is on Netflix and your strategy. If we think about what Netflix was able to accomplish, it was just an amazing amount of choice and personalization. So when I think about your own OTT strategy, you have a great content library, you're acquiring a content library, but you're thinking about maybe different apps to different consumers, constituents of different brands. So can you walk through kind of the pluses and minuses you have within Disney on the strategy of maybe building one aggregated app versus going in segments? And how do you think about that? And the second question is just about China, and any update on timing on the regulatory front on the China side?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Michael. I'll answer the second question first. We have no updates regarding the regulatory filings. In June, our S-4 stated that we anticipated getting the necessary regulatory filings in the various markets around the world between 6 and 12 months from then, and we don't intend to update that at all. Regarding Netflix and our strategy regarding the apps, first of all, because we will be launching the Disney app into the market probably in about, well, a year, sometime the end of calendar 2019, we're going to walk before we run as it relates to volume of content because it takes time to build the kind of content library that ultimately we intend to build. That said, because the Disney app will feature Pixar, Marvel, Disney, ultimately National Geographic will be a contributor, Lucasfilm, Star Wars, we feel that it does not have to have anything close to the volume of what Netflix has because of the value of the brands and the specific value of the programs that will be included on it. And the price, by the way, will also reflect a lower volume of product as will, by the way, the cost of producing and owning all that content. Obviously, after the deal closes for 21st Century Fox, we'll own 60% of Hulu. So that will fit in very significantly to our app strategy. And then I talked about in my earlier comments and we've spoken a fair amount about this in the past, we have the ESPN app. As we look at all three, it is our feeling \u2013 and as we look at the environment today, I guess one thing you could even point to would be the great growth in the new digital OTT offerings where you're looking at essentially fewer channels, slightly less choice for less cost. We don't really want to go to market with an aggregation play that replicates the multi-channel environment that exists today because we feel consumers are more interested in essentially making decisions on their own in terms of what kind of packages that they want. So rather than one, let's call it, gigantic aggregated play, we're going to bring to the market what we've already brought to market, sports play. I'll call it Disney Play, which is more family-oriented. And then, of course, there's Hulu. And they will basically be designed to attract different tastes and different segment or audience demographics. If a consumer wants all three, ultimately, we see an opportunity to package them from a pricing perspective. But it could be that a consumer just wants sports or just wants family or just wants the Hulu offering, and we want to be able to offer that kind of flexibility to consumers because that's how we feel the consumer behavior, what consumer behavior demands in today's environment.\nMichael Brian Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Okay. Thanks, Bob.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Michael, thank you. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Yes. Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. I want to stay on the OTT topic. Bob, a couple of years ago when you guys had the first Star Wars film come out, you talked about sort of leveraging the entire company's assets to really make that movie successful or as successful as it could be, made it a priority for the company. Is there a similar opportunity with this OTT launch? And I don't know if there's anything you'd be willing to share with us today. I know it's a year away, but how you might be thinking about leveraging the Parks or your Media Networks or other parts of the business to really make sure that thing gets off the ground with as much momentum as possible? And then, Christine, for you, honestly a bit of an accounting question, but I think important. Have you guys figured out how you're going to account for the content production on the OTT? So I think you're already spending money on developing and I don't know if you're close to shooting anything at this point, but will that stuff go in the balance sheet and then be amortized over some useful life estimate? Anything you can give us there, since this will start to build in dollar terms, would be helpful. Thank you, both.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Ben, the launch of the Disney DTC products at the end of 2019 is probably the biggest priority \u2013 is the biggest priority of the company during calendar 2019. And there will be a significant amount of support given across all of our assets to see to it that that product launches successfully. We, obviously, from a Disney perspective, have connection with and we are in touch with Disney consumers, Disney aficionados, all over the world, not just people who've gone to our parks or the people who've been to our movies and bought a variety of consumer products and have joined the various Disney affinity organizations, like D23. And so, we actually think that the first priority is going to be reaching the core Disney fan, and we certainly have a number of different company touch points to do that. And then on the second part, I'll let Christine talk about the cost and how we're going to ultimately manage it from a financial perspective.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Ben, so the way we're going to treat the content is we will be capitalizing the cost of the new content. And as you know, we will be starting to do that now and going forward until the launch. That will be put on the balance sheet, and we will amortize it once it's finished and airing.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you, both.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Ben. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Yes. Our next question is from Jessica Reif with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: All right. Thank you. I have a couple of questions on the Fox acquisition. You gave a number when you announced of $2 billion of synergy, which I think was all cost. And then on this call you've talked about investing at some of the brands like Nat Geo, FX, et cetera. Can you talk a little bit about the investment that you see over the next couple of years? Anything you can say on incremental revenue? And what's the timing of the transition, of the management team transition? Will it only be closer to the closing? And then a different topic, just a quick question. But theme parks, your margins are getting closer to prior peak, so what you've outlined. Can you just talk about where you see that going? Do you have plans to build hotels given all the attractions that you're planning over the next, let's say, three years?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: You're right, Jessica. We have spoken about $2 billion in cost synergies and we're confident that we're going to be able to deliver those. There will be revenue synergies as well, but we have not been specific about what they are and we don't intend to get specific about that at least for the foreseeable future. Maybe eventually we will, but right now we don't intend to. We are looking at incremental investment from a content perspective from both the Disney side of the company. So we have a variety of different, as you know, original productions in development and production right now essentially to feed the app. We also intend to turn to the Fox side of the business. I mentioned National Geographic, FX, Searchlight. We look at the Fox Television Studios. They are not only great franchises and brands that come out of those organizations, but there's a lot of talent both on the executive front and there are talent relationships that we can turn to, to help essentially fuel the direct-to-consumer businesses that we have. We've not been specific about what kind of incremental production cost is associated, but certainly there will be some. We believe that as we get closer to launch, we'll have the ability to just be a little bit more specific with all of you about what our plans are from a cost perspective.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: The only thing I would add to that, Jessica, is on the cost that $2 billion we had given that it would be achieved after the second year post-closing and that would be roughly 50% in the first year, 50% by the end of the second year. And you can anticipate more domestic at the front end just because of regulatory issues outside of the U.S. On the parks margins, you did indicate that you saw that increase. Year-over-year, the park margin expanded by 190 basis points this quarter and that included the negative drag from the holiday shift. So that included the 60 basis point drag. The opportunities that we see of continuing to expand parks margin will be yield management, which we have talked to you about before. And we still believe that there is opportunity for that especially in the domestic market.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: And particularly given the fact that we've launched some very, very attractive new properties, including Toy Story Land and the Star Wars Land is going to open sometime in calendar 2019, so that's going to give us some pricing or revenue yield opportunities as well.\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay. Thanks, Jessica. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you. Just two questions. The first one is on ESPN+. Can you give us any more data maybe on subscriber growth? I think you said it's exceeding expectation. I don't know if it's soon to give us a number and if there are any lessons you may have learned as you plan for the Disney direct-to-consumer launch from that launch? And my second question is really, I think you're going through a pretty notable renewable cycle between your major affiliate deals up in 2019. The question is really how you're balancing those negotiations with the distributors given your high profile direct-to-consumer priorities?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Well, I'll answer the second question. We'll be going to market with some very attractive product. Obviously, I don't know if we could cover all of what they are because you certainly know what they are, Alexia. And we also know that the traditional distributors are very, very interested in distributing our DTC products as they do right now, by the way, for Netflix. And so, we actually believe that they can in a sense live side-by-side as part of the negotiation and not necessarily create issues. I think there is a reality that is set-in in the distribution side of the business that the business is changing, that consumer habits have changed, and that the over-the-top SVOD product is here to stay and is real, and is probably going to continue to either compete with the more traditional platforms or complement the more traditional platforms. So we don't really see it complicating our negotiations with the primary distributors. The first on, ESPN+, I realized when I said that the subscriber numbers were exceeding our expectations, it was probably going to beg the question, well, then what are they and we haven't been specific. They don't tell you if (33:19) we're telling the truth, so that doesn't do much good. We had relatively modest expectations. I'm not going to be specific on numbers. We're just not ready to get into that. But as it related to what kind of subscribers we would ultimately achieve from the beginning in part because of the nature of the product offering, but actually we've added nicely to that product offering. Boxing is the probably the primary example, but there has been some other good programming as well. And we've been heartened by the fact that the conversion rates from free to pay have been quite strong and the trends that we're seeing in terms of churn are modest in nature in the sense that they're manageable. As we add more product, I mentioned in my comments, we've got a huge lineup of college football, 200 games coming up this coming season, 70 in the first three weeks. UFC kicks in. Today, we announced the inclusion of the very attraction Italian soccer league Serie A. So Cristiano Ronaldo's first match with his new team will be on ESPN+, which is exciting. And then, of course, as the season unfolds the next baseball season and the NHL season, MLS, there'll be regular games from all three of those leagues and more and more programming. So we feel really good about how we are positioned and we'll continue to look opportunistically in terms of what rights will be available. A lot of the rights in sports are already spoken for, but we still have some opportunities including some opportunities to take some of the rights that we already own for the ESPN primary channels and move them along. Give you an example is, we have a lot of inventory for Little League World Series. And we've noted that as we've gotten more specific with consumers about what Little League games will be available, our subscription sign-ups have ballooned in the last few days as a for instance we believe as a result of interest in just that. So we actually feel good about it. It's a marathon; it's not a sprint. The product seems to be working well technologically. It's quite stable from a streaming perspective, and we feel great about it.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: All right. Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Alexia. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse.\nDouglas Mitchelson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks so much. One for Bob, one for Christine. Bob, are there any overarching principles that is driving how much you think is the right investment level in streaming? For example, is there a need to move quickly because otherwise the market would be passing by? Or should you move slowly to manage the impact on earnings? Any framing of the factors that determine how aggressively the company is turning to digital would be helpful? And then, for Christine, similar to Ben, an accounting question related to streaming service. How do you manage the Pay 1 rights for calendar 2019 films from an accounting perspective? Does this will apply to other factors as well. Does the film division still include Pay 1 revenue in its ultimates for calendar 2019 releases when determining film amortization by window? Or is that something actually you have to wait for the streaming service to launch and the streaming service to buy that content? Thanks.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: So, Doug, to answer the first question, we don't see the need to rush because the market will pass us by, simply because the only place people are going to be able to get Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars original product is going to be on this app. And so, we believe whenever we launch, it will be attractive. What we want to do is we want to make sure when we launch it is viewed as a quality product that we're serving the fans, particularly of Marvel, Pixar, Disney and Star Wars well, and that the price that we're charging reflects the value that we're delivering. We've mentioned a number of times that we have the luxury of programming this product with programs from those brands or derived from those brands, which obviously creates a demand and gives us the ability to not necessarily be in the volume game, but to be in the quality game. And that's not in any way suggesting that Netflix isn't in the quality game. There's a lot of quality there, but they're also in the high volume game. And we don't really need to do that. We will fill in, in terms of creating volume with a significant amount of library content, both movie and television content. And so, it's not as though the cupboard's going to be bare, but we want to produce the programming that we're putting on under the right circumstances which means with the right budgets and the right timing. It takes time to produce these, particularly to produce them well. There are a number that already in production. And so, we feel good about ultimately what we're going to lunch with. But I think the way to look at it is to look at it as a service that is focused on those brands. We'll also infuse it with National Geographic product as well when the time is right to do that. We will continue to spend incrementally on this service; we talked about that a fair amount. But we will always do so, again, with the knowledge that because of the specificity of these brands and the uniqueness of them, that we don't have to be in the absolute volume game. We have to put enough on to make sense from a price to value relationship perspective.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay, Doug. For the question of the pay-TV one window. For the time being, you should assume status quo. But as the service launches, we will be reevaluating the way we're treating that window, and we'll be getting more information once we finalize how we're going to account for it.\nDouglas Mitchelson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: All right. Thank you both.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay. Thanks, Doug. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein.\nTodd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks. Bob, I know you talked about an investor event coming up soon talking about the DTC stuff. And yet, I'm going to ask you, just like everybody else if you don't mind, a question on that topic. So you've listed now a couple times all of these great brands that will exist and live on the Disney direct-to-consumer entertainment service. I guess my question is pretty much every brand you listed, I believe, has historical content obligations to other licensing partners. So, for instance, I'm thinking about Star Wars, the movies are either on Netflix or even on Turner cable syndication in the states. Marvel movies are on Stars or Netflix, that sort of thing. So I guess my question is, can you just confirm that when you launch a whole bunch of those historical products associated with those brands, I guess, will not be on your service, it doesn't sound like. In fact, there's some scenario where there's no Star Wars old movies at all maybe. I'd love a comment on that. I might be wrong because I don't know the exact carve-outs. So that's the main question. And if that's true, how big a deal is it and how are you going to message that \u2013 are you thinking with your consumers? Thanks.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Well, we knew when we made the decision to do this that a number of the products that have been made and it will be made in the rest of 2018 are encumbered by licensing arrangements that we have with a number of different entities. In notably, Netflix and Stars you mentioned, there are some windows down the road that enable us to put those films on our service. I don't think we've been specific about that, but you'll see when we launch. But starting in 2019, the movies \u2013 the Studio movie slate is clean and unencumbered. And so, one of the reasons why we've talked about \u2013 I don't want to say walk before we run because it's not quite that. There's going to be a fair amount of running going on. But we want to make sure we're managing expectations. The price of the service will reflect that. The volume of the product it's on. But it's also one of the reasons why we're creating a fair amount of original content for it as well, original Star Wars series, original Pixar series, original Marvel series and so on. And some original films as well because it's clear that from a library perspective while there is certainly a lot of volume, the recent Studio slate will not fully be available at any one-time because of the existing deals and it wouldn't take time for those rights ultimately to revert back to us. But what we have been doing is making sure that since the time that we made the decision to bring the service out, we've not done anything that further encumbers any of our product.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Todd?\nTodd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. If there is any quick comment on how you have thought about messaging this to a consumer who might buy your service expecting to see, whatever a Star Wars movie and not find it there? And any concerns you have about (42:33)?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: We're obviously going to make sure that when we bring this product forward, we market it. People are going to know that if they're looking for, I don't know, The Force Awakens, that it's not going to be on. But if they're looking for Star Wars movies that launched in 2019 or original Star Wars series, you will find that here. And as rights become available or as we're able to negotiate for rights to bring back, you'll see them on the service and so on and so on. But if you look at the 2019 Studio slate, I saw something recently posted just about the Studio slate. So in calendar 2019, the Studio slate is about as strong as it gets. And to give you some ideas, it's got Captain Marvel, Dumbo, Avengers, Aladdin, Toy Story 4, The Lion King, Artemis Fowl, Jungle Cruise, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: Episode IX, all in calendar 2019. None of those films are encumbered by existing distribution deals. So when we launch at the end of 2019, now they still have to be windowed in based on how we bring product to market, but the windowing will not be affected by existing licensing deals. So again, I'm going to read those again, but calendar 2019: Captain Marvel, Dumbo, Avengers, Aladdin, Toy Story 4, Lion King, Artemis Fowl, Jungle Cruise, Frozen 2 and Star Wars. That's a pretty strong slate.\nTodd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Happily, no argument with that. Thank you, Bob.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Todd. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Cahall with Royal Bank.\nSteven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Maybe just first you mentioned the content that you'll be getting from Fox from Nat Geo and FX and Searchlight.\nOperator: Pardon me, Steven, you're breaking up. Is there any way you can clear your connection, sir?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: I heard it. Go ahead, go ahead.\nOperator: That's better.\nSteven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. [Technical Difficulty] (44:49-45:07).\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Steven, it's Lowell. Yeah, it's very hard. You're breaking up. We're hearing every other word.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Sounds like a good question.\nSteven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Let me get back in the queue. I'll turn it back.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay. Sorry about that. Let's go to the next question, operator.\nOperator: Yes. Our next question is from David Miller with Imperial Capital.\nDavid W. Miller - Imperial Capital LLC: Yeah. Hi. Just a quick financial question for Christine. Christine, it looks like you have a couple of upcoming maturing securities. The September 2018, $500 million that's the corporate MTN; and then the January 2019, I think that's $400 million senior unsecured. Just curious what you plan to do about those. I assume you could take them out, but just curious as to your thoughts. Thanks so much.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Yeah. Thanks, David. We have plenty of capacity to satisfy those maturities. It's absolutely no issue for us from a liquidity perspective.\nDavid W. Miller - Imperial Capital LLC: Okay. Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thank you, David. Operator, let's take one more question, please.\nOperator: Yes, sir. Our next question is from Tim Nollen with Macquarie.\nTim Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks very much. Couple of things, please. You mentioned a decline in ad revenue at ESPN in the quarter and it looks like another similar type of decline in the quarter we're in now. Wonder if you could just talk a little bit about what's driving that. And then I wonder, Bob, you mentioned Sky as part of your comments around Fox. I wonder if there's anything more you could give us a hint on as to what happens with the remainder of the Sky stake that Comcast is bidding for. I don't know if there's anything you can say. And likewise on the RSNs, I thought the original understanding was that Fox would take those back if that were a regulatory issue. It now seems more like this is something you would take on and then be forced to sell. I don't know if there's anything you could mention on that as well, please.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: On the RSNs, no. We took on initially in the December deal that we announced, we assumed the responsibility of divestiture if the regulatory process demanded that we do that. It wasn't Fox that would either buy them under those circumstances or would take them back. The RSNs though in the agreement that was reached with the Justice Department will be sold and the process of selling them is actually already beginning, in that conversations are starting, interest is being expressed. And it's likely that we'll negotiate a deal to sell them, but the deal will not be fully executed, or won't close until after the overall deal for 21st Century Fox closes. There's nothing more really to add on that. On Sky, there's really nothing further to add. I think just to clarify because there were some erroneous reports about this. But there was a filing in the UK today. It was a formal filing as per UK Law, and that's what Fox had to do to basically formalize its \u00a314 offer for the remaining 61%. But as per our July 8-K filing, our consent is required for an increase in that bid. And since this is a fluid situation, an open matter, we really are not going to comment any further about it. I think that would be the most appropriate.\nTim Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Understood.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: And on ESPN ad sales, as you noted, ad revenue was down in the third quarter and it's still kind of early in the fourth quarter. As Bob mentioned, college football, we are getting into that season and the match-ups are all getting out in the marketplace and we expect the ad revenue to reflect that. Just looking back at third quarter, I do want to make the note that the difference in the number of NBA Playoffs and final games when you adjust for that, we had one fewer final, we had two fewer semi-finals, but we had the benefit of three additional conference finals. When you net all that out, ESPN's ad sales in 3Q would have been roughly similar to the prior year.\nTim Nollen - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay. Tim. Thanks. And thanks again, everyone, for joining us today.

My name is Michelle, and I will be your operator for today's conference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that today's conference is being recorded. I would now turn the call over to Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Good afternoon, and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's second quarter 2018 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and a copy of the webcast and a transcript will be available on our website. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob will lead off, followed by Christine. And then, of course, we'll be happy to take your questions. So with that, let me turn it over to Bob, and we'll get started.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased with our results in Q2, especially in our Parks and Resorts and Studio businesses. Our parks continue to drive growth through operational excellence and by effectively leveraging our extraordinary content. As an example, I just got back from opening our new Toy Story Land in Shanghai Disneyland, and I'm happy to report that our first major addition to the park was met with strong reviews and excitement. We're thrilled with the reaction. And the enthusiasm generated by the new land bodes well for future expansion. Toy Story Land also opens in Orlando next month. Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge will open in both Disneyland and Disney World by the end of calendar 2019, and there's a lot more expansion underway in our Parks and Resorts around the world. Turning to our Studio, it's hard to come up with enough superlatives to adequately express the tremendous work that team is doing. It's clear from the recent results, as well as from the slate ahead, that our Studio has and will continue to raise the bar in terms of both creative and commercial success. The incredible performance of Marvel's Black Panther is just one of many examples. This groundbreaking movie opened to huge acclaim and record-breaking box office, instantly becoming a cultural phenomenon, inspiring people of all ages and breaking down age-old industry myths. With more than $1.3 billion in box office to-date, Black Panther makes a very loud statement about the importance of risk taking and the value of inclusion. We're proud of this movie on so many levels. It speaks volumes about great innovative story-telling, the power of new perspectives, and unbridled creativity. We follow the phenomenal success of Black Panther with another Marvel masterpiece Avengers: Infinity War, which broke domestic and global records to become the largest movie opening in history. With this latest success, our studio has delivered 9 of the top 10 biggest domestic box office openings of all time, all of them released in the last six years. Infinity War crossed $1 billion at the box office faster than any film ever released, with worldwide box office of $1.2 billion to-date before it is even opened in China. Judging from strong ticket pre-sales and anticipation I saw during my recent visit, Chinese audiences are eager to see this movie too. There are now 19 movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with a combined box office of more than $16 billion and an average box office of $845 million per film. The MCU is by far the most lucrative box office franchise of all time, creating an incredible pipeline of proven branded IP that drives significant opportunity across our entire organization. The rest of our studio slate is just as impressive, starting with Solo: A Star Wars Story, which is generating a lot of interest and strong buzz ahead of its Memorial Day weekend opening. We'll follow that by releasing a dozen big movies over the next 18 months, including: Incredibles 2, Ant-Man and The Wasp, Ralph Breaks the Internet, Mary Poppins Returns, Captain Marvel, Dumbo, Avengers 4, Aladdin, Toy Story 4, The Lion King, Frozen 2, and Star Wars: Episode IX. Looking at this collection gives you a real sense of what's in store when we launch our Disney branded direct-to-consumer service in late-2019. We're creating a truly unique value proposition for consumers, a service focused on quality over quantity, featuring film and television products from our foremost collection of family-oriented brands. Our content strategy includes a rich mix of beloved classics, recent releases and new content being created exclusively for the new platform by Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm. We'll share more details in the coming months, including the robust slate of original movies, series and other content currently being developed. The deeper we delve into the possibilities of this platform, the more excited we are by its potential to drive value. And we're more confident than ever that we're creating an exceptional entertainment experience that consumers will find very appealing. On the sports front, we're very encouraged by the reaction to our ESPN+ service, which launched just about a month ago. The reviews have been strong and the response of sports fans has been enthusiastic. And the new deal we announced this morning will add a rich slate of UFC content to the mix, including live events and original content created exclusively for ESPN+. As we've said before, our incomparable collection of strong brands recognized and respected the world over puts us in a great position to lead the way when it comes to building the direct relationships with consumers that will define the future of media. Our recent reorganization reflects our determination to effectively capitalize on a rapidly changing landscape, increasingly defined by transformative technology and evolving consumer expectations. Our Studio and Media Networks are content engines for the entire company, and we're maximizing their value by combining the management of our direct-to-consumer distribution platforms, technology and international operations, to deliver the entertainment and sports content that people around the world want most, with far more choice, personalization and convenience than ever before. We're also merging consumer products in Parks and Resorts together, combining strategy and resources to create extraordinary experiences and products that bring our stories and characters to life for consumers inside our parks, at home, and beyond. We believe this new structure positions our businesses for the future creating a more effective global framework to serve consumers worldwide, promote growth, and maximize shareholder value. It brings our operations into even closer alignment with our long-term strategy creating high-quality content, innovative use of technology and global expansion, including robust direct-to-consumer distribution. If you recall, when we announced the Fox deal, we noted that it would serve the same strategic priorities. And for this reason, we're confident the assets we're in the process of acquiring easily fit within our new structure once the deal is approved. We're still deep in the regulatory process, so I can't share any more information or engage in further speculation about the deal, except to say that we strongly believe in the value of those assets as part of our ongoing strategy to create growth in a very dynamic global marketplace. I'm going to turn the call over to Christine to discuss details of our Q2 results, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. Christine?\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of outstanding financial performance. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the second fiscal quarter were up 23% to $1.84. Our results this quarter reflect strength in our Parks and Resorts and Studio Entertainment segments. At Parks and Resorts, revenues increased 13% and operating income was up 27%, driven by growth at our domestic and international parks and resorts. I'll note that second quarter results reflect the benefit of one week of the Easter holiday period, whereas the two-week holiday period fell entirely in the third quarter last year. We estimate the timing of Easter drove a $47 million benefit to operating income. This benefit was partially offset by the adverse impact of the 14-day dry-dock of the Disney Magic, which reduced Disney Cruise Line's operating income by about $20 million. The segment delivered another quarter of stellar results with revenue and operating income setting new Q2 records even after taking into account the net impact of these two items. Higher operating income at our domestic parks and resorts was primarily due to higher guest spending and attendance, partially offset by higher costs. Per capita spending was up 6% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 12% and occupancy was up about 2 percentage points to 90%. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 5% in the quarter and reflects about a 2 percentage point benefit from the timing of the Easter holiday. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing down 4% compared to prior year, reflecting reduced room inventory due to conversions and ongoing room refurbishments and the impact of only one week of the Easter holiday period in the third quarter, compared to two weeks last year. Booked rates are pacing up 8%. At our international parks and resorts, growth in operating income was due to increases at Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. At Disneyland Paris, the resort's 25th anniversary celebration continued to drive higher guest spending, attendance, and hotel occupancy. Growth at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was due to increases in occupied room nights and attendance. At Shanghai Disney Resort unfavorable weather early in the quarter resulted in lower attendance, which drove a decrease in operating income compared to prior year. However, we saw a nice recovery starting in March and expect this positive trend to continue given the recent launch of Toy Story Land. Total segment operating income margin was up 220 basis points compared to Q2 last year. Our Studio had another phenomenal quarter. Operating income was up 29% to $847 million, setting a new second quarter record. Growth in operating income was due to increases in our theatrical and home entertainment businesses and growth in TV/SVOD distribution. We had expected Q2 theatrical results to face a comparability challenge, given the performance of Beauty and the Beast and the carry-over performance of Rogue One and Moana during the second quarter last year. However, as Bob discussed, we couldn't be more pleased with the performance of Black Panther, which surpassed our expectations and drove a meaningful increase in our worldwide theatrical results. Turning to Media Networks, operating income decreased in the second quarter due to lower equity income and a decline at cable. Equity income was lower in the quarter due to higher losses at Hulu, partially offset by higher income from our investment in A+E. The higher losses at Hulu were primarily driven by continued investments in programming and marketing, partially offset by higher subscription and advertising revenue. Cable operating income was lower in the quarter due to losses at BAMTech and, to a lesser extent, lower results at Freeform and ESPN. I'll remind you that BAMTech's results last year were reflected in equity in the income of investees, but are now reported as part of our cable results due to our acquisition of a controlling stake last year. The operating loss of BAMTech for the second quarter reflects ongoing investment in its technology platform including cost associated with ESPN+. We now expect BAMTech's results to have an adverse impact on Media Networks' fiscal 2018 operating income of $180 million compared to the prior year. This is $50 million worse than our previous estimates, due primarily to increased investment in ESPN+. I'll also note that about $100 million of the full-year impact is expected during the third quarter. At ESPN, higher programming expenses more than offset growth in affiliate and advertising revenues. The increase in programming spend was driven by the timing of both the College Football Playoff semifinal bowl games and the start of the Major League Baseball season, and contractual rate increases for other college sports and MBA programming. Like last year, ESPN aired three of the New Year's six bowl games during the second quarter. However, the mix of games included the two semifinal games in Q2 this year, whereas the semifinal games aired in the first quarter last year. Ad revenue at ESPN was up 3% in the quarter due to higher rates, which benefited from the timing of the College Football Playoff semifinal bowl games. We estimate the shift of the two semifinal bowl games into Q2 this year had a positive impact of about 5 percentage points on ad revenue growth in the second quarter. So far this quarter, ESPN's cash ad sales are pacing down 1% compared to prior year. Broadcasting results were comparable to Q2 last year as growth in affiliate revenue was offset by a decrease in advertising revenue, lower income from program sales, and higher network programming and marketing expenses. The decrease in advertising revenue was due to fewer network impressions, partially offset by higher rates. Lower income from program sales primarily reflect higher sales of How to Get Away with Murder in Q2 last year compared to this year. Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 27% above upfront levels. Total Media Network's affiliate revenue was up 5% in the quarter due to growth at both cable and broadcasting. Higher affiliate revenue was driven by 7 points of growth due to higher rates, partially offset by about a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. While the impact of subscriber declines on affiliate revenue growth still rounds to 3 points, I'll note that this is the third consecutive quarter we've seen modest decelerations in the rate of net subscriber declines. And, finally, Consumer Products & Interactive Media results were lower in the quarter as higher licensing income was more than offset by lower comparable store sales in our retail business and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. During second quarter, we repurchased 12.2 million shares for $1.3 billion. And year-to-date, we've repurchased 31.3 million shares for approximately $3.2 billion. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell and we'd be more than happy to take your questions.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Christine. Operator, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session The first question in the queue comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. I have two questions, one on the Parks business and one on your digital strategy. When you look at the recent results, Bob, over the last few years, the parks have been growing operating income at I think a pretty healthy double-digit clip. Can you talk about the runway ahead for that business, whether it's sort of pricing power capacity at the hotels? You mentioned, or Christine mentioned, 90% occupancy, the ability to drive additional operating leverage. I think you're margins are \u2013 I think they're at all-time highs. When you look out over the next three to four years assuming the economy is okay, can you just talk about the drivers of continued growth at the levels we've gotten accustomed to? And on the digital front, I don't know if you can answer this, but I thought I'd take a stab. You announced your digital pivot last year ahead of the Fox announcement. So maybe you could talk about how essential or not Fox and its associated global assets are to your digital strategy as you look out over time?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Sure. Thanks, Ben. On the first question, we think that there's ample room for expansion. It will come from multiple directions. One, I mean, expense, I'm talking about growth, obviously the bottom line. One will come from expansion. As you know, we are building out all of our parks, including the Toy Story Lands is about to open in Florida, the one that just opened in Shanghai, the cruise ships, the two Star Wars Lands, multiple hotels around the world, new lands in places like Paris and Tokyo, and I could go on. So that's one. Two, we believe that the use of our IP, which is part of a lot of this expansion, creates growth. And, of course, the more popular our IP is, the more in demand is at our parks. Another opportunity is in pricing. As we build out these experiences in terms of scope and scale, but also as we make them better experiences using technology to do things like book attractions in advance, et cetera, we believe that gives us pricing leverage that comes from simply delivering a better experience. And the last is that business has been great at running under very, very efficient circumstances. And while we're not going to promise continued margin expansion, we certainly believe that that opportunity exists. So we feel, overall, great about the future of this business, particularly by the way as we get to build out some of the newer parks, Shanghai being probably the best example of that. On the second question, we announced, as you suggested, the two new digital products \u2013 the ESPN+ product and the Disney product \u2013 well in advance of the Fox acquisition. So neither one is dependent upon that acquisition. Both are capable of taking advantage of some of the assets we'll be buying as part of that acquisition. On the sports front, the regional sports networks. And then on the Disney front, we think there's some great opportunities for Nat Geo and some of the other Fox properties to be part of the Disney family direct-to-consumer proposition. But that largely is going to be anchored by Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars, so not dependent at all on the assets that we're buying from Fox. Of course, we end up in this acquisition owning 60% of Hulu, and it is our intention to continue to fuel Hulu with more original programming. And much of that original programming will come from the assets of both Disney and Fox. Think FX as one example, Searchlight is another, it's using some of the other Fox intellectual property. But I'd say, when we announced a year ago, we were not talking about Hulu, we were talking about these two new properties. And again, neither is dependent upon, but stands to benefit from the Fox acquisition.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's helpful. Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Ben. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The next question in the queue comes from Jessica Reif from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Two questions. On ESPN+, I know it's early days, but can you talk about any learnings you've had so far regarding consumer behavior, the technology? You've added original content today, you announced to-date. Do you think you need more? And how that would apply to the Disney DTC? And then, we're going into upfront actually next week. Can you talk about your views of how the market's shaping up? And given the changes in the overall environment, how do you think the sales process will change?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: The first part, we are not going to give you statistics except on ESPN+, except to say that so far so good. A number of people have signed up, obviously, for the trial and our conversion rates have been good so far. Most importantly, the technology is working, the user interface is considered good, the fan reaction has been quite strong. We're going to continue to improve it. There is always opportunity to get better, and that's what we'll do. But basically I give it a so far so good. I watched \u2013 not on a WiFi connection, but I watched the other day a live Yankee game basically while I was sitting in my car the quality was fantastic. And I found that as I customize it with my favorite teams, et cetera, and so on, that is serving me and my sports interest quite well and I assume that's the case with our consumers. We did announce today the acquisition of the UFC events starting in 2019 for five years. That's a start. We intend to continue to invest in buying product that is original, whether it's specific for the app both live sports and non-live sports. We've also moved some products over there and put some library products over there, and we think that there is a lot of opportunity for us to continue to fuel that experience with product you don't get to see on the linear network. Just as a for instance, we've launched the equivalent of a short SportsCenter that Scott Van Pelt is doing that will be available on a daily basis. So there's a lot of opportunity, and we're going to continue to invest. On the Disney front, we're in right now the process of creating a lot of original content. We're launching in late-2019. That's to wait for some of our movie output to become available once the Netflix deal expires, and also to give us an opportunity to ramp up some of the original content that we're creating for it. And we've said a few times, we're going to get more specific about that as we get closer. But we're producing right now content for it, original content that is Pixar branded, Marvel branded, Star Wars branded and Disney branded. And we are feeling quite good about the direction that we're headed there. In the Disney case, we're looking for quality over quantity. We're not looking for essentially massive amounts of content. We're looking for high-quality content utilizing those brands and the franchise and the characters that fall under those brands. Right now, I feel good about both.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: On the upfront, Jessica, we feel really good about where we are with both the ABC properties, as well as the Disney television group, as well as ESPN as we enter those. Right now where we see the season to-date, we've got good ratings momentum with a couple of new shows, American Idol as well as Roseanne. And we feel really good about the other shows that we'll be presenting next week. One of the things that is different is about a year ago we consolidated the ad buying or the ad selling through our Disney-ABC Television Group. So this is the upfront that they're up and running as a single sales entity. So we think that's also going to help our upfront sales.\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Jessica. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. And the next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Thanks. Bob, I have two for you. The first one is, I wanted to hear a bit about the re-org you guys put through in in March where you shifted advertising, content sales, international to one division. And what were you trying to gain by doing that? And then, secondly, when we think about what you've done in China in putting a park there to kind of build awareness for the Disney brand. As you move to more of a global OTT strategy, would you ever consider building parks in other parts of the world as kind of a brand beacon for just the overall interest in Disney's products?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: I'll answer the second part first. We think that there's opportunity to expand in China, and there may also be opportunities in other parts of the world. We are constantly engaging in conversations with people from different markets who would love us to put Disneyland in their market. We're going to take a look at some of them because of the population base that lives in those markets, and consider all the factors that we typically have consider which are things like economic and political stability, spendable income, other infrastructure issues, you name it. But I'd say that there's an inevitability to us of building parks in other countries, but it doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to build something anytime very soon. But we're going to look. On the first question, when we were considering the best way to integrate the Fox assets, we asked ourselves how best to organize the company. And one of the things that we looked at was how some of the new entrants in the marketplace are organized. And you typically find \u2013 Netflix is a good example. They have global platforms that their content is basically distributed on. And that includes global means of managing customers, data management billing, customer acquisition, customer retention, you name it. It's essentially one technology. And I then thought, if all of these assets were to come together today from day one and in fact on day one without any of the legacy organizational issues, how would you best organize them? And it became clear that we could be organized, not only in a more efficient way, but in a more modern way to take into account how our businesses have been transformed by technology. And that led to a decision to reorganize now well ahead of the Fox acquisition, because if it made sense once we buy Fox, it seemed to make sense even before that. So what we basically did is we have three primary content divisions: one I'll call Media Networks or television; another one would be sports, ESPN; and the third is the Studio. The Fox assets would plug into all three of those. Then there was a division that was mostly focused on physical goods and experiences, where there were some obvious synergies and overlap in efficiencies really between Consumer Products and Parks and Resorts. And then we looked at creating essentially a global platform of distribution business that would include technology and would ultimately leverage the technologies that exist across the globe and across our current businesses, but then factor in the technologies that exist in the assets that we are acquiring. And it seemed to make sense that international become part of that part because as part of the acquisition there are two big platforms, Sky and Star, that are part of that. And so, if this acquisition happens, it seemed to make sense that the international assets and I'll call the platform assets are in one business. So there's just a lot of efficiencies in managing the way we take all this IP to customers around the world. It's our intention to create great user experience and in an efficient way, not only with our moving the content to people, but an effective way of monetizing it. And it really dovetails with exactly why we're interested in these assets, which is to continue as a company to invest and then to create great products and experiences around the world, to invest in great technology, to make it more modern and more innovative in terms of how customers interface with it, and diversify the company internationally.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Thank you, Bob.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Michael, thank you. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Alexia from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Thank you very much. On the Studio side, Avengers has been such a huge home run. I guess is there any opportunity for another content cycle on the conclusion of the series after the next film? Or maybe just any color you can provide, in general, on your confidence this incredible Marvel success can continue?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Well, we've got right now the Marvel films that we've announced is we have Ant-Man and The Wasp coming up, and then we have Captain Marvel, and then we have the fourth installment of Avengers which will be May of 2019. We meet on a regular basis with our Marvel team, and we plotted out Marvel movies that will take us well into the next decade. We're confident that with the 7,000 some odd characters that are part of the Marvel universe that there's plenty stories and characters to mine from and have some great ideas. I'm guessing that we will try our hand at what I'll call a new franchise beyond Avengers, but it doesn't necessarily mean that you won't see more Avengers down the road. We just haven't made any announcements about that. The goal, of course, was for the fourth Avengers series to have a significant conclusion. But given the popularity of the characters and given the popularity of the franchise, I don't think people should conclude that there'll never be another Avengers movie. But there's certainly a lot more that we can \u2013 a lot more stories to tell, a lot more characters to populate those stories with.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Hey. And, Alexia, I'm going to add just a comment on Avengers. I think the outstanding performance is nothing short of stellar. But there is one difference in this movie versus some of the others, I'll just point to the most recent one, Black Panther, and that's the size of the cast. When you think about \u2013 if you've seen it, you've seen a couple of dozen Avengers in the movie. So because of the size of the cast involved and the cost of the movie and all the special effects, the scale, the magnitude, while this film is going to be very profitable, it may not be at the same return level of some of the other films just because of the sheer scale of it.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I guess just jumping on that point when you talk about the size of the cast, how should we think about maybe the CP opportunity given the success and you do have so many characters in the movie.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: For Consumer Products, this was one of four Marvel releases this year along with Thor, Black Panther and, as Bob mentioned, the upcoming Ant-Man. But this is the largest property from a Consumer Products perspective, so we do expect this to perform well for the balance of the year.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: All right. Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Alexia. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMarci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks. I have two questions. The first, can you talk about your marketing strategy around the launch of ESPN+? I know there's been a lot of concern in the market about upfront cost for both ESPN+ and for the Disney DTC app. So anything we can glean on at least marketing around that? And then, secondly, can you remind us how big Toy Story Land Shanghai is relative to the Shanghai Park and maybe your expectations for what this can do, either drive attendance or have people stay longer? Thank you.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: The marketing strategy for ESPN+ is relatively modest in nature. We have primarily resorted to using time and the marketing opportunity on the ESPN platforms, including the channels, the magazine, the websites, and the existing app. ESPN Digital is the most popular sports digital product out there. It dwarfs some of the competition, and that gave us ample opportunity to promote basically what is a new app experience. So the marketing costs are modest. There is some investment in additional programming prior to launch, but we made more investment with the announcement of UFC. That doesn't come until 2019, and we're going to continue to invest in product to make ESPN+ a real digital sports marketplace. We're not going to give you specifics about the size of the Toy Story Land, but it marked a substantial increase or expansion of that park, building a new land. It's not as large, by the way, as the Toy Story Land that we're opening this summer in Orlando. But having been there last week, it's sizable in nature. It's got some great attractions, retail and dining experiences. And, I'll call it, it makes a dent in terms of scale of the park. But we have ample opportunity to grow Shanghai Disneyland beyond what we've already built.\nMarci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Marci. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.\nTodd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, thanks a lot. One on advertising and one on content probably, I guess, for Christine maybe. Thank you, as always, for the pacing number on ESPN. I was hoping maybe you'd be willing just to decompose that just a little bit in rough terms for us. I mean, especially with the NBA seeming so strong in both audience and looks like more games this year. One would think that that would be a strong positive contributor to year-over-year growth. Pacing is, I think, you said minus 1%. Makes you wonder what the downs are. And one thinks of SportsCenter and all the hours particularly related to that. So I'm not looking for specifics here, but if you could help maybe dimensionalize the positive and negative contributors, that would be awesome? Bob, I'll try and make this faster. On the content for the entertainment direct-to-consumer, you've talked many times in this call about the original content that you have in your mind and you're going to share with us I know over the coming months. You didn't talk much about the library content, both at Disney or at Fox, as currently contemplated. What are your current thoughts, if you don't mind sharing them on the importance in the role of that library content, especially TV product, in your entertainment service, especially relative to the revenue it generates in traditional syndication? And do you think it's okay to be in both places or is it important to be exclusive to your service? And when and where that makes sense? Thanks.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay. Todd, I'll take the advertising question first for ESPN. In my comments I did mention that quarter-to-date it was pacing down 1%. That was rounded up to 1%. So where we are with the NBA Finals with the teams that are remaining and what we anticipate being the Eastern Conference Final, we feel really good about the prospects of advertising performing well in the balance of this quarter.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: On the content side, we are fully committed, and I want to emphasize the use of the word fully, to not only bringing this product out to market, but making sure its success long-term. Long-term is the operative word to use here. Because in order for this to be successful long-term, it has to become the destination to watch Disney, Marvel, Star Wars and Pixar product. And that means, ultimately, winning ourselves of product being available any other place except for the current linear channels that are in the marketplace. So this will become the destination globally for our movie library and our television library. And we certainly hope to augment the product with some of the product we will be buying with the 21st Century Fox acquisition, Nat Geo comes to mind as a perfect opportunity for what would be a more family-oriented app. But we are committed to this working and that will mean both making product that is original for this app, but also migrating all of our other product that exists on many other platforms that are distributed and monetized by third parties available on an exclusive basis through this app.\nTodd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Very helpful. Thanks.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Todd, thanks for the question.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay. Thank you, Todd. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question in the queue comes from Steven Cahall from Royal Bank of Canada.\nSteven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah. Thank you. Two for me. Bob, one for you and then one for Christine. Bob, I was just wondering if you could maybe reiterate how you view the strategic fit of Sky in the overall portfolio. To some of us Sky maybe always looked like it was a little different than the rest of what you were buying with Fox. And now that things have changed there with the counter offer on Sky, I was just wondering if you could help us put that all into the context of your strategy. And then, Christine, you had a really strong quarter for free cash flow. I think pension might have helped and your buyback cadence has been running a little lower. We're probably still in line with guidance, so just any update you might give us on what the buyback might look like this year? Thanks.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Look, we are buying the 39% of Sky that is part of 21st Century Fox's assets, and we know they're attempting to buy the remaining 61% that should they be successful we would step into their shoes and on the whole thing. We value Sky, obviously. We're certainly impressed by the talent that is there and the quality of the product. Actually, we're particularly impressed with the quality of their customer experience, the user experience and the customer service they provide. And that's certainly something that Disney can appreciate, given our record of providing high-quality customer service. I'm not going to anyway quantify what the strategic fit is except to say that in today's world a platform that can bring product to consumers in very, very user-friendly and effective ways and then to monetize this in the process is something that we believe is attractive. And we're not going to provide any update. And your other question, we've got \u2013 I don't think we've got \u2013 we're not going to address that.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: No. You're absolutely right that free cash flow is very strong. But what we've said is that we would buy 10 billion by the time that the Fox transaction closed. But as it relates to this year, we've got no change to make it this time.\nSteven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: John, thank you for the question. Operator, we'll take one more question.\nOperator: The next question in the queue, sir, comes from Kannan from Barclays. Your line is open.\nKannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Just a couple from me. First is, in terms of the investments on OTT, just wanted to figure out how much of the cost is already in the systems, especially when it comes to things like technology now that ESPN+ is live? And how much remains to be done? And then, Bob, from your perspective, when you look at a product like ESPN+, can that at some point become an aggregator itself in the sense that you could put together a bundle of sports networks and provide it through ESPN+ instead of just having content that you own? Thanks.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Yes, Kannan. On the first question, the technology, when we acquired BAMTech, that provided us with a technology that we needed to launch ESPN+. And so, the cost associated with that \u2013 we were quite transparent when we announced the deal and the cost associated with that. And Christine actually commented about them I think in her earnings call are already baked into this from a technology perspective. And then on the second part of the question, our goal here is to create a sports marketplace on ESPN+ and that will include a number of sports that we've already licensed and sports that we are in the process of licensing, including the deal that we announced today, as well as some of the sports that we would be acquiring as part of the 21st Century Fox acquisition and then there are opportunities to license beyond what we've already done.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Yeah, Kannan. Just to put some numbers around the technology investment, and this is BAMTech total, but a lot of this is for their technology platforms. Back in November, we told you that it would have an impact on 2018 of about $130 million and we have said that that will now be $50 million more. So the estimate for the full year was $180 million, and $100 million of that will be next quarter. But a lot of that is technology investment among other expenses related to BAMTech.\nKannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right.

Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and a replay and transcript will be available on our website. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob will lead off, followed by Christine. And we'll then, of course, be happy to take some questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to the Bob and we'll get started.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Low, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we discuss the quarter and other developments across the company, a quick update about our recently announced acquisition. The regulatory process has begun in numerous jurisdictions across the world. And I spent the last several weeks meeting with a number of business leaders at Fox, gaining insight that will be invaluable when it comes to integrating our organizations once we have regulatory approval. After these discussions, I'm even more enthusiastic about the businesses we're acquiring and the management teams that are leading them. As we said, when we announced this deal, there are three primary strategic priorities fulfilled by this acquisition. It will deliver more content and the production capabilities and talent to produce even more. It will enhance our direct-to-consumer initiatives with platforms, technologies, brands and existing customer relationships to build on. And it will greatly diversify our businesses geographically. All three of these elements sync up perfectly with our own core strategies, and all three are designed to create growth in a very dynamic global marketplace. As that process moves forward, there are numerous new initiatives and projects underway and I'd like to update you on a few of them. As you recall, some months ago, we announced our intention to develop and launch an ESPN direct-to-consumer business. This new business will launch sometime this spring when we unveil a completely re-conceived and redesigned ESPN app which will deliver important new services and experiences to users. The changes will be dramatic, with more compelling visuals, as well as an easy, intuitive interface and exceptional video and sound quality. Users will also enjoy an increasingly personalized experience as the app blends explicit choices with implicit behavior to curate a unique mix of specific, relevant content tailored to the taste of each individual user. This one app approach will deliver three main features. It will provide countless scores and highlights, as well as podcasts and other sports information with a more user-friendly mobile interface. It will enable access to live streams of all ESPN's networks providing consumers or subscribers to multi-channel packages. And it will feature our new ESPN Plus subscription service. Powered by BAMTech's proprietary technology, the service will offer a greatly expanded array of programs and live events for sports fans who want even more content, as well as for fans interested in sports and events not currently featured on the main channels. This subscription service will feature thousands of additional live events, giving fans access to more leagues, more teams and more games than ever before, including Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer and the NHL, along with a rich array of college sports, as well as Grand Slam Tennis, Boxing, Golf, Rugby and Cricket, that aren't available on the ESPN linear networks. Additionally, ESPN Plus will feature the full library of ESPN Films, including the highly acclaimed 30 for 30 documentary series; and we're also creating a robust slate of high-quality original content exclusively for this platform. As I noted earlier, we'll introduce this new app with its direct-to-consumer component this spring, and we're pricing ESPN Plus at $4.99 per month. It will be available on a variety of platforms at the time of launch, including iOS, Android, tvOS, Chromecast, with more to follow. We're very excited to bring this product to market, an opportunity created by our BAMTech acquisition. We plan to invest further in the direct-to-consumer feature, adding more live games and produce sports programming, along with even greater personalization in the years ahead. Our upcoming Disney DTC service will also combine the full range of BAMTech's capabilities with some of the world's most popular IP to deliver a compelling consumer experience when it launches in late 2019. Turning to our Studio, we're just days away from the highly anticipated release of Black Panther, which opens on February 16; and the buzz is palpable. At the moment, ticket pre-sales are outpacing every other superhero movie ever made, driven in part by the phenomenal reaction to the premier last week. Marvel continues to defy expectations and redefine the superhero genre with each new release, constantly raising the bar with stories and characters that are fresh, compelling, and spectacular. Black Panther is a great example, and we're thrilled with the attention and accolade its receiving. It's exciting to see such tremendous enthusiasm for this film and its brilliant diverse cast. We've got a strong pipeline of major releases to follow, including the March 9 debut of Disney's A Wrinkle in Time directed by Ava DuVernay and starring Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, and Mindy Kaling. Our next Marvel movie of fiscal 2018, Avengers: Infinity War, will showcase the largest collection of Marvel characters ever seen on screen when it opens May 4. And we'll release our second stand-alone Star Wars movie on May 25. The world got its first glimpse at Solo: A Star Wars Story this week; thanks to our Super Bowl ad. And we followed that with the release of the movie's first trailer yesterday. The reaction has been fantastic. Han Solo is one of the most iconic and beloved characters in the Star Wars universe, and there's clearly a lot of interest in his origin story. And the future of the Star Wars franchise just got even more exciting. In addition to next year's Episode IX and the trilogy Rian Johnson is developing for us, we just announced that David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, creators of the epic Game of Thrones series, will write and produce a new series of original Star Wars films. Turning to Pixar, we released the Incredibles in 2004, and it remains one of the most popular Pixar films ever made. Its legions of fans around the world will be rewarded for their devotion and their patience when we release the long-awaited sequel, Incredibles 2, on June 15. Our release slate for the rest of 2018, 2019 and beyond is equally strong, and we'll talk more about those films on future calls. I also want to highlight our Parks and Resorts business, which continues to successfully leverage our incredible collection of IP to create and deliver an exceptional entertainment experience for millions of guests, as evidenced by their performance in Q1, all of which deepens our confidence in the significant investments we're making to grow the business around the world, including commissioning three new cruise ships to expand our award-winning fleet, adding Toy Story Lands in Shanghai and Orlando, building Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge in Disneyland and Disney World, and preparing to incorporate more of our popular IP into Disneyland Paris. The investments we've made in IP in addition to the numerous investments we've made across the world in our Parks and Resorts businesses have driven dramatic growth over the last decade, and we're confident this trend will continue well into the future. I'm going to turn the call over to Christine to talk about the details of our results in the quarter, and then we'll take your questions. Christine?\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, most notably a one-time $1.6 billion benefit associated with tax reform, earnings per share for the first fiscal quarter were up 22% to $1.89. This $1.89 includes a $0.22 benefit from a lower federal tax rate in fiscal 2018. Given our September fiscal year-end, our fiscal 2018 federal tax rate is 24.5%. Turning to segment results, Parks and Resorts delivered another strong quarter of financial performance. Operating income increased 21% due to growth at our domestic operations and Disneyland Paris. I'll note the year-over-year growth reflects the unfavorable impact of Hurricane Matthew and a dry-dock at Disney Cruise Line during Q1 last year. At our domestic operations, operating income was up 18% over prior year, driven by higher results at domestic parks and resorts and growth at Disney Cruise Line and Disney Vacation Club. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 6% in the quarter as Pandora \u2013 The World of Avatar, contributed to record attendance at Disney's Animal Kingdom and Walt Disney World overall; and Guardians of the Galaxy \u2013 Mission: BREAKOUT! contributed to higher attendance at Disneyland Resort. Per capita spending was up 7% on higher admissions, food and beverage, and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 6% and occupancy was comparable to last year at 91%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 3% compared to prior year despite reduced room inventory due to conversions and ongoing room refurbishments. Booked rates are pacing up 13%, which reflects our strategy of improving the guest experience through better load-balancing of attendance throughout the year, as well as the benefit of one week of the Easter holiday falling in Q2 this year, whereas the two-week holiday period fell entirely in Q3 last year. We estimate the timing of the Easter holiday period will shift approximately $35 million in operating income from Q3 to Q2. This benefit will be partially offset by the impact of a 14-day dry-dock of the Disney Magic, which will adversely affect Disney Cruise Line's operating income by about $20 million. I'll also note, Disneyland Paris continued to benefit from the resort's 25th anniversary celebration which drove higher attendance, guest spending and hotel occupancy. The resort set a new Q1 record in revenue and has now been profitable for the last three quarters, so we are very pleased with the progress we're making there. Total segment operating income margin was 26.1%, up 170 basis points compared to Q1 last year and represents the highest quarterly margin for the segment since 2004 when we began consolidating our international parks. At Media Networks, operating income declined during the first quarter, primarily due to lower results at broadcasting and lower equity income. At broadcasting, we continued to see nice double-digit growth in affiliate revenue. However, that was more than offset by lower advertising revenue, higher programming costs and lower operating income from program sales. The year-over-year decline in advertising revenue reflects lower political advertising at our owned stations and lower ad revenue at the ABC Network, where higher rates were offset by a decline in impressions. Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 30% above upfront levels. Equity income was lower in the quarter due to higher losses at Hulu and lower income at A+E Television Networks, partially offset by the absence of equity losses from our investment in BAMTech. I'll note that due to our increased stake in BAMTech, BAMTech's results are now consolidated within Cable Networks. At cable, growth at Disney Channels and Freeform was offset by losses at BAMTech and lower results at ESPN. At ESPN, growth in affiliate revenue and lower programming expenses were offset by lower advertising revenue. Lower programming expense was primarily driven by the timing of the two College Football Playoff semifinal bowl games, which shifted out of Q1 this year into Q2, partially offset by contractual rate increases for college sports and NFL programming. Ad revenue at ESPN was down 11% in the quarter, reflecting a decrease in impressions and lower rates, which were adversely impacted by the timing of the College Football Playoff semifinal bowl games. Like last year, ESPN aired three of the new year's six bowl games during the first quarter. However, this year, the two semifinal games aired during the second quarter. We estimate Q1 ad revenue was down 7%, excluding the impact of the two semifinal bowl games shifting into Q2 this year. So far this quarter, ESPN's cash ad sales pacing is comparable to last year and reflects the timing benefit of the two semifinal bowl games. Total Media Networks' affiliate revenue was up 4% in the quarter due to growth at both cable and broadcasting. Higher affiliate revenue was driven by seven points of growth due to higher rates, partially offset by about a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. At the Studio, first quarter results were modestly lower compared to last year as growth in theatrical distribution was offset by lower operating income in our home entertainment and television distribution businesses. Our theatrical business had another solid quarter due to the strong performances of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Thor: Ragnarok, and Coco. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is our third Star Wars film. And through today, these three films have collectively generated over $4.4 billion in global box office. Lower home entertainment operating income reflects lower unit sales, driven by the strong performance of Finding Dory last year compared to Cars 3 in Q1 this year. Lower television distribution results were primarily due to a decrease in pay television driven by the domestic availability of two key titles in Q1 last year, Captain America: Civil War and Jungle Book, compared to one key title, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 in Q1 this year. At Consumer Products & Interactive Media, lower segment operating income in the quarter was driven by a decrease in merchandise licensing, partially offset by the growth in our games business due to the performance of Star Wars Battlefront II. During the first quarter, we repurchased 12.8 million shares for $1.3 billion. And, year-to-date, we've repurchased 17.6 million shares for approximately $1.8 billion. Earlier, I quantified two impacts of tax reform to our Q1 results: first, the $1.6 billion one-time net benefit driven primarily by the revaluation of our deferred tax liability; and, second, a $0.22 benefit in the quarter due to the lower statutory rate. As I mentioned earlier, our applicable federal statutory tax rate is 24.5% for fiscal 2018. For future years, the federal tax rate will be 21%. In recent years, our effective tax rate has closely mirrored the statutory rate, and we continue to expect that to be the case going forward. As we look to the second quarter, there are a few factors I'd like to highlight that will influence Q2 comparisons. We expect cable expense growth to be up mid-teens, reflecting the consolidation of BAMTech and higher programming expenses at ESPN, primarily due to the timing of the College Football semifinal games. There is no change in our full-year cable expense growth forecast of high-single digits, driven by BAMTech; and up low-single digits on a comparable basis. At broadcasting, results will reflect a $55 million decline in operating income from program sales due largely to the timing of domestic SVOD in international sales. At the Studio, I'll remind you, we had a very strong second quarter last year due to the performance of Beauty and the Beast and the carryover performance of Rogue One and Moana. We also have two releases this quarter versus one in the prior year, which will drive higher marketing expenses. So while we are excited about the release of Black Panther and A Wrinkle in Time, these factors create a very difficult comparison at Studio Entertainment. And, finally, last month we announced a one-time bonus to 125,000 cast members. We expect roughly half of the forecasted expense or about $55 million to fall in the second quarter, with roughly $40 million recorded at Parks and Resorts. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell for Q&A.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: All right. Thanks, Christine. Once again, I want to apologize for the late start. We had issue with our vendor's network, and I think that's why some of you had difficulty dialing in. We're glad you're now with us. And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: And thank you so much. Our first question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Bob, could you talk a little more about the ESPN product coming to market? Particularly, what are you doing behind the scenes on the technology side and in terms of personalization to really change what the consumer experiences and how does that translate eventually to the large screen? You talked about a mobile UI. But obviously sitting back on the couch and watching live events on a large screen is a big part of the sports experience. So is this also being built to grow and be engaged with on the big screen? And then, Christine, just if I could come back to tax for a second. Do you have any guidance for us on cash taxes? And I'm wondering, in particular, whether your capital spending will qualify for accelerated depreciation, particularly at the Parks, given the changes in the tax law? Thank you both.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: So the technological guts behind the entire ESPN online or app experience is being completely redone. And so, the app that we are launching sometime this spring \u2013 we didn't give a specific date \u2013 will be a completely new app. The app itself will have three primary features, as I've been saying. But I'll go over them one more time because I want to drill down on a couple of them. The first is the obvious; it'll have tons of scores and highlights and new stories about sports. And that will be highly personalized, both implicit and explicit. So it's going to use the BAMTech engine, data collection, data management and all of the bells and whistles from a personalization, customization perspective that that can provide. That will, by the way, be evidenced in both video, as well as basically the written word that's presented, the stories that are presented, customizable obviously by teams, by locations, by general interest. But also basically machine learning elements of it will enable the app to determine what someone is interested in and feed them more of that as they use the app more. The second feature is live streaming of the networks themselves. That's under authenticated circumstances. And so, if you are a subscriber to an existing service or if you want to subscribe in the future, you'll be able to use that to stream ESPN1, ESPN2, ESPNU, et cetera. There, if you want to watch it on a small screen, a mobile screen, obviously the app will provide that. The Watch app today does that. But you can also, as you know, use a variety of different devices. I happen to use Apple TV or I AirPlay. I use Apple TV to access the app, but you can also AirPlay it directly from your mobile device to a large television. And then, of course, the third feature is going to be this Plus feature, we're actually calling it ESPN Plus, because it's offering an incremental thousands of hours of live sports programming basically to the ESPN experience. And then, in addition to that, that would be the home of the 30 for 30 series; the entire library of 30 for 30 product will be on there. And we'll continue to invest in original and exclusive content just for the app. So it's a three-in-one, completely new experience, new technology, and it will basically enable people to access ESPN just about any way imaginable. And we're not only excited about it, but, if anything, points to what the future of ESPN looks like, it'll be this app and the experience that it provides.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay, Ben, your question regarding cash taxes. In the last few years, our cash taxes have generally been a little lower than our book taxes, and we expect the cash taxes to continue to be somewhat lower than book taxes over the next few years. And that's due in part to the accelerated cost recovery of U.S. investments, the most significant of which would be in our parks and also for film and television production. And I just want to point out that that accelerated cost recovery is set to phase out after five years. Most of our domestic parks assets will be eligible for full expensing at the time they go into service.\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's helpful. Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay, Ben. Thanks. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: And thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with Moffett.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Thanks. Bob, I have two for you. One is, could you talk a bit now that BAMTech is integrated into Disney, how is it being run? Is it a separate division that kind of sets OTT strategy? Or is it integrated into Media Networks, where the strategy is set by maybe operating divisions? And does that change when you acquire Fox? And, secondly, when you talk about Lucasfilm hiring Benioff and Weiss, who have an amazing track record, why not focus that energy on making a serialized drama that maybe works better for SVOD and builds value over time versus films. How do you think about the allocation of their talent versus film versus TV?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: BAMTech is part of our Media Networks, because it's Media Networks that BAMTech is primarily providing services to. And so, it will power a number of different sort of go-to-consumer experiences. And I can't really say what we will do post regulatory approval on the Fox acquisition. We're looking at a number of different organizational opportunities in terms of how we structure. And, clearly, we're interested in some form of conformity when it comes to technology. When I mean conformity, I just mean basically being more efficient and being more consistent and using basically our best talent and the best technology that we have across as many businesses as possible. In terms of how the product is actually created, BAMTech largely is responsible for the technological underpinning on audience management, to some extent some sales as well, because they have a lot of experience not just in how to create these experiences, it's also collecting user data, managing customer acquisition, customer retention, billing, and then all the necessary dynamics or technology needed for far more dynamic advertising opportunities and experiences. And so, the editorial side of ESPN will still flow through ESPN, work in conjunction with BAMTech. But the technology side is largely BAMTech's responsibility. On Lucasfilm question you asked and Benioff and Weiss, their interest was in creating a series of films that are Star Wars based. And we've actually been talking to them for a long time. To my knowledge, they didn't express interest in creating a series. But they have an idea about a number of films at some later date, I'm sure we'll disclose to all of you just what those are. They're focused on a point in time in the Star Wars mythology and taking it from there. We are developing not just one, but a few Star Wars series, specifically for the Disney direct-to-consumer app. We've mentioned that and we're close to being able to reveal at least one of the entities that's developing that for us. But because the deal isn't completely closed, we can't be specific about that. But we are pleased with the level of interest among the creative community in creating not just Star Wars, but other series for this Disney app. And I think you'll find that the level of talent that will be on, if you call it, the television front will be rather significant as well.\nMichael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC: Okay. Thanks, Bob.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thank you, Michael. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif with Bank of America.\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Just a couple. First, Bob, you kind of alluded to some of the positives of Fox besides the cost that you guys outlined in the past. Can you talk about how you're thinking about some of the revenue benefits from integrating Fox, particularly on the production side? And then on the theme parks side, can you give us any color on Toy Story Lands? How big it will be, meaning number of attractions, rides? And would you think of it the way \u2013 in terms of impact the, way Cars Land or Pandora impacted, like lower attended gates, will it even out attendance? How are you thinking about it?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: I'll start with the second part. We're building two Toy Story Lands. One will open in late April in Shanghai. We broke ground on that, I think, actually before we actually opened Shanghai. And the other one is being built in Orlando. And that will be opened some point later this year, but we have not announced a date. And they're both large lands, they're not as large as the Star Wars Lands that we're building. I'm not 100% sure how they compare in size to Cars Land, but they all will have multiple attractions and other experiences. And given the fact that that franchise is still quite popular and we're making a fourth Toy Story film that comes out in 2019, we feel good about it. They're large in size, 10 acres I'm being told versus 13 acres for Cars Land. So they are not quite as large, but they're large enough. We feel good about that. And they'll have very, very distinct IP from Toy Story. So in other words, people will know exactly what the experience is going to be. We basically immerse you in a toy world. To your first question, I think the way to look at the revenue opportunities, as particularly as it relates to production, is to consider the fact that what we're buying here is significant production capabilities and, with that, the talent to produce on our behalf. The production or the output that we're buying from those entities will flow through our studio in both the tent-pole movie direction, but also in, we'll call it, specialty movie direction, the Fox 2000 and the Fox Searchlight businesses, as a for instance. And there is also capability there to make films for direct-to-consumer experiences. In addition to that, Fox has had significant success on the television studio front, Modern Family, This is Us, two very specific examples of that, as well as on the FX studio front, where they produce a number of the series that are on FX. And so, we will, as a company, when combined, have far more production and obviously production capability to flow into our traditional distribution businesses, that being TV channels and the motion picture exhibition business, as well as the capability to create product for our direct-to-consumer businesses. And we're really \u2013 and this is \u2013 I think needs to be considered on a global basis. So this, obviously, is application well beyond just domestic consumption or domestic distribution platforms.\nJessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Jessica. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Yes. Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Thank you. Bob, just on the Studio, you guys have been such a stand-out in the box office this past few years and the pipeline continues to look so strong given the tracking early reviews of Black Panther. I guess, how should we think about the value of the Studio output deal in terms of a differentiator or driver for the Disney streaming when you launch in 2019? And does that become even more meaningful as the home entertainment window continues to wane? And then, Christine, just a follow-up. Last quarter, I believe you said you expect Hulu to be about $100 million worse in fiscal 2018 than last year. Is that still a good number to use?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: So, Alexia, as you know, the Netflix output deal expires with the 2018 slate. They will have rights to the films that were made in 2016, 2017, 2018 for quite a long period of time thereafter with a window for us to use them ourselves that falls within the period of time or the tail that they'll have those rights. The films that our studio makes in 2019 and beyond will be sub-licensed or licensed to our own platform, and that will include the Marvel, Pixar, Disney and Lucasfilm films. And we'll talk at a later date about our intentions regarding the Fox studio output, but obviously Hulu is a possibility in that regard. But they have been existing output deal already with HBO that will last longer than by a few years the deal that we have with Netflix. But it's ultimately our intention, and this acquisition clearly will enable this even more, to create and to ultimately grow a global direct-to-consumer business that will take advantage of the production output that the combined companies will have, whether it's on the television side or on the network side. And we fully hope to actually expand our production of intellectual property under those different umbrellas, Studio and Television, to feed multiple channels and in particular direct-to-consumer businesses that we own.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Alexia, thanks for the question on Hulu. You're right that we said at our November year-end call that we expected Hulu to come up with about a $100 million greater loss year-over-year. And we now expect that equity loss for the year to be approximately $250 million higher than last year. And the best way to think about that, how it's going to fall, you can expect about a third of that to impact our Q2 results. So the increase is largely related to the content licensed from Hulu's equity owners. And as one of the equity owners, our portion of these incremental costs will largely be recouped by ABC's program sales, as well as affiliate revenues to some of our various networks.\nAlexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC: All right. Thank you very much.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: All right. Thanks, Alexia. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Yes. Thank you. Our next question comes from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein.\nTodd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks. I'll take my two, if you'll indulge me. It's going to be the farthest you made it through an earnings calls in years without somebody asking about pay-TV subs. So I'm sorry to do this to you, I really am, but I have to ask and it's really just a slight clarification. Bob, I think you're on CNBC after hours saying \u2013 I think you used the word that maybe industry \u2013 sub-losses for you were moderating a bit, I think. I don't want to put words into your mouth. But then, Christine, when you sort of laid out the sub-loss, I think you said minus 3% effect on cable networks, which is the same as the minus 3% last quarter. So I suppose we're just talking about rounding here in terms of a moderation, but not enough to change that number. Just wanted to confirm that because I think it's still important? And a second quick one, Christine. On the parks, you laid out a lot of things going on there, and I appreciate that. I don't think I heard Shanghai called out. I apologize if I missed it. Would love, if you could just share something on that. How is it \u2013 revenue up or down, is attendance up or down? Is OI up or down? That sort of thing. Anything you can share would be great. Thanks.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay. First, I'd like to just touch on the subs comments. So as you noted, we did a growth of 7% from contractual rates and a decrease of 3% in our sub-count for the quarter. And the 3% versus 3% is due to rounding. But I would also say that we did see a modest sequential improvement in Q1, which is the second consecutive quarter that we've seen this trend. And the growth is being driven by adoption of the digital MVPD platforms.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: And just to add to that, Todd. What we're seeing is very encouraging in terms of the digital platforms. I mentioned on the CNBC interview that we're noticing that people are coming into the basically multi-channel world or subscribing that we've previously considered cord-nevers. Clearly there lower price, the fewer channels and the more sort of mobile-first and improved basically user experience, are all having an impact on attracting new consumers. And we believe the trends in terms of growth in the new over-the-top or digital platforms will continue. And, hopefully, they'll continue to offset because the growth is getting compelling. The loss is on the traditional side. On the Shanghai front, I think there are a few things. We didn't note it because Shanghai has had just a great year, including some days where they just had unbelievable records, well over I think 65,000, 68,000 in attendance on one day in October. And the comparisons to a year ago are relatively similar, because we've had just a great year consistently. It was announced in December that we're taking our prices up. We're actually going to a three-tier pricing strategy. And that will have some impact on the bottom line going forward, provided attendance continues to be strong, which we fully expect it will. And then, we opened Toy Story Land there in late April, April 26. And so, that will represent an opportunity in terms of more capacity. And we have on the drawing board a number of other potential expansions. We've got some discussions underway with our partners there to address some of that in the months and then, of course, the years ahead. But Shanghai is doing quite well.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: And, Todd, I'll just add a little bit more of year-over-year comparisons for Shanghai. And once again, the parks had such a strong quarter. We had so many records in quarterly OI and revenue numbers. Shanghai, not to not pay attention to them, but they too had growth. They had growth in attendance, guest spending, revenue and operating income. And the new pricing system that Bob referenced does take place on June six.\nTodd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thank you, Todd. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Cahall with Royal Bank of Canada.\nSteven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah. Thank you. So my question is just kind of on how you're going to use some of your incremental cash flow you've got from tax reform, both the rate going down and the accelerated depreciation, and you've talked about a couple of billion synergies with the transaction. And then, Bob, you said you're looking to create and grow a global direct-to-consumer business, and your biggest competitor there just continues to increase the amount of cash they're spending on original content. So when we think about some of the incremental cash that you're going to have at hand, how do you think about how many billions of that you need to put back into these direct-to-consumer enterprises to be competitive and to grow at the global scale you want to be at?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Well, in the earlier interview that I did on CNBC, I was asked a similar question. We've had a real blend in terms of how we've allocated our capital, increased dividends, continued share buybacks, actually got more aggressive in the last few years, and then investing both in acquisition and in organic growth. Theme parks being a great example of that with the expansion that we've talked about not just, by the way, Shanghai, but the expansion of every park and resort around the world and then the commitment to build three new cruise ships. And that's all benefited us greatly. As we look forward, we believe that you'll see a similar blend, except as I said earlier too, with the acquisition of 21st Century Fox, I think, you can check that box off for a while. I don't think we're going to be in the market looking to acquire for quite a long period of time. In terms of how we might allocate the other capital, I think you have to look at the film and television production as investment in organic growth. In this case, it will be aimed at growing our presence in direct-to-consumer platforms. We have not been specific yet about what incremental spend that will be. I think we were looking to say something more about that around this time of year. But since the acquisition of 21st Century Fox, that's going to shift. And until we get closer to full regulatory approval and, essentially, absorbing those assets, we're probably not likely to say something specific. What we do have that's very, very interesting that we're quite mindful of as we take these direct-to-consumer properties to market is we have the benefit of these wonderful brands. So if you look at the Disney direct-to-consumer product, which is not in the market and you haven't seen it yet, and you consider that it will be populated in terms of product by Disney, Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars product, we have an opportunity to spend more on original product, of course, but not necessarily to go in the volume direction, say, that Netflix has gone because we have this unique brand proposition. And the demand for those brands, we believe, will give us the ability to spend less on volume. Not to suggest that we're going to be low, because we obviously are going to need enough critical mass from a product perspective. But when you go to market with Star Wars movies, Disney movies, Pixar movies, Marvel branded and branded television shows under those umbrellas, in some cases using very well-known IP, we're developing a monster series, we're developing a High School Musical series, we're developing a Star Wars series, just to name a few, that will give us the ability to probably spend less than if we had gone to market with a direct-to-consumer service without these brands.\nSteven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Maybe just to follow-up with Hulu, just a similar question. Do you feel like because that is more of a broader, to use your term, volume platform, is it at the right level of original content or total content spending? Or do you see needing to be more aggressive there as well?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: No. We're a 30% owner of Hulu right now, and we have not chosen to speak on Hulu's behalf on such matters. They have been increasing not only the amount of product that they've licensed, but the amount of product that they produce and with some considerable success; Handmaid's Tale being one of the most recent example of that. So they're ramping up their volume. They're also packaging the subscription SVOD service with a multi-channel service, and that product is doing quite well. I know they mentioned that they had in excess of 17 million subs, and we're not going to update that. We'll leave it to their team, if and when they choose to do so. But that will give them the ability to continue to increase volume by going to market with a slightly different set of products, the channels being the differentiator. There's an opportunity, obviously, when we own more production capability to create more for those platforms, but we don't have anything specific to address at this point.\nSteven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: All right. Steven, Thank you. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: And thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citigroup.\nJason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Just a quick question for Ms. McCarthy. I think your studio historically has been a bit unique, in that you don't use co-financing to de-risk the business. As you think about the pro forma entity with Fox, have you all made a decision about whether or not you'll continue that practice? And if you don't, is there any sort of guidance you can tell us in terms of what the implication might be financially?\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: Well, obviously, we'll honor all deals that the Fox studios have in place. We've made no decision \u2013 this is Bob, not Ms. McCarthy, Jason. We'll assess those deals once the studio is absorbed. As a company, we've stayed away from co-financing for a variety of reasons. One, we've had plenty of access to capital at very low cost. Secondly, we've always believed that sort of in for a penny, in for a pound in the movie business. You take risk every time you make a film. But as we've proven in the last probably half a dozen years, there's considerable upside when you make them well, and we don't like sharing upside. So I think probably more likely than not that you won't see new deals, but obviously we will be respectful of and honor deals that are in place.\nJason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Understood. Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Jason. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Yes. Our next question comes from Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.\nMarci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks. Bob, you mentioned you've started conversations with your regulators as it relates to 21st Century Fox. So has this changed at all your view on timing of when the deal could close? And then, second question, any update on trends in consumer products? I know this is a bit of a sore spot due to tough comps, but any comment on potential profitability this fiscal year or any update would be great.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.: We don't really have any update on the regulatory front. We're going through the process, which is significant, because of the number of jurisdictions that we have to file in and the size and the complexity of this deal. And as much as we'd love to be at a point where we'd gain regulatory approval and we're integrating the companies, we know from the absolute beginning just how patient we have to be in this regard. So there is nothing to update you on there. You want to take the Consumer Products, Christine?\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: So in Consumer Products, this quarter, there was \u2013 and we told you about this that it was going to happen back in November, but we did have a shift from Q1 into Q2 of the timing of recognition of a minimum guarantee shortfall. And the reason that occurred was because of the way the calendar ended. The contracts end on the end of the period, which would be 12/31 and our quarter ended on December 30. So there's a shift from Q1 into Q2 which impacted their operating income this quarter. Also, I just would mention, for 2Q, when you're looking at it, we did have the benefit of some licensee settlements that we called out in our press release last year, so that's going to be a comparability factor in 2Q. But getting back to your other question on the business overall, for the balance of the year, we're very confident in our film slate in the associated IP and how it will impact our Consumer Products business. We have Star Wars: The Last Jedi out now, we'll have Solo out in the spring. We have four movies, Thor, which has already come out. The other three: Black Panther, Avengers and Ant Man and the Wasp. And this summer, we also have a highly anticipated Pixar film, Incredibles 2. So all of those things, we think, are going to bode well for the business. I'd also like to mention that Star Wars was the number one toy franchise over this past holiday period as well.\nMarci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Thanks, Marci. Operator, we're going to take one more question.\nOperator: And thank you so much. It looks like our final question comes from Barton Crockett with B. Riley FBR.\nBarton Crockett - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for taking the question. I was interested in the ad trend at ESPN, which was a little bit lighter than I was expecting. And you talked about 11% decline and 7% normalized pacing flat for the March quarter, I think, including the benefit of the game shift. And I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on what's going on there. Is that ratings-driven or is there some category that's being lost? Is it anything to do with some of the controversy around the NFL? And what would the normalized kind of pacing be in the March quarter if you adjust it for the games shift like you did in the December quarter?\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.: If you adjust it for the games, Barton, the pacing would be down a little bit. But right now, Q2 ad sales are comparable to where they were in the prior year. One of the factors that's impacting us in the sports marketplace is the Winter Olympics. It's obviously driving an increase in sports inventory, and that's one of the factors that's having an adverse impact on our ad sales in Q2.\nBarton Crockett - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Okay. That's great. Thank you.\nLowell Singer - The Walt Disney Co.: Okay. Thanks, Barton. Thanks, again, everyone for joining us today.

Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nLowell Singer: Good afternoon, and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast, and a transcript will also be available on our website. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we will be happy to take your questions.  So with that, I will turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nRobert Iger: Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. We're now just days away from launching Disney+, a combination of four years of planning, organizational transformation and a lot of hard work and we're excited to be on the verge of this new era. We're also pleased to have delivered a solid quarter which Christine will discuss shortly.  Before she does, I want to share a few thoughts about our DTC business to give you a sense of the confidence we have in our strategy and to provide a few updates. As you know, we began this process with the acquisition of BAMTech which gave us the means to implement our DTC strategy, putting us into the market quickly and ensuring we have the technology to deliver a quality experience.  Our first effort was ESPN+ which was immediate hit with sports fans when it launched last year and continues to deliver steady growth. I'm pleased to announce that as of today, ESPN+ has over 3.5 million paid subscribers, who are drawn towards unique and growing mix of original content like the legendary NFL PrimeTime with Chris Berman now exclusively on ESPN+, and exclusive live events including UFC, College Sports, domestic and international soccer, and Top Rank Boxing. The UFC 244 pay-per-view event last Saturday delivered one of the ESPN+\u2019s largest live audiences to-date. Viewing patterns show ESPN+ appeals to a broad array of sports fans, those who want more of everything, as well as fans who are highly passionate about a specific sport, conference or team. We believe we have numerous interesting opportunities to expand ESPN+'s live and original program offerings and to steadily grow subscribers.  As I've said, our acquisition of 21st Century Fox was largely driven by the value it brought to our overall DTC strategy, adding a number of critical elements including control of Hulu, which opens numerous growth opportunities domestically and internationally. We also gained a large library of quality film and television content along with additional filmmaking capabilities and the industry's best TV production studios, great talent, great brands and franchises, like Nat Geo and FX along with Simpsons and Avatar. This collection of IP and talent will contribute significantly to Disney+ and Hulu. And with that in mind, beginning in March, Hulu will become the official streaming home for FX Networks.  As I've mentioned on previous calls, FX is a producer of high-quality, award-winning content and will become a key content driver for Hulu. Since 2014, FX has earned 277 Emmy nominations and 157 Emmys. The awards FX has garnered come from programming that is recognized for its quality and its boldness. And the Hulu and FX teams have been collaborating to develop an exciting strategy to bring the full breadth of FX content and production capabilities to Hulu subscribers with the introduction of FX on Hulu. FX on Hulu will include all seasons and more than 40 FX series and will offer episodes of current and new FX series immediately after the air on the linear network.  Additionally, FX will produce original series exclusively for FX on Hulu, starting with four new series in 2020; Devs from Alex Garland, Mrs. America starring Cate Blanchett, A Teacher starring Kate Mara, and The Old Man starring Jeff Bridges and John Lithgow. This is a great way to expand the FX brand and an important step for Hulu as it adds original content to compete more aggressively with new and legacy DTC platforms.  The FX presence on Hulu combined with original production from our ABC and Fox Television Studios and our Fox Movie Studios including Searchlight will greatly enhance Hulu's consumer proposition.  Turning to Disney+, in preparation for the U.S. launch, we tested the technology in the Netherlands, giving consumers free access to a curated collection of library content, and we've been very pleased with the results, including the technical soundness and reliability of the platform. The user feedback has been extremely positive with praise for the elegance and ease of the interface and the quality of the overall experience. The ability to download the content has also been a big hit, and the brand-centric navigation has generated an elegance and an ease of use that was well received by users. The viewing patterns in the Netherlands test were also encouraging. Even without access to our full library or any original content, the service connected with users across all four quadrants, male and female, adults and kids, driven by the breadth of our content and the affinity people of all ages have for it.  Disney+ launches in the U.S., Canada and the Netherlands next Tuesday with Australia and New Zealand coming online November 19. And today, I'm pleased to announce on March 31st, Disney+ will launch in markets across Western Europe, including the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, a number of other countries in the region. At launch, Disney+ users will have immediate access to more than 500 movies including all of our beloved titles and more than 7,500 episodes of library television content, including 30 seasons of The Simpsons. By year five, this growing collection will include more than 620 movies and more than 10,000 television episodes along with countless shorts and features.  And as planned, we first conceived this service. All creative engines across our company, including the teams at Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, National Geographic, Disney Channel, and Walt Disney Television studios are focused on creating compelling original content for Disney+. At launch, we will offer 10 original movies, specials and series exclusive to the platform, including the Mandalorian. The first live-action Star Wars series is unlike anything audience has seen before on any platform and it's a strong indication of the quality and the storytelling that will define Disney+.  We recently screened a significant portion of the first episode of the Mandalorian for press and the extremely positive reaction is driving tremendous buzz around this extraordinary series ahead of its debut on Disney+. Within a year of launch, the amount of original content on Disney+ will increase to more than 45 series, specials and movies and will expand to more than 60 original projects per year by year-five. In addition to creating a phenomenal product, we're supporting the launch of Disney+ with an unprecedented marketing campaign drawing on every existing connection The Walt Disney Company has with consumers. It's an historic effort to raise awareness and drive demand, one that reflects our all-in commitment to the strategic initiatives and our determination to launch big and scale fast. We're also very pleased with the consumer enthusiasm we're seeing, as well as the interest from partners like Verizon, which is now offering a three year Disney+ for many of its customers. Consumers can directly subscribe to the service for $6.99 a month or $69.99 a year at disneyplus.com. And starting November 12, they can access the service through a growing variety of partners and platforms including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Sony and Roku. And today we're pleased to announce additional distribution partnerships with Amazon Fire, Samsung and LG. Disney+ will also be available in a bundle with ESPN+ and ad supported Hulu for $12.99 a month. We spent the last couple of years completely transforming The Walt Disney Company making strategic acquisitions and organizational changes to focus the resources and immense creativity across the entire company on delivering an extraordinary DTC experience unlike anything else in the market. With the launch of Disney+, we're making a huge statement about the future of media and entertainment and our continued ability to thrive in this new era.  I'd like to take this opportunity to publicly acknowledge and sincerely thank the technical and creative teams along with countless others across our company who invested their tremendous talent and a lot of time and effort in creating an exceptional DTC experience that is worthy of the Disney name. I talk a lot about the inevitability of change our ability to both drive it and adapt to it. It's part of Disney's DNA and it helps keep us relevant to each new generation while also creating new opportunities for growth. It's exciting and exhilarating. And on the eve of launching one of our most ambitious initiatives to-date, I am more confident than ever in our strategy and in our ability to execute effectively to deliver compelling value to our consumers and shareholders. I'm going to turn the call over to Christine to talk about our performance in the quarter and then we'll take your questions. Christine?\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter were $1.07. We are pleased with our results this quarter and how we closed out the fiscal year. Our core businesses delivered another solid year of financial performance, we continue to make meaningful progress in integrating the 21CF businesses, while making significant investments to drive future growth. Our studio had another great quarter and a phenomenal year. In the fourth quarter, operating income was up 79%, driven by growth in worldwide theatrical due to the performance of the Lion King, Toy Story 4 and Aladdin in the quarter compared to Incredibles 2, and Ant-Man and the Wasp last year. The increase in operating income was partially offset by about a $120 million loss at the 21CF Studio business, which was driven by the performance of Ad Astra, The Art of Racing in the Rain and Dark Phoenix. The loss from the 21CF Studio business was about $100 million higher than the loss we estimate the business generated in Q4 last year. At Parks, Experiences and Products, operating income was up 17% in the quarter driven by higher results at Consumer Products and at our domestic parks and experiences business. Consumer Products operating income was up 36% due to growth in merchandise licensing, as a result of strong revenue growth from sales of Frozen and Toy Story merchandise. At Parks, our strategy of managing yield to drive greater profitability and enhance the guest experience continues to pay off. Operating income at domestic parks and experiences was up 13% driven by growth at Disneyland on higher guest spending and an increase at Disney Vacation Club.  Results at Walt Disney World were comparable to the prior-year, as increases in guest spending, occupied room nights and attendance were offset by higher costs associated with the launch of Star Wars Galaxy's Edge. Domestic parks and experiences margins were up 70 basis points in the quarter. I'll note that Hurricane Dorian had an adverse impact on Walt Disney World, which we estimate impacted the year-over-year change in domestic parks and experiences margins by about 80 basis points. Attendance at our domestic parks was comparable to the fourth quarter last year, and reflects the impact of Hurricane Dorian, which we estimate adversely impacted attendance growth by about 1 percentage point. Per capita guest spending was up 5% on higher admissions, merchandise and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 2%, and occupancy of 85% was comparable to the fourth quarter last year. Results at our international operations were comparable to the fourth quarter last year, as operating income growth at Disneyland Paris and Shanghai Disney Resort was largely offset by about a $55 million decline at Hong Kong Disneyland, as circumstances in Hong Kong have led to a significant decrease in tourism from China and other parts of Asia. And based on the trends we saw in Q4 and what we are seeing so far in Q1, we expect operating income at Hong Kong Disneyland to decline by about $80 million for Q1. If the current trends continue, we could see a full year decline of approximately $275 million versus fiscal 2019. On the domestic front, we expect Q1 revenue growth at our domestic parks and resorts to benefit from a full quarter of Star Wars Galaxy's Edge at Walt Disney World and the December opening of Rise of the Resistance at Walt Disney World. However, the revenue growth will be partially offset by meaningful cost growth driven primarily by operational expenses associated with Galaxy's Edge and higher labor expense due to the impact of higher wages under new collective bargaining agreements. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are comparable to prior year. We believe some guests are deferring to Disney Land and Walt Disney World until the complete opening of Galaxy's Edge at those respective locations. I'll note that awareness and intend to visit strong. Booked rates at our domestic hotels are currently pacing up 5% versus this time last year. Turning to Media Networks. Operating income was down 3% due to declines at cable and broadcasting, though results came in better than what we expected at the time we reported Q3 earnings. Lower cable results reflect a decrease at ESPN, partially offset by the consolidation of the 21CF cable businesses. At ESPN, higher programming and production costs driven by contractual rate increases for NFL, College Sports and MLB programming and higher marketing expenses related in part to the launch of the ACC Network more than offset growth in affiliate revenue. ESPN's domestic linear advertising revenue was down 2% in the fourth quarter and so far this quarter, ESPN's domestic cash ad sales are pacing up 3% compared to last year. At Broadcasting, results in the quarter were adversely impacted by lower program sales compared to last year. We sold two Marvel series Dare Devil and Iron Fist during Q4 last year and we didn't have comparable sales in the fourth quarter this year. We also had lower sales of Blackish in the quarter compared to last year. The difficult program sales comp coupled with higher programming expenses at the ABC Television Network and lower TV station ad revenue were largely offset by the consolidation of the 21CF broadcasting business and higher affiliate revenue. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was up modestly in the quarter, quarter-to-date prime time scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 47% above upfront levels. Total Media affiliate revenue was up 18% in the fourth quarter and reflects the consolidation of 21CF and growth at both cable and broadcasting. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by 15 points of growth from the acquisition of 21CF and 7 points from higher rates, partially offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Results at our Direct to Consumer & International segment reflect the consolidation of Hulu and ongoing investment at Disney+ and ESPN+, partially offset by the consolidation of the 21CF international cable businesses. Results at our direct to consumer businesses had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of about $600 million. ESPN+ had a little over 3.4 million paid subscribers at the end of the fourth quarter and Hulu had approximately 28.5 million paid subscribers. Overall, we are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results and with the progress we're making on integrating 21CF. The 21CF businesses we acquired excluding 21CF's stake in Hulu and net of inter-segment eliminations contributed approximately $130 million in segment operating income in the fourth quarter. Consolidating Hulu\u2019s operating losses and netting out inter-segment eliminations resulted in an adverse impact to segment operating income of about $170 million. We estimate the acquisition of 21CF and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu had a total dilutive impact on our Q4 EPS before purchase accounting of $0.47 per share. Before I conclude, I'd like to highlight a few additional items, such should help frame our fiscal 2020 first quarter and full-year results. First, we expect our Direct to Consumer & International segment to generate about $800 million in operating losses for the quarter. We expect the continued investment in our DTC services, specifically Disney+, which will launch in just a few days and the consolidation of Hulu to drive an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of our direct-to-consumer businesses of approximately $850 million. At the studio, we are very excited for the release of the much-anticipated sequel to Frozen. And the final film in the Skywalker saga Star Wars, The Rise of Skywalker. We expect the theatrical performance of these films to be key positive drivers of Studio\u2019s Q1 results. However, we expect the results to be partially offset by an operating loss of about $60 million at the 21CF film studio. While 21CF's performance will not be reflected in our prior year results, we estimate that 21CF film studio generated about $30 million and operating income during Q1 of fiscal 2019. I'll note that we don't expect a material increase in studio profitability in the first quarter from licensing the legacy Disney Studio Library to Disney+. We estimate the acquisition of 21st Century Fox and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu will have a dilutive impact on our Q1 earnings per share before purchase accounting of about $0.30 per share. We still expect the acquisition to be accretive to EPS before purchase accounting for fiscal 2021. We expect consolidated CapEx in fiscal 2020 to be $500 million higher than in the prior-year. The increase in CapEx is primarily due to increases at DTCI and Corporate. And lastly, I'll note that our fiscal 2020 calendar will contain an extra week of operations. So our Q4 and full-year results will benefit from the 53rd week. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell, and we would be happy to answer your questions.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks, Christine. And operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks, good afternoon. Bob, I want to ask you about two of the most important brands the company, Marvel and Lucas, and how we should think about the contribution of those businesses or those Studios over the next couple of years? I mean there's been a lot written about what's happening on the Star Wars fronts. I'd love to get your thoughts there and on Marvel sort of in the post Avengers world. How you think about mining that IP broadly for the company, what we should be expecting a bit of a gap period in terms of contribution over the next couple of years. And then Christine, one of the things that happens when you give us a lot of guidance as we come back to; hence, I wanted to ask you about the numbers you gave us at Investor Day for 2020 in particular around Disney+. I think you talked about $3 billion of OpEx, you talked about Hulu, peak losses of $1.5 billion '19 and ESPN+ losses of $650 million. I'm just wondering if any of those numbers we should be thinking have moved around materially or if those are still decent places to be thinking about? Thank you, guys.\nRobert Iger : Ben, when we think about those two businesses Marvel and Star Wars, we think about them as more than just films and film franchises, we look at them across multiple businesses and with different basically creative strategies in mind. So just as a, for instance, in both cases while they are continue -- it will continue to be films either in development or in production, there is a lot of activity on the television front. Star Wars has three television series, there are in varying forms of production and more in development for Disney+ and Marvel has many more so, while in the Star Wars case, Star Wars 9 which comes out this December will be the last of the Skywalker Saga, and we'll go into a hiatus for a few years before the next Star Wars feature there'll be a lot of creative activity in the interim. In Marvel's case, I'll call it in the post Avengers world, it doesn't mean there aren't films that are being made the characters from The Avengers back we have Black Widow coming out in fiscal '20, and Thor 4 movie in the works. And I could go on and on. We also are mining other characters and character like Eternals. So as we look at these businesses, they're film business and they're TV businesses, they are still big Consumer products drivers and more and more they have a greater presence of Parks and Resorts. And we feel really good about both the creative direction, but also the commercial direction.\nChristine McCarthy : And Ben, this is Christine. On the guidance question regarding the guidance that we provided in April at the Investor Day, it's fair to say that all of the guidance and that goes across the three platforms, Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu is still as it was. We haven't made any changes to that. And having gone through the planning process for fiscal '20 we feel really good about fiscal '20 and achieving the goals that we've set.\nBen Swinburne : Great, thank you.\nLowell Singer: Thank you, Ben. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAlexia Quadrani : Hi, thank you so much. Just two questions on the streaming side, if I may. First, any color you can provide on the early sign ups and Disney+ for the large even just sort of general color, not necessarily numbers for -- I'm doubtful you might so early on. And then if you can talk about the advertising opportunity of some of your other streaming services, specifically Hulu, where you're seeing a really meaningful scale now and ESPN+, which also has seen such great growth, I think you've also recent increase the pre-roll ad loads there. I guess how meaningful can the advertising side become for you guys?\nRobert Iger : Well, Hulu is a significant driver of advertising revenue and we will continue to be particularly, as we grow Hulu out to essentially the guidance that we had given back in Investor Day, that basically ad supported Hulu has very high ARPU, which is one of the reasons, Alexia, that it's being bundled with ESPN+ and Disney+ for that $12.99 price, because the value of an ad supported Hulu subscriber given the advertising revenue that it drives is very, very high. ESPN, there are also opportunities for growth, but probably the biggest opportunity is on the Hulu front. On your first question, just in terms of color regarding Disney+ and presales, we're not giving any specifics. Consumers were drawn to basically the marketing messages that we had out there, which is a reaction to the brands and the content both library product and original product that's coming. Clearly, the price was met with a great enthusiasm one consumers, not just the single month price but I guess what we are really selling was the three-year subscription, which is a big deal for us in terms of lowering churn. We're still relatively small in terms of the scope of things in terms of number of subscribers. But I think the best way for me to characterize it would be to say that we are enthusiastic about what we saw the consumer reaction to be. We certainly feel good about the product that's going into the marketplace next week and we'll know a lot more in just a few days. But it was good. And I should also say I said in my comments, the Netherlands launch was also very, very positive. And what was positive there were a few things, not just the fact that there was an enthusiasm for the service, but we had a good sense about how people were using it and what people were using it. The demographics were far broader than a lot of people expected them to be. This is well beyond kids and family, clearly where this is a four quadrant product, with adult men and women as well as kids families watching or using the service. We also saw that people's interest in the product itself was very, very broad meaning across all of the brands, wasn't a specific and that also bodes very well, and we learn that some of the features including the 4K , the HDR movies we're very, very popular. The fact that you can have four concurrent live streams also very popular, the personalization was also quite popular and most importantly, the ability to download without restriction was very, very popular.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer: Alexia, thanks for the questions. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nMichael Nathanson : Thanks, Bob. A couple on Hulu. I guess I guess scripted comments today you referred to maybe as of Fox Searchlight product the movies is going to Hulu. I wondered, does that represent where all the movies come from this point on. Is that a strategic shift for Fox studio and the film side? And the second question is, you also in the comments I mentioned international Hulu -- internationally. So what's, is there an update on the Hulu international side based on those comments that you made before?\nRobert Iger : On the international side, we will have more to say after the first of the year where we're working through the formulation of the strategy in terms of what markets when, it's complicated in terms of our -- you need to make sure that we have the right product in all the markets that we launch in and to be locally relevant and locally compliance in terms of some of the rules and regulations. So I don't have much more to say there. Obviously, we have opportunities and we're going to pursue them. I mentioned Searchlight briefly in the call. Searchlight is actually developing some original content for Hulu. The Searchlight and the Fox movie studios has had an output deal with HBO that runs for a few more years. I think eventually is likely that the output would move to Hulu, but it's premature right now to speculate. What I mostly talked about in the call, as you know, Michael, is the fact that we're creating a huge FX presence on Hulu and what that means is that FX is producing original programming for will original exclusive programming and also moving FX library, some 40 series and over 1,600 episodes on Hulu, and we're making available current shows that air on FX available on Hulu within hours after the air, as we do with traditional network shows.\nMichael Nathanson : Thanks a lot.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Michael. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Your line is now  open.\nDoug Mitchelson : Thanks so much. It obviously be funded now Bob what you picked for Disney+ subs in the office pool, but for something you might be willing to comment on, I'm curious on sports, you mentioned inevitability of change, the sports need to change. It's viewed live the bundle deliver sports well monetize it. Well, obviously you're pursuing ESPN+, so I'd love any learnings on ESPN+ and how it fits in the future, sports and what you think there? And Christine, I'm just curious for Disney+ disclosures. Are you going to give us U.S. sub separate from international in the future? And then I'm just curious on Fox execution, how that Fox Solution might scale during the year or -- it sort of improve linearly during the year or is it sort of a more of a step function improvement in fiscal '21? Thanks so much.\nRobert Iger: Doug. The answer to your first question is, I'm not aware that there is an office pool and if there is an office pool. I'm not participating in and it and I don't intend to. On the sports side, as I look at it -- what ESPN+ is teaching us is that the opportunity for the company with sports is probably multi-platform. What I mean by that is, I think you continue to see ESPN available through essentially the multi-pack, multi-channel bundle on cable and satellite platforms, you'll see it available on a direct-to-consumer basis on ESPN+, which we intend to grow both in terms of the product that is on and obviously in terms of the subs. And I think you're likely to see more sports on ABC as the value of live grows on the live basically linear channels. So as we look long-term in sports, we look at basically making sports available to the consumer on the live traditional network on ESPN and on ESPN+, we think that would be a good way now only to reach more consumers, but the monetize cost -- like the acquisition of Sports Program rights in the best possible way.\nChristine McCarthy : So your question on subs and what will be disclosing on a go-forward basis. As we said at Investor Day, and all the conversations we've had with analysts and investors. Since then, we intend to be very transparent as it relates to our DTC business and the sub counts are going to be something we know people will be interested in. So we will be providing by the different platforms subs by those platforms and because we'll be launching domestically, obviously we expect Disney+ domestically to have a head start on any of the international markets. But as we go into the international markets, recognizing that it's not a big bang approach to launching all at the same time there, will be a roll out there, but we'll give you enough guidance. So you can look at the success of the rollout.\nDoug Mitchelson : I mean on the Fox Solution the pacing during the year or is it a step function improvement into fiscal '21 or is there a sort of a linear improvement in Fox Solution throughout fiscal '20?\nChristine McCarthy : So what we said about Fox dilution is we are reiterating that we will be accretive in fiscal 2021 and we haven't gone into any more specifics that.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Doug. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich : Hi, a couple of questions, on Disney+, I have one more question, can you talk about your plans and I'm sorry -- I can't speak today your plans for further third party distribution you haven't said anything about Pay-TV operators? And what are the key trade-offs with these third parties but is their billing, but you have access to the data of this -- will the subs come in through your apps. You have the data and then. And then on the parks, you called out in your press release lower attendance at Disneyland, which seems a little surprising our consumers waiting for the second attraction the second Star Wars attraction and your price increases in the past year have been on the high end of historic range. Can you talk about the outlook for pricing in the next year or two? Thanks.\nRobert Iger : I'll take the second part of your question first. Price increases at the parks, it really, we don't look at it just as increases. We look at it as an overall strategy that as Christine said in our comments is designed to basically grow yields or yield management. We're trying to basically increase the Park experienced by spreading demand out. And by making the products more affordable during periods of time that basically lower peak periods and obviously more expensive during peak periods to limit the number of people that go in. There was, we believe that there were some delayed visited there was some visitation to Galaxy's Edge both the Disney Land and it Disney World people waiting for the second, you take it attraction to open it opens in less than a month in Disney World and will open in January at Disneyland. So, we sense that there are people that are just waiting for the whole thing to be open, which is fine. The meantime those two lands have been far more successful than been reported they've had a significant lift on per caps and merchandise and food and beverage as a for instance, just to give you one crazy stat but Millennium Falcon attractions carried over 1.7 million people already since they've opened across both places. So -- and the guest experience guest satisfaction, very, very high and right availability retraction availability in the high 90s that basically means that it's very, very complex technological attraction is running really well. The first part of your question regarding Disney+, we're certainly absolutely will be made available in most traditional app selling locate stores or platforms. I don't have comment on access to consumer data if the MVPDs are distributing it or selling it. We do have access to some data obviously following both the law on some of the other platforms including Verizon as a, for instance, but I just don't have the answer to the question if it's sold on -- by MVPD. As you know, we did announced today that would deal with Amazon and they are added to a long list of other distributors including Apple and Samsung and Google and Microsoft and LG, and others.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich : Thank you.\nLowell Singer : Jessica, thanks for the questions. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Your line is now open.\nJohn Hodulik : Great, thanks, maybe first on the Verizon deal. It looks like, Bob, you're going to have access to about 20 million households or just under 20 million households that have eligibility to Disney+ for free. I think you can tell us about the wholesale arrangement you have with Verizon and T-Mobile with its distribution of Netflix for free. You get about 50% penetration, are you guys ready for the, that kind of scale in with Disney+ soon after launch. And then if I could just one more follow-up question, you talked about putting more sports on ABC. Just any thoughts that you have on potentially bidding for maybe an extra NFL deal and putting that on the broadcast network. Thanks.\nRobert Iger : Your first question, we believe that we're confident that we're really ready for scale that BAMTech platform has been tested under pretty interesting circumstance including this past Saturday night when you have hundreds of thousands of people signing up for a pay-per-view event in a very, very short concentrated period of time. We believe that the people who are signing up for Disney+ will not sign up. It is concentrated away. Now there will be many more of them. We certainly hope. But we feel that the platform is robust enough and then all the elements that need to be in place to manage that kind of scale are there. The second part of your question was \u2026\nJohn Hodulik : Just anything on the wholesale agreement?\nRobert Iger : Yes, the wholesale agreement, we're not prepared to give you any more information about that, but I can say that the deal is positive for us from an economic perspective, because it's just not being given away. In other words, we're not just giving it away. We're getting paid a certain amount for it, but I won't get into specifics regarding that. And then the last part, I think we have an interesting opportunity here to use our, both our platforms. I know in a variety of different ways including with live sports and not just take sort of a one platform approach or two platform, but to really look at the different ways this company can now reach consumers and we've done that with simultaneous coverage of say that NFL draft would probably be a great example of that. We have a very unique as a company right now in terms of these multiple platforms that in some respects is unrivaled that launch of Disney+ went a long way to us reaching more customers in a different way. When you add that to ESPN and it's channels and you add that to ABC, that's an opportunity, I think you have to also look at the opportunities we have our other programming as well. The Fox acquisition brought with it some great creative talent and some very, very successful television studios or production entities, which gives us the ability to produce more and on more of our programming. When we then take that programming and put it on ABC and our other live linear channels like Freeform FX Disney Channel, and then we move it through a system that ultimately ends up on SVOD or Hulu or Disney+, for that matter. That's an extraordinary way to reach more consumers and to monetize our investment in this product in a much more effective way and it does give us a competitive advantage of sorts, to other companies we're competing with who don't have as many platforms or as many ways to both monetize product or reach consumers.\nLowell Singer: Hey, John, thanks for the questions. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Your line is now open.\nJason Bazinet : Thanks. I just had a question for Mr. Iger, maybe the most common question we get from investors is how consumers are going to navigate a world with so many apps out in the marketplace. And so I just wanted to run a hypothesis by you and see if it resonates with how you're thinking about the world. Do you think it's a reasonable that there will be three or four, for lack of a better word broadcast apps meaning sort of broad-based and their offering, they sort of serve the masses. And then they will be, dozens of column niche apps, which are more like cable networks that sort of super serve a customer with a narrow interest, so that's my question. Do you agree with that and if that's true, is Hulu sort of your broadcast app and ESPN+ and Disney+ position does niche apps. I heard your comment about the four quadrants. But if you could just react to that know that would be helpful.\nRobert Iger : Well, the second part of your question, I don't think any of these are niche apps necessarily. And I think what we're trying to do as a company is not to look at the apps as entities unto themselves, but look at the apps as part of a broader production creativity distribution monetization play. What I mean by that is if you look at Disney or Disney+, you obviously films that are monetized and two windows. First, one of the theatrical window then what I'll call the home video window and then they move on to this SVOD platform and it's also, -- which is also a place monetizing the vast library. The same thing can be said for the television programming that we're creating, although a lot of it for Disney+ will be original or exclusive to Disney+, is nothing to be -- although there's nothing to keep us from then putting some of it on maybe a Disney Channel down the road, but we're not looking at any of these an isolated way I talk about Hulu. But I also talked about it in the context of ABC of FX and at Freeform; interestingly enough, if you look at current viewing patterns of some of our hit shows on ABC Grey's Anatomies, a good doctor would be two examples. There are ABC live they go through that Live Plus 3, Live Plus 7 or Live Plus 8 cycle, ultimately they end up on Hulu. By the end of the run of a show after one month, often these shows have tripled in terms of their consumption once they're made available on Hulu and that's only a month. It could be on Hulu for years to come. So again, I think the second part of your question, Jason, again, we're not looking at any of them an isolated form right now. As it relates to your first question, which I guess is consumer choice, consumer confusion. I think a lot about it as it relates to though website consumption patterns and even the current app patterns where no two people use the same websites of the same set of apps. The top out there is and obviously a lot of overlap with the most popular ones and then there's a lot of fragmentation. I think you're going to see that in these of good video-centric or program-centric apps where they're going to be halves and lesser halves. They're going to be a lot of them available and they'll have varying levels of consumption and the viewer, or the consumer will be able to navigate basically relatively easily because they're easily too easy to find, hopefully they will be easy to buy or use and they will be easy essentially place on mobile devices and on desktops and I actually think that if you're thinking about just these TV and movie apps or whatever you want to describe them, they're probably going to be fewer of them. Then there are apps for games and apps for everything else that you're doing internally use. So it's not a concern.\nJason Bazinet : Okay. Thank you.\nRobert Iger : I do believe though that brands will matter as we've been saying as a company for a long time and if you're in a list of choice for sports and you have ESPN on as your name or other kind of product and says Disney or the other brands, I think that immediately rises to the top of the list in terms of consumers interest and because of the recognition factor and they trust, they have in these brands.\nJason Bazinet: That makes sense. Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer : Thanks, Jason. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDan Salmon : Great. Good afternoon, everyone. Bob, I recognize, obviously a lot of focus on the DTC business of late, but the media networks business also working through a number of major renewals. We'd love to maybe just hear a little bit of an update on your near-and medium term outlook for linear subscribers, both at the traditional sorts and the vMVPDs? And then maybe just more broadly, how just conversations with the MVPDs are evolving as your DTC story emerges? And then just a quick one for Christine, maybe just an update on your conversations with the agencies -- excuse me, the ratings agencies to be clear, how they're viewing your leverage and maybe the potential to resume a buyback at some point. Thanks.\nRobert Iger : Then before I answer your question, I just wanted to clarify two things. By number -- on the number of people or the carriers -- who have been carried on the Millennium Falcon attraction was way low usually I pride myself on being right with statistics; it's 5 million not 1.7 million. And secondly, we will have access to significant amount of user data when people use our apps that have been purchased through MVPD. To your question about MVPD renewals, I can say that we have reached a deal in principle with AT&T and we're in the process of papering that which is significant in terms of our progress. We've been candid and transparent about sub trends, as Christine mentioned updating that today. There has been sort of continued erosion in abated somewhat last year it's gone a bit now. We can't predict where that goes, we just feel that as a company, the MVPD platform is still very important to us and very valuable to us and I think quite viable as well I happen to believe long term that people will be interested in lesser channel -- less channels. It doesn't mean that they don't subscribe at all to multi-channel services. But I think the trend will be in the direction of fewer channels rather than as many or certainly more and that's where the app business could benefit because I think people will buy into the app side of it and maintain some channel relationship, but I don't know what the floor is and nor do I think, the floor is anything close to being side . But we're looking at again holistically across all of our businesses in the platforms with an eye toward the broadest monetization and consumption.\nChristine McCarthy : So, Dan, on the rating agencies, we do have an active dialog with the agencies, it's the combination of me, the IR team and our treasury team and we keep them very up to date on our plans as well as our performance. We have a schedule. We're going to see them a couple of times a year. We're planning on that shortly. We'll go back and see them but we -- I think people saw that we had a significant a bond offering in August, a $7 billion bond offering. So the ratings were affirmed at that time. Across all three agencies as mid-single A and if you look at our leverage at the end of this quarter, you can calculate it, it comes in around 2.7 on a gross and about a 0.3 turn less on a net basis. And although the agencies make some adjustments to those calculations, suffice it to say that even when they calculate, using their adjustments, the agencies are still well below 3 times.\nLowell Singer : Okay. Dan. Thanks. Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nSteven Cahall : Yes, thanks very much. I was wondering, -- first off, just how you think about the right amount of content spending for Hulu maybe cash basis of both total and original and do you think you'll need to do things like lock up some of the FX show runners like some of your peers have done. And then maybe just Christine, one on the park side of thing, how do you get comfortable that you're not seeing any underlying weakening demand and it's all just deferrals and since you think that is the case, is there a point in the year where you think that you might start to see some acceleration in the attendance at the domestic parks? Thanks.\nRobert Iger : Steven, we're facing which is obviously an extraordinarily competitive marketplace for talent and television and films that's just not just creative and producing and writing and directing talent, but acting talent as well. It's a good time to be on that side of the business. We're making deals selectively based on both the talent of the people involved, but also the cost. We're trying to be mindful of the need both to fuel our platforms with enough high-quality talent, while at the same time managing the bottom line. We're not changing our guidance in terms of when we believe that these DTC businesses will achieve profitability and that's based on what we think is a reasonable amount of original content that will be made for these platforms at a cost at least today's world that we think is deliverable.\nChristine McCarthy : Steve, on domestic parks, we still feel very good about the demand for our domestic parks product. We do a lot of research in our parks business of guest satisfaction is something that we track when people come and they are intend to return. And also we have metrics that look out year-over-year what the booking trends are. And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, our booked rates at our domestic hotels are currently pacing up 5% versus prior year. So given everything that we've talked about previously, especially as it relates to Star Wars Galaxy's Edge and the complete opening of that land in both world and Disneyland, we feel really good about the momentum we have going into '19 domestic parks.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks, Steven. I mean, thanks again everyone for joining us today. Please note that a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that were referred to on this call to equivalent GAAP measures can be found on our Investor Relations website. In our remarks, we provided estimates of the performance of certain 21CF businesses in periods of the prior-year. These estimates are based on an analysis of 21CF records, but are nonetheless unaudited estimates and are not precise measures of historical results before the acquisition. Let me also remind you that certain statements on this call, including financial statements may constitute forward-looking statements under the securities laws. We make these statements on the basis of our views and assumptions regarding future events and business performance at the time we make them and we do not undertake any obligation to update these statements.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nLowell Singer: Good afternoon, and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast, and a replay and transcript will also be available on our website. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we will be happy to take your questions. So with that, I will turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nRobert Iger: Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. I've been doing earnings calls for a long time, and this is one of our more complicated ones. We certainly have a lot to cover and discuss. This is our first full quarter since we closed our acquisition of 21st Century Fox in March. Now our results reflect our efforts to integrate the assets, businesses and talent we acquired in order to enhance and advance our strategic transformation. Implementation of our integration plan is well underway, a complex process given the magnitude of the endeavor, and we remain confident in our ability to successfully execute our strategy to drive maximum value from the combined company, and our appreciation for the long-term value we can create has increased.  I'm going to ask Christine to take you through the numbers, and then I'll be back to provide some additional perspective that should give you greater insight into our bullish view of the future.\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter were $1.35. Our third quarter results reflect a full quarter of performance of the 21CF businesses we acquired and are still in the process of integrating and full consolidation of Hulu. Results this quarter include a number of factors we recognize can be challenging to model. In a moment, I'll discuss our Q3 results in greater detail and shed additional light on these factors, and then I'll highlight a few items that will impact our Q4 results. Since we are in the middle of our fiscal 2020 planning process, I expect to have more to say on the key drivers of next year's results during our Q4 call. The 21CF businesses we acquired excluding 21CF's stake in Hulu had a slightly negative impact on third quarter segment operating income. The total adverse impact on segment operating income including full consolidation of Hulu and the effect of intersegment eliminations was about $300 million. Overall, we estimate the acquisition of 21CF had a dilutive impact on our Q3 EPS before purchase accounting of about $0.60 compared to the $0.35 guidance we provided last quarter. The initial guidance of $0.35 reflected our assumptions about the business at the time. However, there were a couple of 21CF businesses whose results came in significantly lower than our expectations, in particular, the 21CF film studio and Star.  I want to take a moment to discuss the primary drivers of the underperformance of these businesses, which are reflected in our studio and Direct-to-Consumer & International segments. First, the 21CF film studio had an operating loss in the third quarter of about $170 million, which was driven by the underperformance of theatrical titles, including Dark Phoenix, marketing for future releases and development expenses, partially offset by TV/SVOD distribution. While 21CF's performance is not reflected in our prior year results, we estimate that 21CF film studio generated about $180 million of operating income in Q3 last year. On the other hand, I'll note that the performance of the Disney Film Studio continues to be incredibly strong. This quarter's theatrical slate including: Avengers: Endgame, Aladdin, Toy Story 4 and the carryover success of Captain Marvel drove higher worldwide theatrical results compared to what was also an outstanding slate of films during the third quarter last year, which included Avengers: Infinity War, Incredibles 2 and Black Panther.  Second, as you know, results at DTCI reflect ongoing investment in our direct-to-consumer businesses, and this quarter also included an operating loss at Star of about $60 million. We estimate Star generated about $150 million of operating income in the third quarter last year. Star's results this quarter came in well below our expectations and were driven primarily by a meaningful step-up in rights cost for the quadrennial Cricket World Cup and the Indian Premier League as revenue growth was more than offset by the incremental rights expense. There was an additional negative impact to EPS of about $0.06 as a result of the Hulu agreement we entered into with NBCU in May. The agreement provides us with full operational control of Hulu, and most of the $0.06 impact results from NBCU no longer being allocated its share of Hulu operating losses in our financial reporting. You'll find additional detail on the transaction and the financial impact in our 10-Q.  At Parks, Experiences and Products, growth in operating income was driven by higher results at Consumer Products and Disneyland Paris, partially offset by a decrease at our domestic Parks and Resorts. Attendance at our domestic parks was down 3% in the third quarter but per capita spending was up a healthy 10% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 3%, and occupancy was up 2 percentage points to 88%. Despite domestic parks achieving record revenue in the third quarter, operating income was down slightly due to the decline in attendance and higher costs. Disneyland Resort had strong underlying attendance fundamentals, with growth in local, domestic and international visitation. We are very pleased with how guests have responded to Galaxy\u2019s Edge and Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run as one of our most popular attractions. The decline in attendance at Disneyland Resort was primarily driven by lower annual passholder visitation as we managed demand for the first few weeks after opening Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge in order to maintain a high level of guest satisfaction. And at Walt Disney World, our survey data suggest that guests are deferring visitation until after Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge opens, which we believe contributed to the decline in attendance we saw during the third quarter.  Looking ahead, we are excited for the opening of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge at Walt Disney World and the opportunity to introduce guests to the Rise of the Resistance, our most technologically advanced and immersive attraction when that attraction opens at Walt Disney World in December and at Disneyland in January. Our domestic parks incurred incremental operating expenses during the quarter, including wage increases and pre-opening and operational expenses associated with the opening of Galaxy\u2019s Edge. Results at our international operations were higher in the third quarter due primarily to growth at Disneyland Paris.  At Consumer Products, growth in operating income was due to higher results in our merchandise licensing and retail businesses. Growth in merchandise licensing was driven by higher revenue from sales of Toy Story and Avengers merchandise, partially offset by lower sales of Star Wars merchandise. Growth in comp store sales at our brick-and-mortar stores and higher online revenue drove the increase in retail for the quarter.  Looking ahead to the fourth quarter. We anticipate strong segment operating income growth driven by the benefit from a full quarter of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge at Disneyland and growth at merchandise licensing. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 4% compared to prior year while book rates are up 3%. At Media Networks, total affiliate revenue was up 20% in the third quarter and reflects the impact of the 21CF acquisition as well as underlying growth at our legacy Media Networks. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by 16 points of growth from the acquisition of 21CF and 8 points from higher rates, partially offset by a 2.5 point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. At Broadcasting, lower programming expenses and higher affiliate revenue were more than offset by the impact of lower program sales and a decline in advertising revenue. Ad revenue was lower in the quarter as higher network rates were more than offset by lower viewership. Quarter-to-date, prime time scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 35% above upfront levels.  ABC Studios faced a difficult year-over-year program sales comparison since Q3 results last year reflected the sale of Luke Cage and this quarter, we had lower sales of How to Get Away with Murder and Designated Survivor compared to last year. Domestic cable results were up in the quarter due to the consolidation of the 21CF cable businesses and higher operating income at ESPN, partially offset by a decline at Freeform. At ESPN, growth in operating income during the third quarter was due to higher advertising and affiliate revenue, partially offset by an increase in programming and production costs driven by contractual freight increases for MLB and NBA programming and new rights. ESPN's domestic linear advertising revenue was up 13% in the third quarter. ESPN benefited from 2 extra NBA Finals games compared to last year. When you adjust for the mix and the total number of playoff games this year compared to last year, we estimate there was about an 8-point benefit to the year-over-year growth in advertising revenue. So far this quarter, ESPN's domestic cash ad sales are pacing down compared to last year.  Results at our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment reflect the consolidation of Hulu and ongoing investment at ESPN+ and Disney+. Results at our direct-to-consumer businesses had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of about $400 million. ESPN+ had a little over 2.4 million paid subscribers at the end of the third quarter, and Hulu had approximately 28 million paid subscribers.  Now I'll turn to some thoughts about the fourth quarter. We expect our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment to generate about $900 million in operating losses for the quarter, which represents an increase of about $560 million over the fourth quarter last year. We expect the continued investment in our DTC services, including ESPN+ and Disney+, and the consolidation of Hulu to drive an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of our direct-to-consumer businesses of approximately $550 million, which is almost the entirety of the total segment change versus prior year.  At Media Networks, there were a few items I'd like to mention that we believe will cause segment operating income to decline by about 10% in the fourth quarter compared to prior year. We expect that 21CF's television businesses to contribute about $200 million in operating income in the fourth quarter, with 2/3 of that contribution at Broadcasting and 1/3 at cable. We estimate 21CF's television businesses generated operating income of about $485 million in the fourth quarter last year. The expected year-over-year decline is due to a combination of factors, including lower program sales and higher content development expense, which are both related in part to our ongoing investment in our direct-to-consumer businesses. At ABC Studios, we expect a difficult program sales comparison given we sold two Marvel series, Daredevil and Iron Fist, during Q4 last year, and we don't expect comparable sales in Q4 this year. At ESPN, we expect higher programming expenses driven by contractual rate increases and launch costs for the ACC Network and lower ad revenue to more than offset growth in affiliate revenue.  In aggregate, we estimate the acquisition of 21st Century Fox and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu will have a dilutive impact on our Q4 earnings per share before purchase accounting of about $0.45 per share. Despite these headwinds, we remain excited about the acquisition of 21CF and still expect the acquisition to be accretive to EPS before purchase accounting for fiscal 2021. And we also remain on track to realize over $2 billion in cost synergies by fiscal 2021.  And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Bob.\nRobert Iger: Before I discuss our new strategy, I'd like to begin by singling out our studio, which is the envy of the industry. The studio has generated $8 billion in global Box Office in 2019, a new industry record. And we still have five months left in the calendar year with movies like Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker still to come. So far this year, we've released 5 of the top 6 movies including four that have generated more than $1 billion in global Box Office. Avengers: Endgame is now the highest grossing film in history with almost $2.8 billion worldwide. Captain Marvel, Aladdin and The Lion King have each surpassed $1 billion. And with more than $960 million in Box Office to date, Toy Story 4 will likely cross that threshold in the coming weeks. And all of these movies will be on Disney+ in the first year of launch.  The studio co-chairs behind this record-setting performance, Alan Horn and Alan Bergman, are now redefining 20th Century Fox's film strategy for the future, applying the same discipline and creative standards behind the success of Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm. They're taking the Fox Studios in new direction, all new development slates will focus on a select group of high-quality movies for theatrical release as well as for our Hulu and Disney+ platforms. And Fox Searchlight will continue to make the prestige films it's known for while expanding its high-quality original storytelling into the DTC space. We see great long-term value in the broad collection of theatrical IP we acquired from Fox, including iconic movie franchises such as Avatar and Planet of the Apes as well as Marvel's X-Men, the Fantastic Four and Deadpool, which are now part of Marvel Studios under the leadership of Kevin Feige, the architect of the Marvel cinematic universe, which now includes 23 movies with a global Box Office of more than $22 billion to date.  We're also focused on leveraging Fox's vast library of great titles to further enrich the content mix on our DTC platforms. For example, reimagining Home Alone, Night at the Museum, Cheaper by the Dozen and Diary of a Wimpy Kid for a new generation on Disney+. As I said a few times, we analyzed the 21st Century Fox opportunity entirely through the lens of our future business, evaluating the long-term potential especially related to accelerating our transformation into the DTC space on a global basis. As a result of the acquisition, we also now have full operational control of Hulu and a clear path to full ownership, providing another powerful platform for us to produce and distribute great content. Hulu will provide us with an excellent opportunity to leverage the capabilities of our television studios and brands, notably FX and ABC Television.  The deal also added Star and Hotstar to our portfolio of businesses, giving us a significant presence in India, which will soon become the most populous country in the world. It's a huge market with interesting dynamics notably, a rapidly rising middle class with a strong and growing appetite for media, especially sports. To give you an idea of the value of this platform, last quarter, Hotstar had more than 300 million average monthly users, served an unprecedented 100 million daily users and delivered a high-quality streaming experience to 25.3 million simultaneous users, which is a new world record. The platform's broad array of premium sports rights will serve it well over the next five years especially as we expand the service into markets across Southeast Asia.  At Walt Disney Television, the Fox acquisition brought us talented and experienced senior leadership who are now in place to produce much of the content we will rely on to implement our ambitious strategy. The studio capabilities, production expertise and valuable relationships with the creative community will be vital to our DTC plans while also overseeing ABC, ABC News, our own television stations, FX, Freeform, the Disney Channel and Nat Geo. National Geographic brings a strong global brand to our portfolio, along with world-class content for our television and DTC businesses. Disney+ will offer more than 600 hours of premium content from National Geographic at launch, along with almost 300 hours of family entertainment from the Fox Studios library. Disney+ will ultimately become the exclusive streaming service for our vast library of movies and series, National Geographic content, all upcoming Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars movies and a robust slate of high-quality original programming from the creative engines that drive our entire company.  Regarding our suite of DTC services, I'm pleased to announce that in the United States, consumers will be able to subscribe to a bundle of Disney+, ESPN+ and ad-supported Hulu for $12.99 a month. The bundle will be available on our November 12 launch date. Before we take your questions, let me reiterate a few things. Today, much of our focus is on integrating Fox's assets and leveraging them, along with our Disney businesses, to move quickly into the direct-to-consumer space. Nothing is more important to us than getting this right. We remain confident in our strategy and our ability to successfully execute it, and as Christine noted, we still expect the acquisition to be accretive to EPS before purchase accounting for fiscal 2021. We're clearly bullish on our future for good reasons.  And on that note, Christine and I will be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.\nAlexia Quadrani: Just two questions, if I may. First on the Fox integration. I know it's really early days, and you highlighted some areas of weakness 21CF had in the quarter but you also spoke about the opportunity of Fox and its IP presents longer term. I guess my question is any color how long it takes before the Disney imprint really impacts these assets? I assume it takes a while for the studio and the other assets to really -- you have to own them for a while before you really see the impact. And then my follow-up question is on the parks. Any color on how Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge opening in Disneyland did versus your internal expectations and anything you learned from it in terms of the opening that you can sort of apply to Orlando's opening later this month?\nRobert Iger: Sure, Alexia. Thank you. First of all, regarding Fox and the integration, I think what -- in terms of these results, aside from a lot of the ins and outs that Christine described like the cost of Cricket in India, et cetera, and so on and the impact of the Hulu deal, I think one of the biggest issues that we faced in this quarter in terms of the result -- of the earnings was the Fox Studio performance, which was well below where it had been and well below where we hoped it would be when we made the acquisition. Now understand, I've been through a number of these. First of all, I was bought twice. First at Capital Cities/ABC and then Disney bought ABC. And I know what happens when companies are purchased. Often, decision-making can grind to a halt or certainly slow down. We've managed to avoid that in the purchases of Pixar and Marvel and even Lucasfilm in part because between when we made the deal and when the deal closed was relatively short periods of time.  In this case, we announced the deal first in December of '17, and we didn't close the deal until spring of 2019. And that's a long period of time for a business that relies on constant decision-making and constant attention to detail. And while I don't in any way mean to cast aspersions at any individuals at all, it was a very difficult transition for that business. And what we've done is we've put it under our studio, and you know the results there. They've been hard at work working primarily with Emma Watts on the live action side to redirect the efforts of the live action part of that business. First of all, to consolidate the cutback in the number of releases and then to focus on the kind of release that we would hope to come out of that studio. We like some of the movies that are coming up, notably there's one called Ford v Ferrari which we've all seen, which is great, but it will probably take a good solid year, maybe 2 years before we can have an impact, obviously takes longer on the development side but an impact on the films that are actually in production. But we're all confident that we're going to be able to turn around the fortunes of Fox live action, and you'll see those results in a couple of years.  On Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge front, to give you some color, I think a number of things happened. First of all, helped in part by some of our efforts, there was tremendous concern in the marketplace that there was going to be huge crowding when we open Galaxy\u2019s Edge. And so some people stayed away just because they expected that it would not be a great guest experience. The same time that was going on, all the local hotels in the region expecting a huge influx of visitation raised their prices. So it simply got more expensive to come stay in Anaheim. In addition to that, we raised our prices. We brought our daily price up, so if you think about local visitation, we brought the price of a one day ticket up substantially from a year ago. And then we opened up Galaxy\u2019s Edge with one attraction instead of two, the second attraction is going to open in January. And so all of those factors contributed to attendance that was below what we would have hoped it would be. That said, guest satisfaction, interest in the attractions, in the land is extremely high. They're among the most popular thing at the Park. And so long term, look, we build these things for the long term, we have no concerns whatsoever about them. We're opening Galaxy\u2019s Edge in August in Orlando. The second attraction there will open in December. And as I said, the second attraction in Anaheim will open in January. So we feel great about the product that we've created. It's just going to take some time for -- basically for things to work themselves out in terms of how the marketplace is reacting.\nChristine McCarthy: Alexia, I just want to put a little more granularity on the Disneyland results for the quarter. As I said, the attendance was down 3%, but the paid attendance was up in the quarter, and that lower attendance was primarily driven by the annual passholder visitation. And when we look at the per cap spend across Disneyland all categories, they were up significantly year-over-year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.\nMichael Nathanson: One for Bob and one for Christine. Bob, thanks for the update on the Hulu bundle. That's what we would have asked you. Another question on Hulu is any update on international rollout now that you have full control? That's one that people have been focused on. And then for Christine, I'm just confused a bit by what surprised you at Star. Because those Cricket contracts were known, so was it something more about the performance of those contracts that -- in terms of the ratings of that contract that surprised you? Anything more on India would be helpful. What disappointed you?\nRobert Iger: We're not updating anything regarding Hulu internationally. Kevin Mayer and the team at Hulu are studying opportunities, along with our international team, market-by-market. Obviously, we have designs on growing Hulu outside of the United States but no update on that right now.\nChristine McCarthy: And on Star, Michael, it was the quadrennial Cricket World Cup, of course. They have their Indian Premier League, which is ongoing, but this is once every four years for the World Cup. There were a couple of significant games that were rained out. They have insurance coverage for some of those, but any proceeds would be in future periods. And there was also some weakness in advertising revenue that was related to the local advertising market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Just a couple of different questions. But could you talk a little bit about the marketing for Disney+? With the launch less than three months to get -- away, you've talked at the Analyst Day about having 90%-plus awareness. Can you just -- I haven't seen marketing yet, so can you talk about the plan? Different topic but on all of the stuff that's going on in China as well as in Hong Kong, can you talk a little bit about -- or give us some color on what you're seeing in terms of impact on -- towards some of the parks and how it might be affecting pricing and future investment? And then one last kind of follow-up on the pricing. You did increase prices unusually, I think just -- I'm not sure if it's just Disneyland. Can you talk about how you're thinking about pricing going forward at the domestic parks?\nRobert Iger: Disney+ marketing is going to start to hit in later this month, later in August. We're actually going to allow members of D23 to be the first to subscribe. I'm actually going through a comprehensive marketing plan with the team next week. Comprehensive probably is an understatement. It is going to be treated as the most important product that the company has launched in, I don't know, certainly during my tenure in the job, which is quite a long time. And you will see marketing both in traditional and nontraditional directions basically digital and analog also significant amount of support within the company on basically company platforms. And then of course all of the touch points that the company has, whether it's people staying in our hotels, people that have our co-branded credit card, people who are members of D23, annual passholders, I could go on and on. But the opportunities are tremendous to market this. And I feel good about some of the creative that I've already seen. But you won't start to see it until later this month.  On the China front, to date, we have not seen any impact at all in Shanghai about the unrest that's going on in Hong Kong or from the trade issues between our countries. In Hong Kong, we have seen an impact from the protests. Obviously, they are significant in nature. And while the impact is not reflected in the results that we just announced, you can expect that we will feel it in the quarter that we're currently in, and we'll see how long the protests go on. But there's definitely been disruption that has impacted our visitation there. On the pricing side, as we've said a number of times, our pricing is designed to really accomplish a number of things. One is to reflect the value of the product that we have in the marketplace that includes the franchises and the popularity of them. And of course, the investments that we've made in these parks and resorts by continuing to build them out and continuing to create experiences that are better than many of those that we've had in the past. We also have tried very hard to protect guest experience, and so the pricing has been designed to make it more expensive in peak periods to manage that demand and less expensive or not as expensive in the nonpeak periods to make it more accessible. And for the most part, we've done a good job doing that. We know that demand on our product is so extraordinary in the peak periods that it just is in our better interest to manage crowding because it just affects guest satisfaction.  At the same time that we have taken our prices up, our competition has actually been in the market discounting a little bit more. We've certainly seen that with Universal in Florida. And so the gap between what we did and where they've been maybe just a little greater than it's been, and perhaps that's had an impact. We obviously monitor these things very carefully. I try to explain what some of the pricing impact on Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge was, but we do not feel that we have a pricing issue at our domestic parks. And that's reflected in basically not only current business but a fair amount of research that we've done.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Bob, as you get ready to launch Disney+, I'm wondering if you could update us on sort of the technical platform behind the product and kind of where that stands versus where it needs to be, scale a big business globally. And also your philosophy on distribution partnerships. You mentioned bundling Hulu and ESPN+ which certainly makes sense. But there's a lot of companies, as you're well aware of, out there sort of selling in a digital native environment like Amazon and Apple and others, lots of services like these. I'm just wondering if you could talk about your philosophy on utilizing those versus a pure direct-to-consumer business because those could certainly impact sort of how fast you get out of the gate.  And then I just wanted to ask, Christine, you didn't mention the 21CF Television Studio, which I believe is in your broadcast segment. That's a business that I think you would acknowledge has been performing quite well for a long time. Any sense for how that's doing or how that impacted the quarter would be appreciated.\nRobert Iger: Okay. On the second part of your question first, about basically digital distribution partners. At Investor Day, we announced that we had a few distribution partners. There are others out there, notably Apple and Amazon and Google, for instance, that we've been in discussions with about distribution. You can expect that we will conclude deals with them as distribution partners. We think it's important for us to achieve scale relatively quickly, and they'll be an important part of that. Nothing to announce specifically, except we've had conversations with all of them. They're all interested in distributing the product.  On the tech side, we continue to look very carefully at the tech platform that we have. Obviously, we're using that platform for ESPN+. We continue to learn. We think we're most focused on not how robust it is because we believe we have that already, but we're most focused on the onboarding experience and making sure that people who sign up as subscribers for the service do so with incredible ease. We know how important it is to create a frictionless experience, and there's a lot of time being spent on that. I want to also say even though it wasn't part of your question that as we're dealing with distribution opportunities as well as what we just talked about, which is the tech and the sign-on or the onboarding side, there's a huge amount of work going on the production front. And I just want to touch on some of that.  As you know, we're going to launch with a significant number of movie titles that -- from our studio that will be well over 300 on launch day and over 400 in year one, including the great slate that the studio has out in the marketplace now. By the way, those titles are significant in terms of their quality. For instance, there'll be eight Star Wars titles when we launch, 18 Pixars, 70 Disney Animation, 240 Disney live action, four Marvel and then followed by eight more Marvel in year one. So a lot of quality. And then over 7,500 episodes of Disney TV. We're augmenting all of that with a tremendous amount of original live action product and have actually screened a fair amount including the entire series of Mandalorians for Season 1, a number of the movies that we made including Togo and Lady and the Tramp and Noelle and Stargirl, and I can probably name a few others, and a lot of the other series product that we're making from Marvel, from Pixar, from Disney Channel, High School Musical another one. And I've been really impressed with the quality, with the variety and with the volume. So a tremendous amount going on, on that front. I'm convinced that we're going to launch with a tremendous array of intellectual property for people who are interested in National Geographic, Marvel, Pixar, Disney and Star Wars. And then on the studio front, Christine could take some of the particulars as it relates to the television side.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. So 21st Century TV was a contributor in the quarter on an operating income basis. It had a more significant contribution on the cable side than the broadcast side. Although we did mention that there would be some headwinds in the fourth quarter, it will still be a positive contributor. It'll just be lower than it was year-over-year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein.\nTodd Juenger: Picking up a little bit, I guess, on where Michael was. I really appreciate all the different lines of businesses and brands and how you're helping us to understand them. Can I ask a little bit about where Hulu Live fits into all of this in the states? Generally and just we've seen price increases at other places, how do you feel about profitability there? Just you're -- the fact that you're in the business now of being a MVPD and what that role that plays for Disney. That's question one. And question number two, not completely unrelated, I'm a little confused at how you're thinking about the live television brands like National Geographic and the Disney kids channels which will also exist on Disney+. Will all the content that -- especially the new content that's on the TV networks be available to Disney+ subscribers? Is there a windowing philosophy same way going backwards? How do you manage that so that consumers of both products feel like they're getting the full benefit of those brands?\nRobert Iger: Good question. No. We're negotiating with a number of MVPDs right now to extend our linear or live, as you called them, television channels. And these remain important deals to us and important businesses to us as well. And obviously, that includes ABC and Disney Channel, and you mentioned Nat Geo and Freeform and FX to name a few. So it is important for us to continue to fuel those channels with enough quality, enough original programming to support the business as they exist today. We also know that if you look at all the disruption in our business, the business that's probably being impacted the most is that live multichannel television product. And so the pivot to the direct-to-consumer business is designed to not only address the opportunity that exists in that space, but to address the challenge that exists on the traditional side of the business, which means that we have our own balancing act to do in terms of fueling both sides, the traditional side and the new side or the direct-to-consumer business with enough quality product to succeed in both places. Obviously, what we also are doing is setting ourselves up in a way that we can be resilient, probably more resilient than any of our competitors should the traditional side erode so significantly that it's not as viable as it has been as a business. And that would enable us to pivot pretty quickly by moving even more product from the traditional channels over to the nontraditional channels. So it's -- as I said, it's a balancing act. We believe that we're making enough quality product for both sides right now to feel confident about both sides of the business. The windowing strategy essentially is that we are taking a lot of product that we're making for the traditional channels and ultimately moving it onto the nontraditional. But we're also making, as you know, original product for the new channel, the Disney+ and Hulu, that will not go back onto the other channels. But although in some cases, it might. Just to give you an idea, we'd be making FX shows for Hulu that might premiere on Hulu but ultimately end up on the linear channels is one example of that. So we're going to look at variety of different opportunities and just make sure that there's enough content flowing in both directions for the businesses to be successful.  On the Hulu Live front, we felt it was important to do what we can to grow digital MVPD businesses. We obviously know that there are others in the space that have been good partners to us. YouTube would be one to mention. We like the fact that Hulu is out there with a product that is very unique, in that it gives subscribers an opportunity to buy linear television, digital over-the-top linear television, to buy off network programming because we know the deals, the content licensing deals that they have with the networks, and to buy original programming. And that combination of all three puts Hulu in a very unique place, in that there's really no one out there that's offering the comprehensive television offering the way Hulu is. And we'll continue to stay at it.  The other thing to note by the way is Hulu has grown -- is it's also developed into a very, very important advertising business. And when you think about advertisers who are looking to reach clients on digital platforms, Hulu offers a great opportunity to do that. To what extent those live channels will enable the opportunity on -- to sell advertising along with the advertising that is sold and the programming that's made just for Hulu is another story. But it's a big part and a growing part of that business.\nChristine McCarthy: And one more thing on Hulu Live, the digital platform grew the most of any DMVPD this quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Marci Ryvicker with Wolfe Research.\nMarci Ryvicker: Just I have one for Christine. There are so many moving pieces at the moment. Can you just talk about your leverage target? Has this changed at all in terms of the actual target or when you expect to get there? And then maybe comment on your free cash flow priorities and how should we think about the timing on the return to share repurchases.\nChristine McCarthy: Sure. Our target has not changed, Marci. We're still targeting a mid-single A target. We have an ongoing dialogue with the rating agencies. They understand our strategy. They understand what it takes to get there. And the overall pivot in our strategy has been multiyear, and I would say it's been capped off with the acquisition of 21st Century assets. And we will be meeting with them, but our attitude towards share repurchase has always been once we invest in our businesses and we make any acquisitions as we see fit, we look at our dividend capacity. And if all of those still result in excess cash for us, we will return it to shareholders. I don't think you should anticipate that happening in the near future because we're still in an investment mode as it relates to our direct-to-consumer activities, and that's what we're really focused on right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nDouglas Mitchelson: Bob, I guess two questions. First, I think there's a lot of familiarity sort of with everyone listening on the call as to the U.S. prospects of the Disney+ service and what marketing you might do in the competitive environment. Is international different? I mean you talked about bundling with Hulu in the U.S., but that's not something you can do overseas. So I just love to hear how you're approaching international marketing and sort of the early prospects for the service overseas to the extent it's different in the United States. And then I have a second question on content distribution strategy.\nRobert Iger: Well, we will launch in international markets very quickly. I think two actually are going to launch when we launch Disney+ around the same time. And then over the next two to three years, we're going to roll out a number of other markets. So you're right, a number of those markets are different than the United States. But what they do share, which is very, very important, is an interest in Marvel, Pixar, Disney, National Geographic and Star Wars. So the product that's being made for the platforms travels globally, and that's a big deal. We will have to augment it in certain markets with local programming to meet quotas that are now being applied to OTT services. And we're also going to enter into discussions on an international basis market-by-market with local distributors as well. We're already in those discussions actually.  And so we don't have anything to announce right now in terms of new markets that we're going to launch in. But it's safe to assume that we're going to launch in multiple international markets within two years, certainly within three years, of launch in the United States, in a couple of other markets.\nDouglas Mitchelson: And I guess on content distribution, you talked about fueling the traditional channels versus fueling your OTT services and obviously a third area is selling programming to third-party SVOD services. And I'm sort of curious overseas, I know Hulu international is off-limit. To the extent you're trying to drive Fox profitability to the point where it's accretive to fiscal '21, do you need to continue to sell programming into SVOD windows overseas? And the reason I obviously ask is I'm wondering if at some point you'll start warehousing content that would go into a Hulu international service.\nRobert Iger: I think on the Fox front, meaning or we'll call it non-Disney Pixar-branded type product or Star Wars, we'll continue to license to third parties overseas to reap the benefits of the revenue that we could derive from those sales. Until such time as we believe a launch in that market is imminent, in which case, we'll pivot in a whole product for us. We're even going to do that to a lesser extent, a far lesser extent, with some of the Disney content as well until we're ready to launch in a market. We may license some of that content to third parties, too, to continue to drive revenue.\nDouglas Mitchelson: Should we assume shorter-term deals than you might have done historically?\nRobert Iger: Yes. Yes. Clearly, when we do such deals, we're going to do so to avoid the encumbrances that would make it impossible or difficult for us to put the product on our platform once we launch.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays.\nKannan Venkateshwar: So Bob, one question for you on the content front, which is when you think about the balance between quality and quantity, how much content from a volume perspective is enough? How much is too much? I mean how are you thinking about the long-term targets in terms of content volumes? And how do you balance that? And Christine, from your perspective on the marketing side, I think you mentioned Q3 is where we might see some of those spend coming in, Q3 and Q4. Will this all be expensed upfront? Or will this be amortized over time? Would be great if you could help us with that.\nRobert Iger: As we said, Kannan, on Investor Day and we said a few times, given the fact that the Disney+ product is Disney and Pixar and Marvel and Star Wars, Nat Geographic, I mentioned it 8,000 times, we feel that we can focus more on quality than on quantity. But we obviously know we need enough quantity under each brand umbrella to drive subscribers who are primarily interested in those brands. And so obviously if you compare us to Netflix, we're going to have far less products than they do, but we're lying on the strength of our brands and the fervor that fans of those brands have for the product that we make under those brand umbrellas.\nChristine McCarthy: And on the marketing side, Kannan, in my comments, I mentioned marketing, but that was related to 21CF's film studio that they had some marketing in the third quarter for movies that would be released in fourth quarter. But I'm assuming your question really is related to marketing that would go along with the launch of Disney+. And as far as that's concerned, we will be expensing those marketing costs as we incur them.\nOperator: Our last question is from Jason Bazinet with Citi.\nJason Bazinet: Just a question for Mr. Iger. In the fullness of time as your DTC strategy plays out, do you think Hulu will be a more important app or financial driver than Disney+? And the reason I ask is I understand the elements that Fox brought to the Disney+ app, The Simpsons, Nat Geo and some of those Marvel characters. But those seem sort of small in the context of the amount of money that you spent to acquire Fox. And so it sort of hints that something bigger is afoot in terms of your overall strategy.\nRobert Iger: Well, we obviously, in analyzing the assets from 21st Century Fox that we bought, placed a lot of value on the Hulu stake that we were getting. And that obviously was also reflected in the deal that we did with Comcast, where the value of their stake has been public since we announced that deal. So Hulu will play an important part in our future as a platform for the non-so-called family-like programming that will be on Disney+. And that will be fueled not just by library that we bought from Fox, and that library is both movie and television library, but by a tremendous amount of television production capabilities. So when you think about what the -- our company today and the creative engines, we obviously have a movie studio that includes now Fox live action and Fox Searchlight, we have -- and along with all the Disney assets. We have a sprawling television business that includes ABC, Disney Channel, FX, Nat Geo, Freeform, et cetera, and so on, and the television business or unit that we created under Peter Rice has now been structured to produce original product for all of the platforms, both the linear platforms, the traditional MVPD channels, as well as the new platforms, notably Hulu. So there will be an increase in production activity of the company under that unit producing products specifically for Hulu.  And so as we see it, our play in the digital OTT space ultimately globally, but we're going to start as we've said more domestically, is to have general entertainment, we'll call it Hulu, more family-like entertainment, which is Disney+, and sports. And that bundle that we're creating, that $12.99 bundle, where you can buy all three offers consumers tremendous volume, tremendous quality and tremendous variety for a good price.\nLowell Singer: And thank you, Jason, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Lowell Singer, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\nLowell Singer: Good afternoon, and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago, and it's available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast, and a transcript will also be available on our website.  Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob will lead off, followed by Christine, and we will then be happy to take your questions. So with that, I will turn the call over to Bob, and we'll get started.\nRobert Iger: Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased with our results in Q2, which were impacted by our acquisition of 21st Century Fox in late March as well as our ongoing investment in our direct-to-consumer business. But I'd like to start by mentioning the phenomenal success of Avengers: Endgame, which continues to exceed even our highest expectations. After delivering the biggest opening of all time, the movie has generated almost $2.3 billion in worldwide box office to date, making it the second-highest grossing film of all time, after just 2 weeks in theaters. We've also been extremely pleased with the reaction to our Investor Day presentation, which offered an in-depth look at our DTC plans, including additional information regarding ESPN+ and Hulu as well as a detailed look at the content interface and pricing for Disney+. And I'm happy to announce that Avengers: Endgame will be available on Disney+ on December 11, just a month after we launched the service.  While the initial response to our DTC efforts has been gratifying, we're not taking anything for granted, and we continue to leverage our creative engines across our company to ensure we deliver a strong value proposition to consumers. We're expanding into the DTC arena with tremendous excitement and optimism, confident that the indelible connection we've built with billions of people over a century of great storytelling gives us an advantage in the marketplace and provides a strong foundation for success.  This is the first earnings call since our 21st Century Fox acquisition closed, and I'd like to give you a quick summary of our integration and consolidation efforts across the company. From the beginning, we analyzed this acquisition through the lens of our new strategy. When we first considered the deal, we had just announced our DTC initiative, and we saw tremendous value in the Fox assets in terms of expanding our ambitions and enhancing our potential for success. And as you saw on Investor Day, we're already moving forward in that regard. In addition to Fox's tremendous wealth of content, we now have a deep bench of experienced industry leaders across the entire company, a veritable, all-star team of proven management talent who embraced the Walt Disney company strategy and are working in concert to execute it.  In our media business, the senior leadership from Fox are now in place, including Peter Rice who's running the Walt Disney Television group; and Dana Walden, who's running our television studios as well as managing the ABC Network and owned stations. John Landgraf with FX is looking for opportunities to increase the production capacity at FX to support our DTC businesses. Uday Shankar is running all of our non-parks businesses in India and Asia-Pacific. And Jan Koeppen is head of our media and DTC businesses in EMEA. Last week, we elevated to Alan Bergman to co-chair of our studio and entertainment group, and he and Alan Horn are focused on integrating and managing the combined studio businesses. Emma Watts from 20th Century Fox is now part of their senior leadership team focused on making movies for theatrical release as well as for our DTC platforms, including [temple] titles such as Ford V. Ferrari, James Cameron's next Avatar films and Steven Spielberg's West Side Story. And Fox Searchlight, run by Nancy Utley and Steve Gilula, is another creative engine that has defined itself with unique high-quality films.  The further we get into the integration process, the more impressed we are with the value of the assets, the quality of the talent, and the opportunities we're able to create. National Geographic is a prime example. We're already working with National Geographic to explore the brand's potential across the company from creating content for our DTC business, to echo travel adventures and merchandise for our Parks, Experiences and Product business, and there's a strong alignment with our ongoing environmental and conservation efforts.  Looking forward, we've got a very busy year ahead, including a number of major developments in our parks and resorts. We're breaking ground on a significant expansion at Tokyo DisneySea in the 21st, which will add new themed areas and attractions to that park. And we're looking forward to the grand opening of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge in our Disneyland Resort on May 31. The excitement around this new land is unbelievable and will only grow once people have a chance to experience it for themselves. As we've said, it's the largest land we've ever built, but the sheer audacity of the creativity and technology is even more impressive than the size. Disney World is getting its own Galaxy's Edge on August 29.  Turning to our studio, our incredible film slate for 2019 is now even more ambitious as a result of our 21st Century Fox acquisition. The movies we'll release between now and Christmas include: Aladdin, The Lion King, and Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, from Disney; Pixar's Toy Story 4; Frozen 2 from Disney Animation; and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker as well as Dark Phoenix, Stuber, The Art of Racing in the Rain, Ready or Not, Ad Astra, Woman in the Window, Ford V. Ferrari, and Spies in Disguise from the Fox Studios. Needless to say, this is clearly an exciting time for our entire company.  I'm now going to turn the call over to Christine to talk about our quarter, and then we'll take your questions. Christine?\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.61. As you know, we closed the acquisition of 21st Century Fox on March 20, so our Q2 results reflect the consolidation of the Fox assets, including the impact of consolidating Hulu for the last 11 days of the quarter. Results for 21st Century Fox for the 11 days, which we are reporting as a separate segment, reflect the contribution of $373 million in revenue and $25 million in operating income. We recorded $105 million in purchase price amortization in Q2, which is not included in these results.  At Studio Entertainment, lower worldwide theatrical and home entertainment results were partially offset by higher TV SVOD distribution results. As we discussed last quarter, we expected the studio's results this quarter to face a tough comparison given that Q2 last year was the best second quarter in the studio's history. We were pleased with our worldwide theatrical results in the quarter, especially the strong performance of Captain Marvel. However, the year-over-year comparison reflects the outstanding performance of Black Panther and the carryover performance of Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Coco last year.  Our home entertainment business also faced a different comparison given Q2 titles last year, which included Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Thor: Ragnarok and Coco. In total, our worldwide theatrical and home entertainment results came in modestly better than our previous outlook due primarily to the stronger-than-anticipated performance from Captain Marvel.  At Parks, Experiences and Products, operating income growth was driven by higher results at our theme parks and resorts and the Cruise Line businesses, and growth of consumer products. Second quarter parks and resorts results reflect an adverse OI impact of about $45 million due to the timing of the Easter holiday period as both weeks of the holiday period fell entirely in Q3 this year, whereas last year, 1 week of the holiday period fell in Q2. Despite this headwind, we continued to deliver solid growth at our domestic parks and resorts business.  In the second quarter, higher operating income was driven by increased guest spending and attendance at the park and higher occupied room nights at the hotels, partially offset by higher costs. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 1% in the second quarter and per capita spending was up 4% on higher admissions and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 1%, and occupancy was up 3 percentage points to 93%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 3% compared to prior year while booked rates are up 2%.  Growth at Disney Cruise Line reflects the impact of a 14-day Dry Dock of the Disney Magic during Q2 last year and higher average ticket prices in Q2 this year. Results at our international operations were higher in the second quarter due primarily to growth at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. At consumer products, growth in operating income was due to higher results at our games businesses, which benefited from the sale of rights to a videogame and the release of a licensed title, Kingdom Hearts III. These results were partially offset by a decrease in our merchandise licensing business driven by lower minimum guarantee revenue due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, partially offset by a favorable foreign exchange impact. Total segment operating income margin was up about 220 basis points compared to Q2 last year. We estimate the timing of the Easter holiday period had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating margin of about 60 basis points.  Margins at our domestic parks and experiences businesses were up about 140 basis points and were adversely impacted by about 80 basis points due to the timing of the Easter holiday period. At Media Networks, operating income was modestly lower in the second quarter as the decline in broadcasting more than offset growth at cable. Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 4% in the quarter due to growth at both cable and broadcasting. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by 7 points of growth due to higher rates, partially offset by a little less than a 2-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers and a 1-point decline due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. At Broadcasting, operating income was lower in the quarter as growth in affiliate revenue was more than offset by higher programming costs, lower programming sales, and a 3% decline in advertising revenue. Quarter-to-date, prime time scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running about 40% above upfront levels.  Program sales were lower in the quarter, though came in better than expected since we were able to recognize the sale of season 3 of Jessica Jones in the quarter. Domestic cable results were up in the quarter as higher operating income at ESPN, and to a lesser extent, the Disney Channel, were partially offset by a decline at Freeform. At ESPN, operating income was higher in the second quarter as higher affiliate revenue more than offset higher programming and production costs and lower advertising revenue. ESPN's programming and production costs were higher in the quarter as lower programming cost due to the timing shift of the college football semifinal games were more than offset by contractual rate and production cost increases for ski sports programming.  ESPN aired three of the New Year's Six bowl games during the second quarter, similar to last year. However, this year, the two semifinal games aired during the first quarter. ESPN's domestic linear advertising revenue was down about 2% in the second quarter, though we estimate it was up mid- to high single digits when adjusted for the adverse impact of the shift in the timing of the college football semifinal games. So far this quarter, ESPN's domestic cash ad sales are pacing up compared to last year, driven in part by scatter CPMs that are up nicely above upfront levels.  Turning to direct-to-consumer and international. Growth at our international channels, which was due to higher affiliate rates and lower sports programming costs, was more than offset by lower results from our direct-to-consumer businesses, which reflect ongoing investment at ESPN+ and Disney+ and losses from the consolidation of Hulu. Last quarter, I told you we expected the continued ramp-up of ESPN+ and ongoing development of our Disney+ service to have an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income for the second quarter of about $200 million, with about 2/3 of that attributable to ESPN+. The actual number came in a little better than the guidance we provided last quarter, driven by timing of expenses.  As we look to the third quarter, we expect operating income from our direct-to-consumer businesses to reflect full consolidation of Hulu's results, the continued ramp-up of ESPN+ and ongoing investment in Disney+. As such, we expect our direct-to-consumer businesses to have an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of about $460 million.  Overall, we estimate the acquisition of 21st Century Fox to have a dilutive impact on our Q3 earnings per share before purchase accounting of about $0.35. Additionally, we expect about $900 million in purchase accounting charges related to the amortization of intangible assets and the step-up on film and TV assets, which we estimate will impact third quarter GAAP reported earnings per share by about $0.37.  We expect these purchase accounting charges to total approximately $1.8 billion for fiscal 2019. And as you can see in our reporting of this quarter's results, we are reporting the impact of purchase accounting outside of individual segment results. I'll now turn the call over to Lowell, and we'd be more than happy to take your questions.\nLowell Singer: Okay, Christine, thank you. Operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Bob, I want to ask you about -- actually, Bob and Christine, about Fox. Now that it's closed and the streaming Investor Day is behind us. Bob, can you put this acquisition into context? When you look at the deals you've done in the past, you've talked a lot about acquiring powerful brands like Pixar, Lucas and Marvel, and obviously, we've seen the success there. This feels like a little bit of a different transaction, but I'd love to hear it from you now that you own the business, what you think the biggest opportunity is running this company and integrating it into Disney or opportunities as you look forward, so we can think about where opportunities and upside might exist. And sort of a similar question, Christine, to you, on both synergies and the balance sheet, which are 2 areas you've talked about. Now that you own the business, can you update us on your thoughts on synergy timing and any opportunities you see on the debt side, too?\nRobert Iger: Thanks, Ben. To give you some perspective, in the summer of 2017, I think it was during our August earnings call, we announced our intention to purchase the controlling interest in BAMTech and to launch Disney and ESPN direct-to-consumer service. Soon after that, Rupert and I first started engaging in conversation about the possibility of buying 21st Century Fox assets, so that when we began analyzing their value, it was all through the lens of the launch of direct-to-consumer platforms. And we were able to, in analyzing value, really think hard about how we might use or leverage both the content we are buying -- I'm talking about library, the brands we are buying and the titles, but also the people at Fox, which is critical, to essentially enable us to fulfill our goals as it related to direct-to-consumer.  And I think if you then sort of dissolve almost all the way forward to our Investor Day and think about the fact that Uday Shankar was on stage talking about direct-to-consumer business service in India, which is beyond what we're even imagining back in '17, but the fact that National Geographic was well-represented, the fact that we announced The Simpsons deal, just a few examples, you can -- I think immediately conclude that the vision that we had, which is to analyze value through that lens, was basically being implemented or showing potential right away. I can't emphasize enough the importance of people, too. Because as I think we all know, these are ambitious plans, both in terms of managing the technology side and the interface with consumers, but in particular, ambitious plans when it comes to the creation of original content. And whether you're looking at the movie side or in the TV side, although in the direct-to-consumer front, the television side probably takes the front seat, we need great people to create all the programming and to supervise all of the talent that will be needed to serve consumers well on these platforms. And what we got -- in my prepared remarks earlier, but what we got in this acquisition upfront is just amazing. And so I feel really confident in our plans -- in the plans that we've announced and our ability to execute because of what we bought. It's kind of that simple.  I know as I compare these to the Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars acquisitions, there are great similarities and there's some dissimilarities. I'd say Pixar and Marvel and Star Wars were probably more brand-focused, although in Pixar's case, it came with a solution to basically addressing the problems we have been having at Disney Animation. Marvel and Star Wars were brands. They're both about people as well; franchises long-term value. Here, we get a little bit of everything. We get some really strong brands: Nat Geo, Simpsons, good example of that. But we also have brands that we feel we can even strengthen by fueling them with more resources to create more product using those brands and put them front and center of our new platforms. I've talked about a lot of them in the past. And in all cases, I'd say we got great people, and that's very, very evident to us today. And also the other thing that's happening is how quickly we've been able to integrate not only the assets, but the people into our plans. I'd say if I'm pleasantly surprised -- one thing I'm most surprised about in a positive sense is how quickly we put people in significant positions of leadership in the company that can not only help manage our businesses today, but manage our businesses into the future.\nChristine McCarthy: So Ben, let me address your questions on synergy and the balance sheet. First of all, in synergy, we're still on track to deliver the 2 -- at least $2 billion in cost synergies related to the acquisition. We told you initially that you should expect us to realize about half of those benefits by the first full year and the remainder in the second full year. And once again, the $2 billion in cost synergies never included anything from the RSN, so that's immaterial to us achieving this $2 billion going forward. The other thing I've mentioned, and you'll see it in the press release and more disclosure in the Q, you saw some charges taken for restructuring. That number was 6 62.  We'll continue to take those charges as we continue to achieve those synergies, and you'll be able to follow it quarter-by-quarter. On the balance sheet side, we did significantly increase our debt portfolio. At the close, we had about $18 billion of long-term debt. And with the increment of debt and related positions coming from other entities, the balance -- the debt portfolio went up to about $52 billion. That's a number that our treasury group has been managing, too. We did some bond exchanges leading up to the close of the acquisition. So we're aggressively managing that portfolio in the same manner in which we have always managed the balance of short-term and long-term liquidity management and the way we positioned that balance sheet. On the -- you're probably also curious about leverage, and we have not recommenced any share buyback because we said we would not be doing that until our leverage ratios came back in line with that of the single A company. So for the time being, you can assume that our share repurchases will be suspended.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Just maybe returning to the parks. It seems like you have so many drivers right now, especially in front of the Star Wars Lands plural openings. So can you give us color on how you're thinking about pricing, particularly given the past year's price increase, which have no negative impact, impact that we could see on attendance; the timing of the second major attraction at the Star Wars Lands; and maybe some insight, how you're thinking about expanding in China over time. I know attendance has been weak recently.\nRobert Iger: Okay. Multifaceted question. On the first question, the parks, I'll start with pricing. We have been very strategic at our approach to pricing over the last number of years, and it's really paying off. The results this quarter certainly are evidence of that. And what we're trying to the basically is 2 things, is to price according to demand, and in managing demand, try to basically spread out attendance so that we can preserve or improve the guest experience; it's that simple. The popularity of what we've been building, which I think is tied to both the quality and the scale of what we've been building, but also the fact that we've been building attractions in lands and shows, et cetera that are tied to some of our best stories and our franchises, I think has created an even greater demand and more popularity, which gives us more flexibility on the pricing side. But it's not just about raising prices, it's about being really smart about it, and it's showing.  We have, as you know, Jessica, a tremendous amount of expansion going on. Star Wars Land is only one of them, and there are two of them, I should say. We're breaking ground on a big project in Tokyo just in 1.5 weeks, for instance, so we're building cruise ships, and we've got expansion just about every place that we operate. Specifically in China, where business actually has been quite good lately, we have announced that we're expanding with the Zootopia Land. I don't believe we've announced the date for that yet, but we're continuing to look at expansion. And right now, our plans for expansion there are solely focused on Shanghai. We've now talked about building at another location at this point. By the way, going back to Galaxy's Edge and Star Wars, the lands which are attractions themselves, have two e-ticket attractions. One is the Millennium Falcon experience or ride that I've tried a number of times, and it's fantastic. We're opening with that. The second attraction will open later in the year, but we've not said when. And as I've mentioned on my call, the Star Wars Land or Galaxy's Edge will open in Orlando at the end of August. Did I cover all the aspects of that question?\nChristine McCarthy: Jessica, I would just add one thing on margins. Since I have been in this role, I think any time a question came up about the growth in the parks' margins, it was usually asked in the vein of, can this margin improvement continue. And I just want to say that while we don't give any guidance on margins, there's nothing structural that would prevent our margins growing from here. And as Bob articulated, the growth -- the yield strategy is something that benefits the parks on multiple levels, spreading the demand, improving the guest experience, and also driving to the bottom line. We also see further potential for improvement in our international parks businesses and also managing our cost base effectively by deploying capital and labor efficiently. So I don't think there's any -- there's no constraint right now that we believe on our parks margins.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.\nAlexia Quadrani: On the studio side, after the fantastic Endgame, it's kind of hard to imagine there's more to come from Marvel, but I'm sure there is. I guess when do you think we'll get an update on the longer-term slate there? And then a follow-up question, staying on the studio, how much opportunity do you think there is on the film side of Fox, taking their IP and refining it further over the years to the success level more in line with Disney's historical portfolio.\nRobert Iger: We announced -- in announcing our new slate, I think we announced 2 or 3, maybe three new Marvel titles, but didn't say what they were. No Marvel dates, rather, without the titles. We obviously know what they are. And there's a lot of speculation online. So Alexia, if you go online, you may be able to get some of the answers. But Marvel didn't give me permission to announce it today because they want to announce it. I'm guessing they're going to do so later this summer. If you watch -- and I hope you did, Avengers: Endgame, there were a lot of clues in that film as to the movies that may be coming, but I'm not at liberty to help you with those either. I guess I'm just a Marvel guy when it comes to protecting their secrets. There are huge opportunities. When we brought Marvel, we started studying their characters.  And when we got to about 8,000, we stopped. But there are many, many different directions that we can go. We've obviously laid a lot of pipe in terms of characters and character story -- stories, even though we kind of came to an end on some of them, in this film, there are more possibilities, certainly beyond it. And then of course, on the television side, as we announced when we had our Disney+ presentation, Marvel is going to be making a series for a Loki. We're doing Winter Soldier -- Falcon and Winter Soldier, we're doing one with Wanda and Vision. And all of these are intricately linked and tied to the storytelling in the films. And so we're now looking at basically telling Marvel stories and being somewhat platform-agnostic. We'll make big films for the obvious reason, but those films will also live on the Disney+ platform in the stories we tell, in the series that we create. And no one's really doing that right now. As it relates to Fox, there are a number of different opportunities.  Clearly, our library titles that were never going to be made as sequels or as remakes for theatrical distribution that we're going to look at for a possible production inclusion in Disney+, but there's also sort of richness of development and storytelling for theatrical release using the Fox brand. And Emma Watts is reporting to Alan Bergman and Alan Horn. As we're working to develop those, we inherited a slate of films that are being made. We're bringing them to the system, and we're now working with her to help -- to basically determine the slate beyond what's been announced, and I'm guessing that it'll be somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 or 6 films a year. But we're not locking ourselves into that, from that end. And of course, we have Searchlight, which is going to continue their business as is.\nChristine McCarthy: Alexia, before you go, I just want to add one thing on Avengers: Endgame. And I said a very similar thing a year ago as it related to Avenger's Infinity War. Given the size of the cast involved and anyone who's seen it, knows that the cast was extremely large, and the cost to produce a film of that scale of magnitude and length, while we expect the results for this film to be terrific, they will be tempered somewhat by the cost structure. And I said the exact same thing as it related to Infinity War.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson LLC.\nMichael Nathanson: So one for you Bob and one for your Christine. Bob, at Investor Day, one thing that didn't come was China. And I look at parks you have there and how well Marvel does, how are you thinking about the OTT opportunities for China? And then for Christine, in answering Ben's question, you want to get to a single-A credit, when do you think you'll hit that threshold in the coming years?\nRobert Iger: Michael, right now, there are regulations in China that might limit what we can do from an OTT perspective. Certainly, what we can do on our own, we'd have to -- at this point, if we're going to launch something, it'd have to be with a local partner and shared ownership. So we're going to have to work our way through that. We certainly believe there are opportunities. Interestingly, if you look at the performance of Avengers: Endgame -- I was going to mention this as it related to Shanghai. But Marvel has gotten extremely popular in China, and I think this film has already done somewhere in the neighborhood of $600 million in box office -- dollars in box office in China already, and it's just enormously popular. So the idea of bringing the Marvel television shows to China as part of a direct-to-consumer platform or proposition is something that we're very, very interested in. And as it relates specifically to Shanghai, we think we have a huge opportunity for Marvel there. We built something somewhat temporary in nature, just a tent that features Marvel franchises and characters, because when we began designing the park in Shanghai, it was only soon after really we had purchased Marvel, and we went in early enough to do it. But there are great opportunities long term given the affinity people have in China for these characters. That's a hint to our parks and resorts group. We should be hard at work already designing and developing some Marvel presence in Shanghai. They're listening, I know.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. Now onto the more exciting leverage question, Michael. Let me just say that the -- that our approach to our physical discipline, it has not changed. It's just that we're managing more. But we're right now in the middle of our long-range planning process, which will be followed by our annual process. We'll work through this between -- over the next few months, and we'll have more clarity on it probably by next earnings release. However, what I would say is that we've -- the rating agencies maintain a very solid working relationship with the company. In particular, the treasury team. And they have all been apprised of the activities around the company, not only on our own, but also with closing and with the integration of Fox. And you can see where their positioning us, which is maintaining us at our current ratings level. We have every intention of bringing that down as quickly as possible, but we're going to balance that with investing in our businesses to create that long-term shareholder value.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Marci Ryvicker with Wolfe Research.\nMarci Ryvicker: Going back to the DTC Analyst Day, I think there was a lot more content available on Disney+ than the Street had been expecting, at least in the first year. So is this just a timing of when the content slowing in from your contracts? Or did you have to negotiate with third-party distributors to get that content back earlier?\nRobert Iger: We did some deals, Marci, to get some of the content back that had been licensed to third parties. We continue to explore ways that we might be able to get more back. But what we announced at Investor Day included some of the rights that we've managed to buy back or negotiate back from what had been licensed to third parties. And there's still some out there that we're exploring.\nMarci Ryvicker: Okay. And then what happens with content in the P2 window? So if you get content from Netflix, does it go back to them? Or do you keep it for forever?\nRobert Iger: I don't want get too specific on that, but there was a window in the Netflix deal that enable us access to some of the films, so it's the films that we were licensing to them, and again, I don't want to get more specific than that. But when we did the Netflix deal some -- way back, we envisioned, even though it was at that point, far off, the possibility that one day we might want to launch our own service. So we carved out an ability to run some of the films on such a service, and it did pay off.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays.\nKannan Venkateshwar: I guess a couple. First on the KPIs for DTC going forward, just wanted to understand what kind of metrics we should be tracking in order to figure out the progress. I mean, Disney+, of course, doesn't launch until later in the year. But would you be helping us with subscribers on the Hulu front or on the ESPN+ front? And the second question is, when we look at film margins of Fox, that's significantly lower than Disney, and I know you don't manage studios from margins. But the delta is just very big, and it could be $1 billion-plus opportunity over time on the margin front. So just wanted to figure out how you're thinking about margins on the studio side for film.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. Let me take first this sub-question. As you saw in the Investor Day, we have committed to being very transparent as it relates to our strategy and our progress in our direct-to-consumer initiative. As you mentioned, Disney+ is not yet launched, there's nothing to report. But as we get further into the latter part of the calendar year, while we haven't -- not going to commit to exactly when, we will be providing sub-numbers going forward at the appropriate time as well as some of the other metrics that we spelled out on the Investor Day. So once again, our commitment is to transparency to allow you to understand the progress that we're making in this business. It's very important to us. And on the theatrical side, we do manage our studio to margins and returns more specifically. We look at those returns on a regular basis. We update them at when a film is in its early runs. But it's very much a return-driven business.\nRobert Iger: And we would hope to bring that same approach, that same discipline to the Fox Studios.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nDouglas Mitchelson: So one for Bob, one for Christine. Bob, for Hulu, does the expansion of your non-Disney+ entertainment content require you to own 100% of Hulu if you want to take that internationally? And so if I ask that right, do you need to own all of Hulu to do Hulu international? And pushing that further, because I imagine you're going to say you don't need to. Disney+ has numerous advantages. You laid those out of the Analyst Day. How do you think about the Hulu opportunity overseas and how that service would be differentiated? And any timing on that? I imagine it will be a couple years before enough content is available. And for Christine, Bob talked about the Fox Film slate coming down to 5 or so films a year ex Fox Searchlight. Fewer films will reduce cost a lot in the Fox Studios side. Does the $2 billion of cost synergies include that sort of bringing down the number of films at Fox? Or should we think about those more as sort of core SG&A and other OpEx-type items?\nRobert Iger: Doug, first of all, we're bullish about Hulu for a number of reasons, but mostly because as we see it, it's the best consumer television proposition out there because it offers linear channels that include a lot of live news and sports, in-season stacking of network programming, a lot of great original programming, and then, of course, a lot of library beyond just the network library in season that I suggested. With Comcast as basically a 33% owner, any big decisions that are made as it relates to investment or expansion would have to be done with their cooperation. And again, I think we would probably both share a bullish outlook about Hulu, but we can't do it on our own.\nChristine McCarthy: And Doug, as it relates to the studio and where it factors in with the $2 billion of synergies, at the time that we announced the transaction, that was the number, and it did include the studio. It included a reduction in output as well as 2 studios that had a significant amount of overlap. With overlap came redundancies, and that's all part of the cost synergies that were well on the way of realizing for the studio.\nDouglas Mitchelson: And Christine, if I could just follow up real quick. The $0.35 Fox solution for the fiscal third quarter, I imagine, is sort of unusually high. Just want -- can you confirm that you're still targeting Fox being accretive by fiscal '21?\nChristine McCarthy: As I mentioned earlier, we are in the early stage -- well in the middle of, not early stages, in the middle of our long-range planning which will go out within the next couple of years, probably in greater detail than we would do if we had not done this acquisition. But we're in the middle of doing that. So to the extent to which there's any refinement of the accretion dilution, we'll report it at the right point in time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS.\nJohn Hodulik: Bob, it looks like the NFL's going to move forward with a digital version of the Sunday ticket. Couple of questions from that. First of all, is that a set of rights that could possibly be a good fit for ESPN+? Or are you still sort of focused on second and third-tier rights? And two, does that change your view on, say, the value of the broadcast NFL packages? And then if I could ask just one follow-up, Fox just announced an equity stake in Stars Group to pursue sports gambling and sort of leverage their existing set of sports rights. And I know you've said that, that's not something that you had on the drawing board. But as you look out and becomes more mainstream, is that something that you could potentially revisit?\nRobert Iger: Well, on the gambling front, we've said, and actually we've already done some things that we would integrate it into our programming, but not to the extent that we would be facilitating gambling as an entity. In other words, we'll provide programming that will, I guess, be designed to enlighten people who are betting on sports. But that's as far as we would go. And I think you'll see more of it integrated in the programming, but we just don't intend to go into the gambling business. On Sunday ticket, I think I'd rather -- I'm not going to elaborate much except that there have been some exploration as to whether there was an opportunity there, but I'm going to leave it at that. And we're very bullish on the NFL. By the way, we got a great schedule this coming year. But we're bullish on the relationship ESPN has with the NFL. And I think we all believe that there are opportunities to strengthen our relationship with them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Nollen with Macquarie.\nTimothy Nollen: My question is back on the subject of Hulu, if that's okay. News of AT&T selling out and then some discussion of Comcast considering selling. I just wonder, if you lose any partners, what happens to the content that they are contributing to the platform? Do you still get a lot of that Warner content for a long period of time? Does it fall off? And likewise, if Comcast were to drop off, I'm assuming the answer is they won't do that. But if they were to, what would happen to their content in Hulu?\nRobert Iger: Well, obviously Warner has sold their stake to us -- or AT&T Time Warner sold their stake to us. And I can't get specific about what was tied to that, but there were some ongoing relationship as it related to their product including their channels. And as it relates to the other question and maybe going back to the one that was asked earlier, we're 2/3 owner of Hulu. So the big decisions that are made, there's a vote that is to occur. But we're going to be mindful of how that's managed knowing that we have a fiduciary responsibility to the third-party owner, to Comcast, 33%. And I would imagine -- and I think we've publicly confirmed that there have been -- there has been dialogue with Comcast about them possibly divesting their stake. And you can expect that if that were to occur, there probably would be some ongoing relationship as it resulted to programming.\nTimothy Nollen: Okay. So even if you have lost AT&T, Warner as a part owner and the possibility of Comcast leaving, it still means you have a lot, if not all of the content that they were providing for some fairly long period of time?\nRobert Iger: I'm not going to get more specific than that, so I can't help you at all in terms of your assumptions beyond what I just said.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alan Gould with Loop Capital.\nAlan Gould: Bob, you talked about China possibly expanding a Marvel land. I've never seen a series as successful as Marvel. I believe you have the rights west to the Mississippi. Is there any thoughts of having a Marvel land in the U.S.?\nRobert Iger: We're building a considerable Marvel presence at Disneyland as we speak. And as I don't remember how specific we've gotten about what's in it, but I was there last week, 1.5 weeks, and there's a lot of construction going on. I just have to check. I just don't recall whether we've been specific about what's in it. There are -- I think actually I saw an image online recently of a design concept, but I don't know whether that was leaked or not. We have said that -- and we already have a Guardians of the Galaxy presence as we converted Tower of Terror, and there'll be a Spider-Man attraction as part of the expansion that I'm describing. We're also building a Guardians of the Galaxy coaster in -- at Epcot in Florida, where there are more restrictions to the question that you asked than we have in California. And then in China, we don't have any restrictions. So I imagine we're, at some point, going to get very ambitious about what we do with Marvel at Shanghai Disneyland.\nLowell Singer: Alan, thank you.

Everyone, have a wonderful day."}, {"symbol": "DIS", "quarter": 1, "year": 2019, "date": "2019-02-05 22:01:19", "content": "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's Fiscal First Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nLowell Singer: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast, and a transcript of the call will be available on our website. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Bob will lead off, followed by Christine, and then, of course, we'll be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob, and we'll get started.\nRobert Iger: Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon. Before Christine talks about the quarter, I have just a few comments about what we're working on and what we're excited about. First, I'd like to congratulate our studio for its 17 Oscar nominations, seven of which went to Marvel's Black Panther, including a historic nomination for Best Picture. Together, Disney and 21st Century Fox received 37 nominations, an indication of the creative potential of the combined companies. As you know, DTC remains our number one priority. Our corporate reorganization was designed to support our DTC efforts while providing a greater degree of transparency into our investment and our progress in the space. We remain focused on the programming as well as the technology to drive the success of our DTC business, and we're thrilled with the continued growth of ESPN+. The very first UFC Fight Night under our new five year rights deal led nearly 600,000 fans to sign up for the service. The fact that 49 million Americans, 15% of the entire population watched ESPN content on linear TV that day and millions more engaged on other platforms including ESPN+ speaks to the enduring power of live sports, the strength of the ESPN brand and the value of the UFC rights we acquired. We expect the expansion of combat sports content on the streaming service to drive continued growth in the months ahead. ESPN+ now has 2 million paid subscriptions, double the number from just five months ago. ESPN+ operates on BAMTech's platform, which has proved to be reliably stable during peak live streaming consumption and easily handled the volume of more than 0.5 million people signing up in a single 24-hour period. This same technology will power Disney+ when it launches later this year. We have a number of great creative engines across our company, all of which are dedicating their talent, focus and resources to develop and produce strong content for the Disney+ platform. Most of the teams creating shows and movies for this service are the same innovators and storytellers driving the prolific success of Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm, operating under the same expectations of excellence. We look forward to leveraging National Geographic to provide even more unique content for Disney+. Presented with an overabundance of choice, consumers look to brands they know to sort through the options and find what they actually want. The DTC space is no different in that regard and we're confident that our iconic brands and franchises will allow us to effectively break through the competitive clutter and connect with consumers. We'll also use our brands to help subscribers quickly navigate the content on Disney+, creating an efficient interface that enhances their experience and their affinity for the service. We'll demonstrate the Disney+ platform and showcase some of the original content we're creating for it at our Investor Day on April 11. We'll also take that opportunity to provide detailed insight into our overall DTC business. The addition of content and management talent from 21st Century Fox will further enhance our DTC efforts and provide opportunities for growth across the company. Having already designed much of the integration process, we are prepared to start effectively combining our businesses as soon as we obtain regulatory approval from the last few remaining markets. We look forward to working with the tremendous teams at 21st Century Fox to create the world's premier global entertainment company. I'm now going to turn the call over to Christine, and then I'll be back to take your questions.\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.84. These results represent a strong start to the fiscal year when you consider the headwinds we faced in the quarter, including comparisons to a very strong Q1 at the studio last year, higher programming expense at ESPN in Q1 this year due to the timing of the College Football Playoffs and continued investment in our direct-to-consumer businesses that we expect will drive meaningful future growth. Last year, we announced a reorganization of our company into four segments, Media Networks, the combined Parks, Experiences & Consumer Products, Studio Entertainment, and the newly formed Direct-to-Consumer & International. And several weeks ago, we filed three years of historical financial information, reflecting this new segment structure, which should help provide some context around our Q1 results. At Studio Entertainment, higher TV, SVOD and home entertainment results were more than offset by lower worldwide theatrical results, reflecting the phenomenal performance of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Thor: Ragnarok and Coco last year compared to Ralph Breaks the Internet, Mary Poppins Returns and The Nutcracker and the Four Realms this year. Our worldwide theatrical results were in line with the outlook we provided on our Q4 earnings call. Given our studio's record performance in fiscal 2018, the difficult studio comp will continue in the second quarter. We have two releases during the second quarter: the highly anticipated Captain Marvel, which, by the way, is our first female-led superhero film and a live action adaptation of the animated classic, Dumbo. Dumbo will be released at the end of the second quarter, so all of the film's prerelease marketing expense will be incurred in the quarter with only two days of box office. As a reminder, last year's second quarter theatrical results included the outstanding performance of Black Panther and the carryover performance of Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Coco. Home entertainment results also faced a difficult comparison, given Q2 titles last year included Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Thor: Ragnarok and Coco. As a result, we expect operating income from our theatrical and home entertainment businesses to be $450 million to $500 million lower than in Q2 last year, which was the best second quarter in the studio's history. At Parks, Experiences & Consumer Products operating income growth was driven by higher results at our domestic theme parks and resorts, partially offset by lower merchandise licensing and international park results. Growth in operating income at our domestic parks business was driven by higher guest spending at the park and higher occupied room nights at the hotels. Attendance at our domestic parks was comparable to the first quarter last year. However, per capita spending was up 7% on higher admissions, food and beverage and merchandise spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 5%, and occupancy was up 3 percentage points to 94%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 4% compared to prior year, while booked rates are up 1%. Results at our international operations were lower in the first quarter versus last year as growth at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was offset by lower results at Shanghai Disney Resort and Disneyland Paris. Lower operating income from merchandise licensing primarily reflects strong sales of Star Wars and Cars merchandise in the first quarter last year. The theatrical success of Star Wars: The Last Jedi in Q1 last year was a key driver to licensing results, so the absence of a comparable franchise title in Q1 this year created a meaningful headwind to our licensing results. These results were partially offset by higher minimum guarantee revenue due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standards. Total segment operating income margin was up 160 basis points compared to Q1 last year, driven by about 340 basis points of margin growth at our domestic parks and experiences business. Turning to Media Networks. Operating income was higher in the first quarter as growth in broadcasting more than offset a decline at cable. Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 7% in the quarter due to growth at both cable and broadcasting. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by 7 points of growth due to higher rates and 1 point of growth due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standards, partially offset by approximately a 1 point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. The sub trend improved modestly, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of improvement in the rate of net subscriber declines. Broadcasting delivered a strong quarter driven by growth in affiliate and advertising revenue and higher program sales compared to Q1 last year. Higher affiliate revenue was driven by contractual rate increases and benefited from the adoption of new revenue recognition standards. Broadcasting advertising revenue was up 6% in the first quarter, driven by higher network rates and increased political advertising at our TV stations, partially offset by lower network impressions. Quarter-to-date, prime time scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running 40% above upfront levels. Higher program sales were primarily due to increased revenue from licensed programs to Hulu and the sale of Marvel's The Punisher in the quarter and no comparable sale in Q1 last year. Domestic cable results were lower in the quarter as higher operating income at the Disney Channel was more than offset by a decline at domestic ESPN and Freeform. At ESPN, operating income was lower in the first quarter as higher affiliate and advertising revenue was more than offset by higher programming and production costs. As I mentioned at the outset, ESPN's programming costs were higher in the quarter, driven primarily by the timing shift of the College Football semifinal games. ESPN aired three of the New Year's six bowl games during the first quarter, similar to last year. However, this year, two of those bowls were semifinal games, whereas the semifinal games aired during the second quarter last year. In addition, contractual rate increases for NFL, college sports and NBA programming also contributed to programming expense growth in the quarter. ESPN's domestic linear advertising revenue was up 3% in the first quarter and reflects a benefit of the shift of the College Football semifinal games. This ad revenue stream is reported within Media Networks and does not include any ad revenue generated by the international channels or domestic addressable advertising revenue as those are now reported in the Direct-to-Consumer & International segment. If you add the domestic addressable revenue generated by ESPN, then ESPN's total domestic advertising revenue was up 5%. So far this quarter, ESPN's domestic cash ad sales are pacing down 2% compared to last year, reflecting the absence of the College Football Playoff semifinal games that shifted into Q1 this year. Turning to Consumer & International. Growth at our international channels and lower equity losses from our investment in Hulu were more than offset by ongoing investments in our direct-to-consumer businesses, which reflect content, distribution and marketing expense at ESPN+ and costs associated with the upcoming launch of Disney+. While our share of equity losses from our investment in Hulu is reported within DTCI, I'll remind you that the overall impact of Hulu on the company's results includes revenue from program sales as well as affiliate and advertising revenue. Over the past three years, our aggregate equity losses have largely been offset by these revenue streams. Results in the quarter also reflect lower operating income from BAMTech's third-party technology services business. Last quarter, we mentioned the continued ramp-up of the ESPN+ would have an adverse impact on operating income of about $100 million for the first quarter. The actual number came in a bit better than that, though, we expect ongoing investments in our direct-to-consumer businesses to continue to impact DTCI's financial results. In the second quarter, we expect the continued ramp-up of ESPN+ and ongoing development of our Disney+ service to have an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income of about $200 million, with about two thirds of that attributable to ESPN+. Overall, we feel good about the start of the fiscal year and are excited for the opportunities ahead of us. While our full year results will be influenced by the timing of the 21st Century Fox acquisition, in addition to the studio and DTCI items I mentioned, I'll highlight a couple of additional items that will affect the comparability of our second quarter results. First, at Parks, Experiences & Consumer Products, while the adoption of new revenue recognition standards benefited licensing Q1 results, in Q2, the new revenue standard will result in an $80 million operating income headwind. Also, the Easter holiday period will fall entirely in Q3, whereas last year, one week of the holiday period fell in Q2. We estimate this will result in about $45 million in operating income shifting from Q2 to Q3. And at broadcasting, we face a difficult program sales comparison that we expect to have a negative impact of about $85 million on operating income. Lower program sales are due in part to a shift in the timing of the sale of Marvel's Jessica Jones as last year, we recognized the sale of season two during the second quarter, whereas this year, we expect to recognize the sale of season three during the third quarter. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell, and we'd be more than happy to take your questions.\nLowell Singer: All right, Christine, thank you. And operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. I have two for Bob or Christine. So Bob, thanks for the update on ESPN+, that was helpful. And I wonder, now that you're launched for about nine months, what has surprised you about that launch? And what can you take in terms of lessons learned that could apply to Disney+? And then the second question is, there seems to be a lot of controversy on The Street about the size of the revenue displacement from basically foregoing license revenue at Disney as you move to Disney+. Can you talk a bit about the size of that displacement of foregone licensing and maybe the timing of that impact to help us think about how this phases out over time?\nRobert Iger: So the first part of your question, Michael, I'd say that what we've learned, which is extremely valuable as it relates to future launches, particularly at Disney+, is that the BAMTech platform that we invested in when we bought BAM is an extremely robust platform, capable of handling not only scale in terms of live streaming simultaneously but a substantial number of transactions in a very short period of time. I mean, there were times before the UFC fight that BAMTech was taking in or making just under 15,000 transactions a minute, and the stability of the platform is critical in times like that. We also learned, which is not really unexpected but we saw it in real time, that ESPN's primary platforms are fantastic marketing tools for the direct-to-consumer service, and you can obviously expect that we will use Disney's strong marketing platforms for the Disney+ service. We also feel that the consumers had a good experience not just in terms of the ability to watch live events under high quality circumstances on mobile devices but, in general, the price-to-value relationship seems very strong. And I'd say lastly, the brand is very strong as well. So if you consider all of that, the fact that we have a technology platform that's working, a user interface that's working, the ability to sign consumers up en masse, the use of the primary platforms to promote the new platform in what we believe will be a strong price to value relationship with Disney and then the strength of all the brands, I think it all adds up to a very, very positive picture ahead of the launch of the Disney service, which is going to come toward the end of this calendar year.\nChristine McCarthy: Michael, I'll take the question on foregone licensing. When you look at the foregone licensing, it's going to cross over two segments, our Media Networks and the studio. When you look at fiscal '19, that licensing revenue in combination net of APR, we estimate would be a decrease of about $150 million to OI year-over-year. That will be more heavily weighted to the second half.\nRobert Iger: Absolutely. $150 million.\nChristine McCarthy: $150 million. That will be weighted to the second half. And to put some context on that, Captain Marvel, which is coming out in this second quarter, is the first film that we will withhold from our output deals. So that's where you can see the foregone licensing revenue begin.\nMichael Nathanson: Okay. And when you talk about the whole year, what do you have in the third and fourth quarter, too?\nChristine McCarthy: No, the $150 million is for the full fiscal year.\nMichael Nathanson: For the whole year? Okay. That's great.\nChristine McCarthy: Yes.\nRobert Iger: Okay. Michael, thanks. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you so much. It's just two questions. I guess, the first one is somewhat similar to Michael's but maybe a much more broader perspective. I'm curious if you can talk broadly because I know you'll give lot of specifics in April. How you - Bob, I guess, how you balance your existing business and the direct to consumer initiatives? I guess, in many facets, how you balance potentially more aggressive investment spending versus maybe providing the shareholders earnings growth that some of your shareholders will be looking for. And perhaps more specifically along the same topics, thoughts on changing the home video window versus to potentially boost interest in Disney+?\nRobert Iger: Thanks, Alexia. As I mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks, we have an event on April 11 when we're not only going to demonstrate the app, but we're going to talk in great detail about our strategy, the impact of our current businesses and the impact on our bottom line. And so I think we'll answer a lot of the questions then. But what we're basically trying to do here is invest in our future. And the investments that we're making in both the technology side and in creating incremental content are all designed so that long-term this business will become an important part of Disney's bottom line and long-term strategy So I think you have to look at this. It's almost the equivalent of deploying capital to build out our theme parks when we could have deployed the capital in a variety of other directions. This is a bet on the future of this business. And we are deploying our capital basically so that long term, the growth of this company is stronger than it would have been without these investments. In terms of making the decisions about where content goes near term or today versus traditional platforms, first of all, since we are betting on this direct to consumer business long term, we obviously have to fuel it with intellectual property. And so we're creating intellectual property incremental to the properties or the product that we're making for our traditional platforms just so that we can launch this product. And then in some cases, we're moving product over that perhaps could have been on traditional platforms. And again, we're doing that because it's a capital allocation in the direction of long-term growth for the company. I won't get into the issues as it relates to the windows, but we're not looking to compress the theatrical window here. There might be an opportunity down the road to adjust the windowing in terms of when we bring product from [Technical Difficulty] maybe the home video window into the so-called pay window. But initially, we're approaching this under relatively traditional lines from a calendar perspective. And then I think the last thing that I should add, and I think this includes the assets that we're buying from 21st Century Fox, is we had in The Walt Disney Company not only a collection of brands and we're adding to them with National Geographic and FX and Searchlight, et cetera and so on but we have talent, both executive talent - talent relationships and production capabilities that give us the ability to scale up nicely in terms of our output and not invest that much in overhead or infrastructure to do that. And so we're going to leverage the people and the capabilities of all of our traditional media businesses we're doing today to grow the product with some incremental expense obviously to produce the product, but very efficiently but to grow product for the new platforms.\nAlexia Quadrani: And I guess, just a quick follow-up on that. I believe you licensed a show, I may be wrong, from CBS TV studios for Disney+. Is the strategy - I guess, maybe just to your earlier comment, where, in some exceptions, you'll sort of look outside or make incremental expenses. Is the strategy just to find the best content, it doesn't have to be always internally sourced?\nRobert Iger: I think the strategy will be, long term, pretty heavily weighted to internally sourced versus externally sourced. There will be occasion when we would be glad to license from third parties. But because the Fox deal hasn't closed yet, so we can't take advantage of some of their output capabilities. And because we need to launch the service with some volume and it takes time to ramp up, we're buying certain products from the outside opportunistically, and we'll continue to do that. By the way, this is something we've done in our parks for a long time, where we licensed from George Lucas Star Tours or the Star Wars IP or the Indiana Jones IP or the Avatar IP. We'll continue to look at opportunities that we think we can leverage because there is a potential consumer demand for it.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you very much.\nRobert Iger: Thanks, Alexia. Next question please, operator.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you Bob, can you give us an update on your outlook for Hulu? In particular, they reported some pretty strong subscriber growth. Last year, it made some pricing changes. How bullish are you on this business? And can you give us any sense for sort of the opportunity to turn this business profitable, because, while it's got real scale in subs and revenue, we all know it's generating losses today? And maybe you could tie Hulu into the broader go to market with Disney+. How do you think about leveraging Disney's sort of broad - maybe global customer relationships you have today to get Disney+ off the ground quickly?\nRobert Iger: The goal obviously is to operate Hulu profitably and we're not going to say how long that might take. That could shift a bit because, at some point, we'll look more aggressively at some international rollouts of Hulu as well. And I think it's also premature to discuss much about Hulu because, until the Fox deal closes, we only own 30% of it. We'll own 60% when the deal closes, and we'll be prepared to talk more, perhaps, about Hulu's strategy at that point. But what we said when we decided to launch ESPN+ and Disney+ is that rather than creating one gigantic fat bundle of sports, general entertainment programming and family programming, we thought we'd serve the consumer better by segregating all three. Ultimately, our goal would be to use the same tech platform to make it easier for people to sign up for all three should they want to, same credit card, same username, same password, et cetera, but give the consumer the kind of choice that we think consumers are going to demand more and more in today's world. If they wanted to buy all three, we'd give them that opportunity, potentially at a discount, or two for that matter. But if they wanted to buy one of them, we believe they should be able to. So someone who wants sports should be able to buy just sports and so on. In terms of going back to the first part of the question in terms of profitability - well, actually in terms of our belief in the platform, there's enough out there in your sector and ours, meaning in media and in the businesses that follow media that have been talking about direct to consumer growth. And we see that obviously with some of the big players in the space, notably Netflix. We think there's huge potential for Hulu to grow as well as for the other services to grow and plenty of room for other entrants in the marketplace. But we aim to take advantage of, on the Disney and the ESPN side, our brands and that expertise. And on the Hulu side, we hope to take advantage of the fact that they've already launched successfully and their brand is starting to build some equity, but also in the production capabilities of the businesses that we have, including the businesses that we're buying.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you very much.\nRobert Iger: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks very much. One for Bob, one for Christine, and I am going to boldly try to stay away from streaming questions. Bob, as sports gambling becomes legal in the U.S. state-by-state, is that something that can coexist within the family-friendly Disney brand that's the umbrella for the company? I'm asking in part because of the addition of the UFC and some of the Fox content like shows at FX and Deadpool are already pushing the envelope a bit, perhaps. So maybe sports gambling does fit in and could be an interesting long-term opportunity. And Christine, on the impact of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge lands launching, in the past, when you've launched lands, there was often a ramp in OpEx and marketing in advance of those lands. As we think about profitability or park margins for the year or the second half as these start to come in on the West Coast and then, later in the year, in Orlando, any comments as to whether those are - start out profitable off the bat because it's their largest lands and it's a big brand or is that something that we should really look towards fiscal '20? Thank you.\nRobert Iger: Doug, well, I understand the sort of connection you made to gambling and to Deadpool. I think that we look at them in very different ways. I don't see The Walt Disney Company, certainly in the near term, getting involved in the business of gambling, in effect, by facilitating gambling in any way. I do think that there's plenty of room, and ESPN has done some of this already and they may do more to provide information in coverage of sports, as a for instance, that would be relevant to and of particular interest to gambling and not be shy about it, basically being fairly overt about it. But getting into the business of gambling, I rather doubt it. We do believe there is room for the Fox properties to exist without significant Disney influence over the nature of the content, meaning that we see that there is certainly popularity amongst Marvel fans for the R-rated Deadpool films, as a for instance. We're going to continue in that business, and there might be room for more of that. And there's nothing that we've really seen in the Fox either library or in the activities that Fox is engaging in today from a standards perspective that would be of concern to us as long as we're very carefully branding them and making sure that we're not in any way confusing the consumer with product that would be sort of either Disney product or the more traditional Marvel product.\nDoug Mitchelson: Understood.\nChristine McCarthy: So Doug, on the opening of the two Star Wars lands, Galaxy's Edge in both the Disneyland Park, initially, at Anaheim, followed later in the fiscal year at Walt Disney World, we have not given any guidance or outlook on operating expenses that we'll incur in addition to the normal operating expenses as they ramp up. However, you've seen those expenses increase when we've opened lands. So that will be just embedded in their operating income and in their expense lines. Both of those will open in the balance of this fiscal year skewed to the - calendar year, but it'll be skewed to the second half.\nRobert Iger: And I would say, by the way, on the marketing expense side, don't expect much. I'm thinking that maybe I should just tweet, \"It's opening,\" and that will be enough. I think we're going to end up with incredibly popular and in-demand product with these two new lands. They're large. They're beautiful, and they're extremely innovative. And they obviously leverage the popularity of the Star Wars brand. And I think that we're going to have absolutely no problem gaining attention for them or to them, and it's not going to take much marketing to do that. That's a signal that I just sent to our parks and resorts people to keep that budget really low.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thank you\nRobert Iger: All right. Doug, thanks. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Cahall with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is now open.\nSteven Cahall: Thank you. So maybe first, just a follow-up on that. I mean, it seems like you're really running the parks for yield. So was there anything specific in the quarter that contributed to the strong RevPAR or per capita spend that we shouldn't expect to roll through the rest of the year even with a little attendance lift from the opening of the Star Wars properties? And then secondly, Christine, I was wondering if maybe you could update us on what leverage is going to look like after the Fox transaction. I don't think you've done that since last summer, and a lot's changed since then, especially the divestitures. And maybe you don't have to give us an exact view on what the RSNs go for, but you must have maybe some idea of what net leverage looks like when you close the transaction? Thank you.\nRobert Iger: Steve, on the first part, we've been witnessing, over the last few years, a substantial increase in the popularity of our parks. A lot of that has to do with how well they've managed and the kind of investments that we've made not just operationally but in expansion and the use of IP that's extremely popular. In doing so, what we're also trying to do is to use that popularity to manage guest experience a little bit better in the sense that - and we know that crowding can be an issue, and that when our parks are the most crowded, the guest experience is not what we would like it to be. And so we're leveraging the popularity to obviously increase pricing and to spread demand, to get much more strategic about how we're pricing. So the parks are still accessible, but in the highest peak periods, we're trying basically to manage the attendance so that the guest experience isn't diminished by the popularity. And I think, because of the nature of the investments we're making, we've been fairly vocal and transparent about those investments, the two big Star Wars, Toy Story Land that just opened up in Florida, the work that's going on in Hong Kong and in Paris and Shanghai and in Tokyo and all the great expansion and IP that we're putting in. That popularity is going to continue, and with that's going to come the, I guess, enviable task of balancing that popularity with guest experience and price elasticity.\nChristine McCarthy: Steve, to answer your question on leverage, a couple of things I want to comment on. One is the 39% stake in Sky was divested. And while that cash is currently at 21st Century Fox, upon closing, that will move over to The Walt Disney Company. That will have a significant benefit in reducing our leverage back to the metrics that we have typically run the company, which is an A credit. The other thing that we are working on, and it's in progress so I'm not going to comment about it, but we are in the middle of divesting the RSNs. It is an auction process. There's a lot of chatter out in the market. I won't comment on it, just to say that not everything you hear is necessarily true, but it seems to be in the news pretty much every day currently. But that will also have a positive impact on decreasing our leverage. The three rating agencies who cover us, Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch, have all affirmed our ratings at the existing levels. And I think if you look at those, you'll see what their expectations are on the reduction of leverage. But we are looking forward to reestablishing our A credit metrics.\nSteven Cahall: Thank you\nRobert Iger: All right. Steve, thank you. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nTodd Juenger: Hi, thanks. One, hopefully very basic; and then one, a little more broad. Christine, I suppose, thank you for once again disclosing the pay universe sub trends on your affiliate fee line, and it sounded like they ticked better again slightly in the 1% range. Just wonder if you could help reconcile that for us at all when we see the reports from the cable satellite companies that look like they're shedding pay-TV customers at a faster rate but we're not seeing that in your numbers. So I don't know if you can help us reconcile that. Is there anything specific to the virtual MVPDs or to your specific portfolio of networks? That's supposed to be the fast question. Then the other one, I'll state it quicker, is just, Bob, I'm wondering, where do video games fit into your whole thought process going forward? You've tried to bring it in house. You've got license agreements. You've got partners. It's clearly a form of entertainment that is gathering lots of engagement. You've got lots of IP. Just wondering, with all your other things going on, if that's still on your radar and any updated thoughts on how you might participate? Thanks.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. I'll take the first one, Todd. As it relates to subs, the difference between what the cable operators report and what we report is it's a two month lag. We get the - they're giving you more up-to-date information. Ours is on a two month lag. However, as I mentioned in my comments, we've had six consecutive quarters of improved sub numbers, and we've had the dynamic of the loss of traditionals decreasing and the increase of digital MVPDs increasing. So the net-net of those are both going in the right direction, so we have seen that sequential improvement. But the difference between what Direct may be reporting or AT&T may be reporting as it relates to Direct or to their traditionals, it's not apples-to-apples on timing.\nRobert Iger: And on the video game business, we're obviously mindful of the size of that business. But over the years, as you know, we've tried our hand in self-publishing. We've bought companies. We've sold companies. We've bought developers. We've closed developers. And we found over the years that we haven't been particularly good at the self-publishing side, but we've been great at the licensing side, which obviously doesn't require that much allocation of capital. And since we're allocating capital in other directions, even though we certainly have the ability to allocate more capital, we've just decided that the best place for us to be in that space is licensing and not publishing. And we've had good relationships with some of those we're licensing to, notably EA and the relationship on the Star Wars properties. And we're probably going to continue - we're going to continue to stay in that side of the business and put our capital elsewhere. We're good at making movies and television shows and theme park attractions and cruise ships and the like, and we've just never managed to demonstrate much scale on the publishing side of games.\nTodd Juenger: Appreciate that. Thanks, both.\nRobert Iger: Thank you, Todd. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Your line is now open.\nTim Nollen: Thank you I've got two questions as well, please. First off, Christine, if I could just double check. I think you said ESPN outlook was up 3%, but if you include addressable advertising, which is on the DTC line, it was up 5%. Can you just maybe make sure I heard that - or the ESPN number? And if so, can you explain a bit more where that's coming from? Is that on traditional - on linear ESPN with some better dynamic insertion or anything more addressable or is it more on the ESPN+ service? And then a separate question on the parks side. I think this is the second quarter out of the last three or four that we've heard about Shanghai seeing some attendance declines. Could you please comment a bit more on that? Thanks.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. On the ESPN advertising, you're correct that the linear was up 3%, and that is reported in the Media Networks segment. The addressable advertising is recorded in - reported in our direct to consumer segment. The increase that we saw this quarter was because there were more ESPN impressions that they were able to monetize based on a higher level of user engagement. So they saw a nice uptick. So when you incorporated that - and this is just domestic. It doesn't include international, and I can comment on that in a minute. But the domestic, when you include that, equates to a 5% increase. The categories that were most frequent in the addressable advertising were from studios, video games and telecom. And that's pretty much what you would expect, given that it's addressable or digital. On the international side, there was a slight downtick, but that had everything to do with foreign exchange. ESPN's international business is very much based in Latin and South America. And the foreign exchange, the currency fluctuations there are what impacted that.\nRobert Iger: On the Shanghai side, we've seen some attendance softness this year. We're still running a profitable business, and we're still investing to grow it. But some of the issues that China has been facing, a slowdown in - or a decrease in consumer confidence, which has resulted in fewer Chinese people traveling within China, has had an impact on our business. That has made it less profitable than we hoped it would be at this point. But still a very successful business and one that we believe in long term.\nTim Nollen: Okay.\nRobert Iger: Tim, thanks. Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDan Salmon: Good afternoon, guys. I'll try to stay away from streaming as well and leave that for April, so just two questions. Bob, you noted in your comments about the National Geographic family of business is contributing to Disney+ as one of the Fox businesses coming in. Could you maybe give us an update on how you foresee the FX brand working within the Disney portfolio of businesses? And then second, you've made a lot of change on the ad sales front lately, integrating across the ABC and ESPN side and moving the addressable into the direct to consumer business. I'm just curious to get an update on how those integration efforts are going. And just to clarify, the addressable, even though it may be reported separately in a different segment, doesn't necessarily always mean it's being sold separately. I'd just love to go a layer deeper on that as well. Thank you\nRobert Iger: We, like audiences in the United States and other places are extremely impressed with FX and what it has managed to do in terms of its programming and its relationships with the creative community. And we intend to fully leverage that in both the traditional side of the FX business, but also in our new businesses. And we foresee FX developing and producing product for the Hulu platform, in particular, probably not the Disney platform because, as we talked earlier to Doug Mitchelson's question, it's not the kind of programming you typically see in a family environment. But there's ample opportunity for FX to produce more programming and to leverage its relationships in the creative community and its ability to manage creativity specifically for Hulu as we expand Hulu. On the ad sales front, there's been a significant amount of change. You talked about it. In fact, just last month, there was basically a company-wide ad sales executive retreat in which all of the ad sales executives gathered in one place with Kevin Mayer, who those people are reporting to in our new structure. I'd say we're just at the beginning of not only an integration but looking at this business differently, particularly since there's been a lot of disruption in the way that advertising is being created and the way that advertising is being spent. And we want to make sure that our organization reflects all of that change. I think it's just too early to be more specific than that. The - you asked the question about addressables. We kept that revenue under the direct-to-consumer businesses just so that we could be a little bit more transparent about what the bottom line of those businesses are as we invest in and grow those businesses. So we wanted to put the revenue - the advertising revenue that came directly from consumption on the new platforms, that's really ESPN.com primarily because there's little advertising on the ESPN+, but we just wanted to be more discreet about how that was reported.\nChristine McCarthy: The one other thing Dan, that I would add on that is that, as we have combined the ad sales force into a unified entity, that the same team is selling both addressable and linear, and so it's much better coordinated. And it's early days, but we're optimistic about how it will perform.\nDan Salmon: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Dan, thank you. And thanks again everyone for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nLowell Singer: Good afternoon, and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago, and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and a transcript of this call will be available on our website. We realize many of you are joining us today from your homes and we are also hosting today's call remotely. So joining me from their homes are Bob Chapek, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we will of course be happy to take some questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nBob Chapek: Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. As we close out the fourth quarter and reflect back on the year, I think we'd all agree it\u2019s been a year unlike any other in our lifetimes, and certainly in the history of The Walt Disney Company. Despite the many challenges and hardships, I\u2019m proud to say we have been steadfast in effectively managing our businesses under enormously difficult circumstances. We haven\u2019t just persevered during these tough times. We've also taken a number of deliberate steps and smart risks that have positioned our Company for greater long-term growth. And the impressive resilience Disney has demonstrated, while looking past today's challenges to set the stage for an even brighter future is direct reflection of our outstanding team. They've done and continue to do an admirable job, balancing the needs of our cast, our shareholders and our guests. Of course, the real bright spot amidst the pandemic has been our direct-to-consumer business. One year ago today, we launched Disney+, and it has quickly exceeded our highest expectations. We have since rolled out the services in more than 20 countries worldwide. And on Tuesday, we will launch in Latin America, including Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Argentina followed by more overseas markets in the coming year. The response from consumers has been overwhelmingly positive. Everywhere that we\u2019ve launched Disney+, audiences have embraced the wide array of high quality entertainment both original and library content. And I\u2019m pleased to report that as of the end of the fourth quarter, Disney+ had more than 73 million paid subscribers, far surpassing our expectations in just its first year, and we\u2019re continuing to see positive trends. During our Investor Day presentation on December 10, we will provide an update of our global subscriber numbers. The growth of Disney+ speaks volumes about the strength of our IP, our unparalleled brands and franchises and our amazing content creators, all part of the Disney difference that sets us apart from everyone else. And when you look across our full suite of streaming service, we have exceeded 120 million paid subscriptions worldwide with impressive subscriber gains for ESPN+ and Hulu, including the rapidly growing Hulu +Live TV. We expect the international launch of our Star-branded general entertainment offering will enable us to grow our business even further in the years ahead. Given that our DTC business is key to the future growth of our company, we've restructured our media and entertainment businesses. By separating content creation from distribution, we've been able to streamline our processes and better align the organization, towards these important strategic objectives, as we accelerate our pivot to a DTC-first business model. We intend to build upon the success we've achieved thus far. And look forward to sharing more of our plans with you, at our upcoming Investor Day. While the pandemic continues to impact our company, resulting in an adjusted loss of $0.20 a share in the fourth quarter, the prolonged situation has prompted us to find new and innovative ways to deal with the difficult and often unpredictable challenges we're facing. We successfully made adjustments and have resumed many of our operations, clearly demonstrating the resiliency The Walt Disney Company is known for. While many of our productions were shut down beginning in March due to COVID, our animation teams were able to work remotely and have continued production uninterrupted during the pandemic. We were also fortunate to keep other parts of our creative pipeline active, and to continue post-production work for our Media Networks studios and Disney+. We've been able to develop processes and institute health and safety measures that have made it possible to resume live-action production as well. Of course, the unpredictability of COVID may result in unforeseen impacts to current and future productions. On the studio side, we have restarted or completed production, on all of the projects previously impacted by COVID, including ones from our Marvel Studios, 20th Century Studios, Searchlight Pictures, Disney Live-Action and Lucasfilm. And we anticipate having eight new projects up and running, by January. On TV side, we now have more than 100 live-action, scripted and unscripted projects in active production with dozens more in various stages of pre or post production. Across all platforms, there has been a great response to our content. A couple of weeks ago, we rolled out the highly anticipated second season of The Mandalorian to rave reviews and incredible social buzz. There's been much excitement surrounding the announcement that Disney Pixar's Soul will be debuting on Disney+ on Christmas Day. And on the broadcasting side, ABC is now ranked number one, delivering some of the most popular and most watched shows on television, including Dancing with the Stars and The Conners. I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge our incredible, local and national ABC News teams for the outstanding work they continue to do, under very difficult circumstances.  They've been working around the clock, making sure viewers nationwide have access to the most important and accurate information, particularly as it pertains to the COVID pandemic. And they've also done an outstanding job reporting on the election, in an informative and balanced way. From Good Morning America holding its spot as the number one morning news cast, for the eighth straight year to World News Tonight with David Muir, consistently ranking as the number one evening newscast as well as the number one program on all broadcast and cable television in the U.S. over the summer, there is no question ABC News is America's number one news source. On the park side, we've proven over many months that we're able to operate our parks responsibly, following strictly enforced guidelines provided by health care experts, successfully reopening our parks in Orlando, Shanghai, Tokyo and Hong Kong. We've also reopened Disneyland Paris for several months, although the resort is now temporarily closed due to President Macron's recent lockdown order in response to a resurgence in COVID cases in Europe. People have shown a willingness to visit our parks, which I believe is a testament to the fact that they feel confident in the measures we've taken. And we are very encouraged by the positive news earlier this week on the progress of potential vaccines. Unfortunately, we are extremely disappointed that the State of California continues to keep Disneyland closed despite our proven track record. Our health and safety protocols are all science-based and have the support of labor unions representing 99% of our hourly cast members. Frankly as we and other civic leaders have stated before, we believe state leadership should look objectively at what we've achieved successfully at our parks around the world all based on science as opposed to setting an arbitrary standard that is precluding our cast members from getting back to work while decimating small businesses in the local community. Our ability to operate responsibly in this pandemic environment extends beyond our theme parks. I'm proud to say that we were successfully able to host the NBA and MLS at Walt Disney World in Orlando. It's been a huge undertaking and a great achievement. Just consider the NBA for example: 94 days, 22 teams, 172 games, players, broadcast partners, referees, media, support staff and Disney employees all in the bubble. It was also a big win for ESPN, which broadcast the games along with a packed schedule of other sports offerings including the WNBA, college football, Major League Baseball and the NFL. As you look at the most watched cable shows on TV this year more than half have been live sports proving that sports are a powerful draw despite the disruption of the pandemic. ESPN Digital and ESPN+ have also performed exceptionally well with September being the best month ever for ESPN streaming video. ESPN+ continues its positive subscriber growth reaching more than 10 million paid subscribers as of the end of the quarter, nearly tripling in size over the past year. As you can see, even during these most uncertain times, here's The Walt Disney Company. We are finding ways to not only operate our businesses effectively, but also take the necessary bold steps for our future growth. And we are more committed than ever to investing in our businesses in particular our DTC strategy, which we see as the key driver of significant long-term value for our company. We look forward to sharing details of our plans with you at our Investor Day next month. We also can't wait for you to see the extraordinary content that's being created for our full portfolio of streaming services: Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu and Star. It's just fantastic. And with that I'll turn it over to Christine.\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability the fiscal fourth quarter's diluted earnings per share was a loss of $0.20 and our full year fiscal 2020 diluted EPS was $2.02. Our financial results continued to reflect significant impacts from COVID-19 which we estimate adversely impacted segment operating income in Q4 by $3.1 billion. Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment was again the most severely affected with an estimated adverse impact of $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter. We estimate that Media Networks operating income was negatively impacted by approximately $500 million due to COVID largely due to costs at ESPN associated with programming in the fourth quarter that was delayed from prior quarters. Another factor that affected our Q4 results was the 53rd week. While last quarter we guided to the 53rd week having a modest adverse impact on operating results. The additional week of operations actually resulted in a benefit. There were a few reasons behind this variance, but the largest driver was related to the timing of sports rights costs. I'll now turn to our results by segment. At Parks, Experiences and Products financial results in the quarter were significantly impacted by restricted capacity and closures. Operating income at Parks, Experiences and Products declined significantly versus the prior year to an operating loss of $1.1 billion. This reflects the closures of Disneyland Resort in California and our cruise line business for the entirety of the quarter. Shanghai Disney Resort was open for the full quarter after reopening in May, while Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Paris reopened in mid-July. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was opened for a couple of weeks at the beginning and end of the quarter. All of our reopened parks and resorts were operating at significantly reduced capacities during Q4. However, we are pleased to report that Walt Disney World, Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland all achieved a net positive contribution in the quarter which means, we generated revenue that exceeded the variable costs associated with reopening. At Walt Disney World we are also encouraged by the booking trends we are seeing. Park reservations at our reduced capacity limits are already 77% booked for Q1 with Thanksgiving week booked close to capacity. These trends provide us with further confidence around underlying consumer demand for our parks and experiences. At Studio Entertainment operating income decreased in the quarter due to lower theatrical distribution and home entertainment results. Worldwide theatrical results continued to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 as theaters were closed in many key markets both domestically and internationally. With no significant worldwide theatrical releases in the quarter, we faced a difficult comparison against the strong performance of the Lion King and Toy Story 4 in the prior year quarter. The decrease was partially offset by lower marketing expenses. Lower home entertainment results were driven by lower unit sales, also partially offset by lower marketing expenses. Unit sales were lower in the quarter as there were no comparable releases versus the prior year performance of Avengers: Endgame, Aladdin and Captain Marvel. Turning to Media Networks. Operating income was up in the fourth quarter due to higher results at broadcasting, partially offset by lower results at cable networks. At broadcasting, the increase in operating income was primarily due to affiliate revenue growth and lower programming production and marketing costs. The decrease in programming and production costs was largely driven by COVID-19-related production shutdowns and cancellations of network programming, the shift of college football games to fiscal 2021 and a delay in airing new season premieres. Lower results at Cable Networks were driven by decreases at ESPN, partially offset by increases at FX networks and the domestic Disney channels. ESPN results were lower as affiliate and advertising revenue growth were more than offset by higher programming and production costs. At ESPN, higher programming and production costs were largely due to COVID-related shifts of rights costs for the NBA and Major League Baseball into the fourth quarter. This included two NBA finals games and 16 MLB postseason games that fell into the 53rd week. Total ESPN advertising revenue was up 26% in the fourth quarter including the benefit of the 53rd week. The return of live sports events drove higher rates slightly offset by viewership declines. So far this quarter, ESPN domestic linear cash ad sales are pacing below the prior year, primarily due to shifts in college football schedules, particularly for the Big Ten and the Pac-12. Given the timing of programming remaining in the quarter, we currently expect that ESPN advertising revenue will end the first quarter higher versus the prior year. Total Media Networks affiliate revenue increased 12% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of eight points from the 53rd week and eight points of growth from higher rates offset by a four-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. The decrease in subscribers benefited by about two points from the launch of the ACC Network. At Direct-to-Consumer & International, an operating loss of $580 million in the quarter was an improvement of approximately $170 million compared to the prior year. This improvement was driven by higher results at Hulu and ESPN+, partially offset by costs associated with the ongoing rollout of Disney+ and a decrease at our international channels. At Hulu, the improvement was primarily due to both subscriber and advertising revenue growth, partially offset by higher programming and production costs. The improvement at ESPN+ was due to subscriber growth as well as increased pay-per-view income from UFC events. Hulu ended the fourth quarter with 36.6 million paid subscribers and ESPN+ ended the quarter with 10.3 million paid subscribers. Disney+ ended Q4 with 73.7 million paid subscribers or an increase of over 16 million subscribers versus Q3. Disney+ Hotstar subscriber additions were the largest contributor to this increase, driven by the start of the delayed IPL season. Disney+ Hotstar subscribers now account for a little over a quarter of our global subscriber base. Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $4.52. However, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $5.30. On our last earnings call, we said that we expected the fourth quarter operating results of our DTC businesses to improve by approximately $100 million relative to the prior year quarter. Our results came in better than that guidance, with operating income at our DTC businesses improving by approximately $300 million versus the prior year due to better than expected performance across all three of our streaming services. I will note that we do not plan to further update any of our subscriber numbers until our Investor Day on December 10. At our international channels, lower results were due to lower affiliate and advertising revenues, partially offset by a decrease in costs. Switching gears, I want to take a moment to give you an update on our 21CF acquisition. We previously stated our expectation that the deal would be accretive to EPS, excluding the impact of purchase accounting for fiscal 2021. While COVID certainly had an impact on these numbers, we estimate the acquisition of 21CF and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu were accretive in both Q3 and Q4 of fiscal 2020, excluding the impact of purchase accounting. As a practical matter, given our recent reorganization and the successful and complete integration of these assets into The Walt Disney Company, it is no longer practical nor do we believe it would be insightful into our businesses to break down 21CF performance. Therefore, we do not intend to discuss legacy Fox results or accretion on a go-forward basis. As we've discussed on prior calls, while our liquidity position remains strong, we are continuing to manage our leverage with a long-term commitment to return to levels consistent with a single A credit rating. As part of that commitment and given limited visibility due to COVID and our decision to prioritize investment in our DTC initiatives, the Board has decided to forego payment of a semi-annual dividend in January 2021. Our capital allocation strategy will continue to prioritize investing in the growth of our businesses, particularly in the direct-to-consumer space. However, we anticipate the payment of a dividend will remain a part of our long-term capital allocation strategy following the return to a normalized operating environment. As we look forward, we expect that our results in fiscal 2021 will continue to be impacted by COVID-19. Our visibility is limited and will be influenced by a number of factors, including but not limited to, the recovery of theatrical exhibition, confidence in consumer travel and the continued resumption of live sports. But, as we sit here today, there are a few items we would like to highlight that may help frame expectations for the first quarter. Our Parks and Experiences business continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and we do not have visibility into how long these impacts will last. While some of our parks are open with limited capacity, we currently anticipate Disneyland Resort will remain closed at least through the end of the fiscal first quarter. Disneyland Paris is also currently closed. Because we have no significant tentpole theatrical releases planned for Q1, we expect that our theatrical results will be meaningfully below the prior year, during which we released Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker and Frozen 2. We also anticipate that home entertainment, stage play and studio TV SVOD results will be meaningfully lower year-over-year. Similarly at Consumer Products, we expect merchandise licensing results in Q1 to be adversely impacted due to comparisons versus Star Wars and Frozen merchandise in the prior year. At ESPN, first quarter results will be significantly impacted by higher rights and production costs due to the shift of four NBA finals games and three additional college football playoff games into quarter, along with incremental regular season college football rights costs shifting into the quarter. This impact is partially offset by an expected delayed start to the 2020-2021 NBA season. We expect the Q1 operating results of our DTC businesses to decline by approximate $100 million relative to the prior year quarter, driven by continued investment in Disney+, partially offset by improved results at both ESPN+ and Hulu. At our international channels business, we expect first quarter operating results to decline by approximately $300 million versus the prior year quarter driven by a combination of higher sports rights costs due to timing shifts COVID-related impacts and channel closures. Our capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 were approximately $4 billion, down about $850 million from the prior year due to decreased spending at our domestic parks and resorts. We expect CapEx in fiscal year 2021 to be $550 million higher versus fiscal year 2020 due to increased investments at our media and entertainment distribution businesses and at corporate, partially offset by reduced spending at Parks Experiences and Products. As we've previously noted, we will start reporting under our new organizational structure in the first fiscal quarter of 2021. While our reporting segments will change, we intend to provide key financial and supplemental information, including much of what we report today, particularly as it relates to our direct-to-consumer businesses. As always, our goal is to provide the needed transparency into our businesses. We remain very excited about our future and we also look forward to sharing more details on our evolving DTC strategy at our December 10 virtual Investor Day. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell and we would be happy to take your questions.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks Christine. And as we do transition to the Q&A, let me note that since we are not physically together this afternoon, I will do my best to moderate this by directing your questions to the appropriate executive. And with that, operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: Of course. Our first question will come from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. Lowell I have two for you to shepherd. The first is on ESPN. You'd announced some cost cuts, but I wondered, if the company is taking a fresh look at their content rights needs? And if there's any kind of update on the willingness to maybe cut back on some of the rights you've had previously? How do you think about that? And then secondly, for whomever you want to send it to, over the years Disney made a pretty smart decision to cut back the number of films they release every year, to focus on quality and franchises. And I just wonder now with the reorganization and the new game plan at DTC, how will kind of the quality of the franchises and the content output be managed, as it's increased, right? So it looks like it's a change in terms of the output of the organization. Just want to hear about the quality management of that. Thanks Lowell.\nLowell Singer: Okay Michael. Thanks. I'm going to turn both of those over to Bob.\nBob Chapek: All right. Thank you, Lowell. Hi, Michael.\nMichael Nathanson: Hi, Bob.\nBob Chapek: In terms of ESPN and the cost cuts, we are obviously watching our costs across all of our operating units very carefully, in light of the adversity that we're facing with the pandemic. But long-term, as we look at our content rights, well we're looking at it from a shareholder standpoint. If it's accretive to shareholder value, then there are decisions that we make going forward in terms of looking at new rights, as they expire. And what we want to put on to our service. So we're being very deliberate and we're being very careful. And analyzing everything to make sure that it would be something, that would be additive to us. And I might say that, we've got very good relationships with all the leagues. And it's important. We continue to believe in sports. As a matter of fact in 2019, 93 of the top 100 programs in viewership on television were sports. And as you know, we've got the most trusted brand out there in the world, in terms of sports. So we believe that's a nice recipe for future success. But we realize that the world is changing. And there's a lot of dynamics at play. But we'll only do continue rights deals as long as they add shareholder value. In terms of the second question and in terms of the looking at the number of films and the amount of content that we put into the system, you're right. Over time we've been very, very discriminate, in terms of what types of films we make and how many we make. And I think that's really benefited the company. We're in a world though now in a subscription business, where we're managing churn. And we've got a unique combination of assets in this company that are all at play right now in Disney+, where we've not only got the most desirable library in the world, but we realize and that really helps by the way minimize churn. But we also realize that new content that we put add subscribers. It's very clear to us, that new content adds subscribers. So I think you'll see a continued increase in investment, in our direct-to-consumer platforms. And that will then fuel, some of the growth that Christine will talk about at the investor conference, that we expect on December 10.\nLowell Singer: Michael? Thanks for the -- okay. Thanks Michael for the questions. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani: Hi. Thank you. Just a bit of a follow-up question, if I may, on the studio content commentary, I would love any color you could give potentially on, what you learned from the release of Mulan into premium video-on-demand? And really how you think about, at least how you've thought about it in the past, your decision to allocate content on different platforms for example, why Mulan goes to AOP VOD, but Soul is going directly to Disney+ for example so any thoughts there? And then my second -- just a follow-up question is really on the parks. You've made some real improvement in cutting your losses this quarter from the last quarter. I guess is it feasible to assume you can continue to see a further improvement in that segment without Disneyland opening? Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Alexia thanks so much. So Bob, I'll turn them both over to you Mulan and Soul and then some of the trends we're seeing at parks. \nBob Chapek: Okay. Great. So from a studio content standpoint, we were very pleased with the results of Mulan as a premier access title. And as you remember that was our very first foray into a strategy like premier access. Unfortunately that title met with some controversy both in the U.S. and internationally shortly after we released it. But we saw enough very positive results before that controversy started to know that we've got something here in terms of the premier access strategy. And I think we'll talk a little bit more about that at the investor conference in December. In terms of Soul, we also realized though that part of the lifeblood of Disney+ is providing great content to the base level subscribers that are in there in premier or in Disney+. And so the idea is that, we thought it was a really nice gesture to our subscribers to take Soul during the holiday period and provide that as part of the service. But I think what we've learned with Mulan is that there's going to be a role for it strategically with our portfolio of offerings. And again we're going to talk more about that at the investor conference in December. In terms of our opportunities to continue to improve parks, we're actually very encouraged by what we're seeing right now in our parks across the world. There's really two dynamics that are going on. Number one, our park operators which as you know are the best in the world are becoming much more efficient and effective in operating under COVID guidelines. And we've been able to pretty materially increase our capacity and still stay within the guidelines that local governments are giving us for example 6-foot social distancing. And this is happening across our parks across the world. In fact Walt Disney World which was at a 25% capacity constraint which was our industrial engineering estimates to keep 6-foot social distancing now has been able to increase to 35% of capacity. So almost a 50% increase in the number of guests that we can allow in and still adhere to the local guidelines and the guidelines that are stipulated by the CDC with the 6-foot social distancing. So we're very pleased by how we've become adept at operating under these constraints. But the second thing that's even more encouraging is the demanding -- demand that's growing for our parks across the world. I think it says two different things. Number one shows the love that guests have for our experiences that we have within our parks and the tremendous IP that we as a company have. But I also think it speaks to the trust that people have given the track record that we now have after months of operating across the globe with very stringent guidelines. And we're very pleased with our track record. And I think people are now through forward bookings and reservations showing some very encouraging signs about their willingness to come and spend time with us at a Disney park. \nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Alexia, thank you. Operator, next please?\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks, good afternoon. Christine I know you're not going to be providing the accretion dilution analysis going forward and I certainly get a lot of moving pieces. But I'm just wondering, if you could tell us whether there are additional costs that you expect to come out of the business? I think you guys had talked about over $2 billion of synergies. I'm just wondering if we look at 2021 versus '20, if there's still more to go as you work through the integration etcetera? And then probably for Bob. Bob, I know you're saving a lot for December 10, but you announced a pretty substantial reorganization of the company in a year that's obviously already had a lot of disruption, particularly around the Direct-to-Consumer business with Kevin leaving et cetera. I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your motivation there kind of the reaction you've gotten from your senior executives. Many have had their roles shifted pretty substantially including giving up kind of P&L accountability. Just wonder if you could talk about your confidence that you -- you're going to get what you want out of this from a company perspective and that you can manage the risk of separating content production decisions from monetization decisions because it's a pretty substantial change? Thank you.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay, Hi, Ben.\nBen Swinburne: Hello.\nChristine McCarthy: It's Christine. Let me take your first question which was on the cost savings that we achieved from the integration of 21CF. And we did meet -- actually we exceeded that $2 billion number. And so we feel really good about the momentum we have on the efficiency side. And we're also going to take the opportunity to continue looking for operational efficiencies. The one thing we've learned in this COVID environment is there are ways of being more efficient and we'll continue to mine those. And it actually has really helped us not only in segments like our parks business that are directly impacted, but throughout the entire company. So we'll continue to drive towards greater efficiencies. And when the -- you asked about how much do we incur in the restructuring charges related to Fox. Overall, Fox restructuring charges were $1.7 billion. And $1.2 billion of that was incurred in fiscal 2019 so $500 million was done this year. And in this quarter where we had about a little under $400 million of restructuring charges a portion of that was also Fox related. It comes out to about a little over -- a little less than 30%. So the balance was related to our cuts at \u2013 reductions-in-force at Parks. \nBenjamin Swinburne: Got it. \nBob Chapek: And in terms of the question on the reorganization, I would suggest that maybe given everything that's happening in the world this is the perfect time for us to do such a reorganization. And I'm 100% confident that this is going to play out exactly as we had intended. It's going extremely well. And despite the disruption in everyone's roles, I think we have 100% buy in. I think we have 100% buy in because we have clarity on accountability which everyone really likes. And we separate out roles to what people tend to do best. Content does what they do best and same with distribution. So distribution who manages the P&L will set the parameters for our annual and long-term budget framework that's been agreed to on the slate with the content creators. And then the content creators then green light the individual projects that then shepherd development and production. So essentially distribution is now able to optimize the commercialization without maybe too much unnecessary regard for legacy distribution platforms, but at the same time our creatives who as you know are the best in the world are really free to do what they do. And that's just make the best content and storytelling possible. A lot of collaboration between the two groups, but ultimately some level of independence in terms of each being what they can be and doing their jobs best. \nBenjamin Swinburne: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Ben, thank you. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Lowell, thank you. I have two questions as well. Could you comment on the change of management at Star? Does that affect your strategy in India or outside with the rollout of the Star-branded service? And then secondly, sorry to be negative, but the sports viewing decline -- I mean there's just so much going on and I wonder if you could give us your thoughts like there were no fans in the stadium so would change the viewing experience. The calendar has changed. There's a lot of sports in a short period of time. Do you have any concerns about how this will impact consumer behavior post-COVID? I'd love your thoughts on kind of the longer-term outlook for sports?\nLowell Singer: Okay, Jessica. Thanks. I am going to turn both of those questions over to Bob.\nBob Chapek: Okay. I'm going to take the last one first. In terms of sports ratings, sports ratings we feel that in context of everything that's happening are actually holding up quite well. But we would be careful not to draw any conclusions about the ultimate health of sports sort of the long-term impact that you suggested during this pandemic. We really think that we're sort of looking at apples and oranges here. I think the best comp we probably have is the NFL, which has been relatively flat. Our Monday night football viewership has been down 4% relatively modest despite all the headwinds. I mean, we've got the risk of seasons not finishing. To your point, we don't have fans in the stands. We have the risk of games individually every week being canceled. We have election news as competition. And we really can't have our fans doing what they like to do the best which is watch in a communal setting. They pretty much are watching by themselves. Despite all those headwinds, the fact that our Monday night football business is relatively flat in terms of viewership is really I think really encouraging. And if you adjust if you will viewership over the last couple of months for the amount of available content, you see that they kind of slide together. So we actually don't have any concerns about the long-term health of sports. Obviously, we've got some headwinds as it pertains to short-term challenges and hurdles. But we think that all in all in context, the health of sports is pretty decent given everything that's going on. In terms of India, obviously we have an executive there Uday Shankar who we love and we wish him well. He gave us some indication several months ago that he was thinking of moving on. We've got a really deep bench there. And we feel that we have all kinds of opportunities and a lot of success so far with Disney+. And we have no reason to believe that that success won't continue and even accelerate going forward.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Jessica, thank you. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. Lowell, I got two quick ones and then a main question. The quick ones are the math on India, I think if I have it right based on Christine's comment around $5.30 you're around 11 million subs, which would be about 2.5 million added in the quarter. I just wanted to make sure that was in the ballpark and I was looking for an update on the cruise ships that were on order. But the main question is having re-upped some Disney+ distribution deals, what changes are you seeing now, now that you are of the uncertain phase and the value on both sides is better defined for you and for the distributor, does the economics of those deals change? Or should we think about the cost of that marketing channel as locked in? And I also ask because as you add more and more original content to your streaming services I would think the benefit starts to shift in favor the distributors as you add more and more value to those services. So that would be helpful. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Okay. So I'll let Christine sort of quickly address your India question and then I'll turn over the cruise and the Disney+ questions to Bob.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. Hi, Doug, we're not \u2013 the comments that I gave on the Hotstar Disney+ India subs, we just don't comment on those economics. So unfortunately, we can't give you any more detail on that.\nBob Chapek: And in terms of cruise ships, as you know, we just got new guidelines from the CDC that are quite thorough let's say. And they really entail some really high hurdles in terms of not only testing by the potential guests that we host on the ships, but also a process that has to happen in order to certify our first sailings. Those will necessarily result in delays beyond what we had hoped in terms of getting our ships back in service and making magic for our guests. I guess, the best news out of all of it is that, we now do see some light at the end of the tunnel. I think we have an opportunity to create sort of a Disney bubble, if you want \u2013 if you would on each one of our cruise ships. And demand is very, very strong for our cruise ships. We're seeing extremely strong demand in the back half of FY 2021, and all of 2022 in terms of \u2013 of bookings. That said, that then creates the demand for the new ships that you asked about. And right now we're anticipating delivering our first new ship The Wish in summer of 2022. And then we have our next two ships in 2024 and 2025. And so after a slight delay of roughly six months on those ships, we think that we're going to be able to bring them on to service. We hope and expect that the world will back to normal by then, and anticipate having a fine time trying to fill up the demand of those ships. And we think there's going to be so much pent-up demand that, we don't expect to have much issues given the love that our guests have for Disney Cruise Lines. In terms of the distribution deals and sort of the changing the landscape over time with those, we're really pleased with our partnerships to date. We try to limit them. We don't do too many, but we use them to strategically pursue growth of our subscriber base and lower subscriber acquisition costs. So as you know, we have one or two of these in each market. That's about it. But it really does help us sort of provide a base during our growth phase, and we've got full flexibility over time to either ramp those up, or ramp those down as we see fit.\nDoug Mitchelson: Great. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Thanks Doug. Operator next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.\nJason Bazinet: Just a question for Mr. Chapek. Can I go back to the re-org that you announced? The more content it seems that you put on the DTC side, the lower your earnings will be but the better the sub growth will be and the higher the stock price will be. And so as those decisions are being made today and next year and the year after, are there guardrails in place that sort of mean, this will be a gradual transition? Or is it really whatever the right business decision, is the right business decision, and you'll do it, even if it means, maybe different near-term financials in terms of profitability than The Street is expecting? Thank you.\nBob Chapek: Yeah. I think the guardrails are good common sense as it pertains to managing cash. With our parks business sort of being \u2013 having an anchor on it, if you will that we can't properly operate our parks business like we'd like to we have to be a little bit more careful today than we might have to be in the future. But I'm just going to suggest that when we talk to everybody on December 10, I think you're going to see that we're going to put a lot of wind in the sails of our Disney+ business and heavily invest in it. And so the guardrails are just the only ones that would be the constraints that we face today in terms of cash. Other than that everything is really full speed forward. And of course we've got our linear networks that we're managing. We've made some reductions just this last week at ESPN as we manage the transition from linear to more of a digital experience and direct-to-consumer experience. And so as we toggle that balance between sort of the legacy old media businesses to the new media businesses, we'll do it aggressively, but we will watch it from a cash standpoint in the meantime.\nJason Bazinet: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nLowell Singer : Jason, thank you. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Hey, thanks. Maybe just a quick couple of few follow-up to Jason's questions. Bob in terms of the cash you got $18 billion on the books. I guess, can we expect a significant, like you said a significant ramp in the content spend? And can we assume as a result of that that the progress you guys have made in terms of DTC losses, doesn't mean that those losses have peaked at this point? And then can you talk a little bit about content spend as it relates to entertainment program going into Disney+ and Hulu and Star and ESPN+? ESPN+ obviously has been a -- there's some nice growth there getting up to 10 million subs. Do you expect to shift more of your portfolio from or simulcasted from linear to the DTC platform? Or should we expect some investments in new rights? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: Okay. John, thanks for the question. I'm going to let Christine take the first question around cash and then Bob talk a little bit more about program investment.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, John. It's Christine. You're right that our cash and cash equivalents are a very healthy $18 billion. That's down from $23 billion in the prior quarter. Just to put some context around the reduction we lowered our commercial paper balances by almost $5 billion. And we also had some bond maturities over $1 billion that we took care of. But we are still generating operating cash and we are investing in our content now. We're spending a lot of our productions are back up and running. So we're going to manage this. But as we ramp up even more additional new productions we will be spending more cash on that, but we'll follow this up. And when the peak of investment is anticipated we will update you with that information on December 10. \nBob Chapek: And my answers are going to be relatively the same in terms of the programming between our linear and our DTC business. First of all, Christine will talk about sort of the guidance at the investor conference specifically in terms of we have our losses peaked, which was your direct question and will update though. Additionally, we will be investing heavily. We'll talk again about -- more about this at the investor conference, but we are going to continue to ramp up our investment in DTC. And we will be heavily tilting the scale from linear networks over to our DTC business, as we see that as we said in our opening comments our primary catalyst for growth as a company. So, again, we're going to talk a lot more about this on December 10, but you will see a heavy tilt.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: John, thanks for the question. Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: And our final question today will come from Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nMichael Morris: Thank you. Good afternoon. Two for me. First, can you talk about the ad revenue per Hulu subscriber decline in the quarter that you referenced in the release? Just given the strength that we're seeing in the sort of connected TV marketplace, I was kind of surprised to see that. So I'm curious your take on how that business is going, and how we should think about that. My second question is really a follow-up to one of the early ones around sports and sports content. And I'm curious how you think about expanding sports content availability to consumers that don't have a pay TV package. I think at this point there's 30 million or 35 million households in the U.S. Bob, you just referenced some of the stability in ratings. So maybe that would imply that people who want sports still pay TV, and so it's not an issue. But I'm curious, if the leagues have any increasing urgency to sort of reach those, those cord cutters or cord nevers and maybe what some of the considerations are for you whether it's financial impact or whether it's rights limitations or things like that? Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Okay, Mike. So I'm going to let Bob take the sports question, and then we'll go to Christine on the Hulu question.\nBob Chapek: Okay. In terms of the -- sort of the cord cutters and solutions for the cord cutters, I won't speak to what the leagues' thoughts are. I'll leave that up to them. But I will tell you that we've got a product that we're really excited about and has experienced some rapid growth and that's Hulu + Live TV. And it really gives the utility that consumers might normally find from the cable or satellite subscriber and be able to get it over-the-top directly to their homes. And I think this will increasingly act as a solution to those households that have walked away from their traditional, more traditional cable type of subscriptions and potentially slide it + Live TV. And that's one of the reasons why we're really bullish about that business. I'm a personal big fan of it. I use it. And it's really slick. It's very elegant, and it really is a big solution provider. It's really the complete solution, I think. So we're excited about that in terms of solving a consumer need for those consumers as you mentioned that have all walked away from that particular way of distributing and receiving content.\nChristine McCarthy: Mike and on Hulu, overall, I would say that we're seeing very, very strong demand for advertising on Hulu in the addressable market. But the year-over-year comparisons were negatively impacted on a per sub basis by what we're seeing in the advertising market overall in Q3 and Q4. But we're going to talk more about Hulu advertising in more detail at the Investor Day. So, just hold on until December 10, and hopefully we can answer all your questions then.\nMichael Morris: Great, thank you.\nLowell Singer: Okay, Mike. Thank you, and thanks again everyone for joining us today. As Bob and Christine have mentioned we are looking forward to sharing a lot more with you at our December 10 Investor Day, and we look forward to seeing a lot of you then.

So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob Chapek to get started.\nBob Chapek: Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone, I hope you're all doing well and staying safe. These continue to be challenging times for our world. The impact of the pandemic on people's lives, our communities, businesses and way of life has been devastating, and we remain deeply appreciative of the healthcare workers, researchers, community leaders and everyone doing their part to get us through this difficult period. Along with the challenges posed by the pandemic, the issues of racism and social injustice have also been front and center in ours and the nation's consciousness in recent months. We have been working closely with our employees and cast members in this critical area and have established six new strategic pillars to achieve greater diversity and inclusion across the company. We are committed to strongly advancing these initiatives as we strive towards greater representation and inclusion both in our workforce and creative content. As you know, the majority of businesses worldwide have experienced unprecedented disruption as a result of the pandemic. Most of our businesses were shut down and this had a huge impact on our third quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.08 a share compared to $1.34 a share last year. Christine will talk more in depth about our results for the quarter. Despite the harsh realities we are facing today, we have made some encouraging progress. Since our last earnings call, we've begun a responsible phased reopening of our parks in Shanghai, Paris, Tokyo, and Orlando, as well as our shopping and dining area Downtown Disney in Anaheim. We have prioritized the health and safety of our cast members and guests and have instituted protocols that include a mandatory mask policy, temperature screenings, increased cleaning and disinfecting, as well as capacity restrictions to promote social distancing. We continue to work with national and local health and government officials in this very fluid situation and are making adjustments as necessary. Along with millions of fans, we're also pleased with the return of major live sports on ESPN including the successful resumption of the NBA and MLS seasons within the Walt Disney World bubble and restarts of the WNBA and MLB. Another positive development to note has been the initial restarting of some of our television and film productions, both domestically and overseas. When I became CEO in February, I emphasized that we will continue to pursue bold innovation thoughtful risk taking and the creative storytelling, that is the lifeblood of the Walt Disney Company, and despite the challenges of the pandemic, we've managed to take deliberate and innovative steps in running our businesses. At the same time, we've also been very focused on advancing and growing our direct-to-consumer business, which we see as our top priority and key to the future of our company. Last November, we successfully launched Disney+ domestically and we've since rolled it out in a number of major international markets, including Western Europe, India and Japan. I am also incredibly pleased to announce that, as of yesterday, we have surpassed 60.5 million paid subscribers globally, far exceeding our initial projections for the service. As our global sub numbers continue to grow, we've also exceeded our internal subscriber projections in every major market we've launched thus far. The tremendous success of Disney+ in less than a year clearly establishes us as a major force in the global direct-to-consumer space. We will continue our international expansion with the launch of Disney+ in the Nordics, Belgium, Luxembourg and Portugal in September, and in Latin America this November. And I'm happy to announce that we will also be rolling out Disney+ Hotstar on September 5 in Indonesia, one of the world's most populous countries. By year-end, Disney+ will be available in nine of the top 10 economies in the world. When you look across our full portfolio of direct-to-consumer businesses, at Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, our combined global reach now exceeds an astounding 100 million paid subscriptions. This is a significant milestone and a reaffirmation of our strategy for growth. In fact, the incredible success we've achieved to date has made us even more confident about the future of our direct-to-consumer business and our ability to be more aggressive in our approach. Going forward, this confidence, coupled with the trends we're seeing in the multi-channel universe, will lead us to pursue even more innovative and bold initiatives as we continue to grow the business. I'd like to take this opportunity to share with you some of our upcoming plans and then we'll provide you more details at an investor presentation that we will host in the upcoming months. We've already demonstrated an aggressive approach to our content creation pipeline accelerating the Disney+ debuts of Frozen 2, Pixar's Onward and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, fast-tracking the debut of Broadway's Hamilton to Disney+, which has been a huge success. By combining the best elements of live theater, film and streaming, we have given millions of viewers a whole new way to experience this iconic cultural phenomenon. And last week, Beyonce's visual album, Black is King, premiered on Disney+, had critical acclaim, it's being widely celebrated for its diverse cast, stunning artistry and inspiring interpretation of the black experience. Both Hamilton and Black is King have clearly shown the power of the Disney+ platform for premiering world-class content. And there's more great content coming to the service. Highlights include Disney live actions, The One and Only Ivan, which will stream exclusively on the service beginning August 21 and the right stuff from National Geographic about NASA's Project Mercury which is set to premiere this fall. And millions of fans are anxiously awaiting the highly anticipated second season of The Mandalorian in October. The blockbuster series was just honored last week with an incredible 15 Emmy nominations including Outstanding Drama Series, a first for a debut streaming service. It also bears noting that the Walt Disney Company's television, cable, studio productions and streaming entities received an impressive 145 Primetime Emmy nominations, 92 were for programming content produced by our entities, which really speaks to the power of our creative engines across the company. As I said earlier, we've been able to begin resuming some of our creative pipeline activities amidst the pandemic and we're confident that when we can fully resume operations, we will be able to do so in a meaningful way with some of the best creative teams and most popular franchises in the industry. Like many companies, we've had to find innovative ways to conduct our business during the pandemic. While we view this as a devastating situation for everyone affected, it's also forced us to consider different approaches and look for new opportunities. In the process, we're discovering ways to better serve our consumers during this challenging period. Unfortunately, we've had to delay the release of Disney's highly anticipated tentpole film Mulan a number of times due to the impact of COVID on theaters. In order to meet the needs of consumers during this unpredictable period, we thought it was important to find alternative ways to bring this exceptional family-friendly film to them in a timely manner. We are announcing today that in most Disney+ markets including the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and a number of countries in Western Europe, we will be offering Disney+ subscribers the epic adventure Mulan on Disney+ on a premier access basis beginning September 4. The price point will be $29.99 in the U.S. and will vary slightly in other countries. Simultaneously, we will be releasing the film theatrically in certain markets where currently we have no announced launch plans for Disney+ and where theaters are open. We see this as an opportunity to bring this incredible film to a broad audience currently unable to go to movie theaters, while also further enhancing the value and attractiveness of a Disney+ subscription with this great content. Given the rapid changes in consumer behavior, we believe it is more important than ever that we continue to grow our direct relationship with our customers, and to this end, I am also pleased to announce that we plan to launch an international direct-to-consumer general entertainment offering under the Star brand in calendar year 2021. Mirroring the strategy we successfully pursued with Disney+, the offering will be rooted in content we own from the prolific and critically acclaimed production engines and libraries of ABC Studios, Fox Television, FX, Freeform, 20th Century Studios and Searchlight. In many markets, the offering will be fully integrated into our established Disney+ platform from both a marketing and a technology perspective, and it will be distributed under the Star brand which has been successfully utilized by the company for other general entertainment platform launches, particularly with Disney+ Hotstar in India. The fact that Disney+ is growing as rapidly as it has both domestically and globally, clearly demonstrates the value of our content, and through the addition of our Star-branded general entertainment offering, we were further extending the value of that content internationally. Let me reiterate that we see tremendous opportunity in the direct-to-consumer space, and in the light of the success that we've achieved thus far with our global direct-to-consumer business and bolstered by our ability to deliver the exceptional brands, franchises and storytelling their consumers around the world have demonstrated a tremendous affinity for, we intend to take full advantage of that opportunity. To this end, as I mentioned, we will be hosting another Investor Day in the coming months, focused on our plans to accelerate the push into the direct-to-consumer marketplace across our Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ and Star brands. Personally, I am as optimistic as I could be about our way forward and I'm excited to share more about our plans with you in the coming months. With that, I'll turn it over to Christine.\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bob mentioned, our financial results in the fiscal third quarter were significantly impacted by COVID-19. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, this quarter's diluted earnings per share were $0.08. I'll note this is the first quarter where results in both the current and prior-year period reflect a full quarter of operations from the 21CF assets we acquired. We estimate the adverse impact of COVID-19-related disruption on our third quarter segment operating income was approximately $3 billion net of cost mitigations. Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment was the most severely affected with an adverse impact of $3.5 billion, while the puts and takes across our other businesses aggregated to a net benefit as lower revenues were generally offset by the benefit of cost deferrals and cost reductions. We expect many of these cost deferrals to reverse in future quarters due primarily to the timing shift of sporting events. As we reopen many of our businesses, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs related to addressing the safety of our cast members, talent and guests as well as various government regulations. These include but are not limited to incremental costs as it relates to responsibly resuming production of film and television content as well as the enhanced measures we have put into place at our parks and resorts. We estimate that through the end of fiscal 2021, these incremental cash costs could total approximately $1 billion. We expect many of these expenditures, particularly those related to restarting productions to be capitalized and amortized over future periods. At Parks, Experiences and Products, third quarter results largely reflect the closures of our domestic parks and resorts, cruise line business and Disneyland Paris for the entirety of the quarter. Our Shanghai and Hong Kong resorts were also closed for part of the quarter with Shanghai reopening on May 11 and Hong Kong reopening on June 18. However, Hong Kong was subsequently closed on July 15 due to a government order. As a result of these widespread disruptions, operating results at Parks, Experiences and Products declined significantly versus the prior year to an operating loss of about $2 billion. These results also reflect an adverse impact at our Consumer Products business due to the effects of COVID-19. At Walt Disney World, we are achieving our objective of driving a positive net contribution at current attendance levels and we expect demand will grow when the COVID situation in Florida improves. We are also closely monitoring trends at our reopened sites internationally, and in particular, have been pleased with what we've seen at Shanghai since reopening in May. While uncertainty still exists regarding the timing for reopening some of our businesses, we remain committed to creating high quality experiences for all of our guests and are confident in our ability to generate long-term value through these assets. At Studio Entertainment, operating income decreased in the quarter as higher TV/SVOD distribution results, lower home entertainment marketing costs and lower film impairments were more than offset by lower theatrical distribution results. Worldwide theatrical results were adversely impacted by COVID-19. Given the closure of theaters, both domestically and internationally, no significant titles were released in the quarter. This resulted in a difficult comparison against the outstanding performance of Avengers End Game in the prior-year quarter. Higher TV/SVOD results were driven by content sales to Disney+ including library titles, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Onward, partially offset by a decrease in sales to third parties in the pay window. Turning to Media Networks, operating income was up in the third quarter due to higher results at both Broadcasting and Cable. At Broadcasting, the increase in operating income was due to lower programming and production costs, an increase in affiliate revenue, higher program sales and lower marketing costs. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising revenue. The decrease in programming and production costs was largely due to production shutdowns as a result of COVID-19, partially offset by a timing impact from new accounting guidance. You may recall that while the new accounting guidance resulted in lower programming and production expenses during the first half of the fiscal year, we have said that we expect programming and production expenses to be higher in the second half of the year as capitalized costs are amortized. Higher programming sales in the quarter were driven by titles including The Simpsons, Modern Family, and The Politician. Total broadcasting ad revenue was down 17% in the quarter, driven by decreases at our owned television stations and the ABC Network. Higher results at cable networks are primarily due to increases at ESPN and FX Networks. ESPN benefited from lower programming and production costs and to a lesser extent higher affiliate revenue, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. FX Networks benefited from lower marketing and programming costs. At ESPN, lower programming and production costs were largely due to the deferral of rights costs for the NBA and Major League Baseball. We currently expect these games to be played in future quarters and the rights costs will be incurred accordingly. Total ESPN advertising revenue was down significantly in the third quarter due to the impact of COVID-19 and the absence of the NBA and other significant live sports programming. Several live sporting events have already returned to ESPN this quarter including Major League Soccer on July 8, Major League Baseball on July 23, and the NBA just last Friday. Assuming the resumption of live sports continues as planned, we expect ESPN's ad sales in Q4, including the benefit of the 53rd week, to benefit significantly, particularly from the NBA. Total Media Networks affiliate revenue increased 2%. This was driven by 7 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a four-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers which benefited by about 2 points due to the launch of the ACC network. At our direct-to-consumer and International segment, operating losses were approximately $140 million higher in the quarter compared to last year, driven by costs associated with the launch of Disney+ which expanded into several new markets during the third quarter, partially offset by improved results at Star and ESPN+. During the third quarter, we launched Disney+ in India via our Disney+ Hotstar service, in France, the strategic partnership with Canal+, and in Japan via a limited launch with NTT DOCOMO. At the end of the quarter, Disney+ had a paid subscriber base of 57.5 million, which as Bob mentioned, has now grown to 60.5 million as of August 3. Given the unique nature of our India offering, it's worth noting that Disney+ Hotstar comprised about 15% of our quarter-end subscribers. As it relates to ARPU. Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $4.62. However, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $5.31. At Star, higher results reflect lower programming costs, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. Both of these drivers reflect the absence of cricket in the third quarter including a shift in rights costs for the Indian Premier League which we expect to be recognized in future quarters and the absence of costs for the quadrennial ICC World Cup which aired in the prior-year quarter. ESPN+ operating results improved versus the prior year quarter due to subscriber growth and an increase in UFC pay-per-view income. Results at our direct-to-consumer businesses had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of about $200 million which came in better than the guidance we provided last quarter, primarily due to the better than expected results at Disney+ and Hulu. This outperformance, along with lower-than-expected expenses at our international channels, contributed to the segment's overall operating loss of approximately $700 million coming in better than our prior guidance. Note that our third quarter segment results at DTCI excluded approximately $5 billion of impairment charges related to our international channels business, which is included in our calculation of as reported earnings per share. These impairment charges reflect the underperformance of these assets due to COVID-19 as well as the impact of our accelerated push into direct-to-consumer streaming services in the midst of declines in our international MVPD subscriber base. Additional details can be found in our 10-Q, which we expect to file shortly. We expect to our direct-to-consumer and international segment to generate about $1.1 billion in operating losses for the fourth quarter. And we expect the Q4 operating results of our DTC businesses to improve by approximately $100 million relative to the prior-year quarter, driven by lower losses at Hulu and ESPN+ partially offset by our continued investment in Disney+. The 21CF businesses we acquired, excluding 21CF's stake in Hulu and net of inter-segment eliminations, contributed approximately $730 million in segment operating income in the third quarter. Consolidating Hulu's operating losses and netting out inter-segment eliminations resulted in a positive contribution to total segment operating income of about $490 million. While some of our affected businesses have reopened, we remain laser focused on prudently managing our cash outflows and preserving liquidity. We further strengthened our capital position during the quarter by issuing $11 billion of term debt in May at highly attractive rate. And we reduced our commercial paper balances by close to $2 billion during the quarter. We ended the quarter with $23 billion in cash and continue to feel we are well positioned to navigate through this time of uncertainty and continue to invest in the long-term future growth of our businesses. As we look ahead, there are a handful of items that we would like to give you an update on. First, you may recall that our fiscal 2020 calendar has an extra week of operations. This year, we expect that 53rd week will actually have a modest adverse impact on operating results in Q4 due to our current expectations of NBA finals, MLB playoffs and IPL games all occurring in the 53rd week, in addition to modest operating loss at Parks, Experiences, and Products. At Parks, Experiences, and Products. It's worth noting that while Walt Disney World is operating at a positive net contribution level, the upside we are seeing some reopening is less than we had originally expected given the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in Florida. We also anticipate Q4 results at our Consumer Products business will reflect a difficult comparison to Frozen and Star Wars merchandise sales in the prior-year quarter as well as the ongoing disruption of retail operations caused by COVID-19. Finally, we have continued to refine our capital spending plan and we now expect total CapEx for fiscal 2020 to be approximately $700 million lower than prior year, largely due to lower spending at our domestic parks and resorts. These are certainly fluid times and we are proud of our management team and cast members for going above and beyond to position our company well for a very exciting future. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell and we would be happy to take your questions.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks, Christine. And as we transition to the Q&A, let me note that since we are not physically together this afternoon, I will do my best to moderate by directing your questions to the appropriate executive, and with that, Daniel, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAlexia Quadrani: I have two questions. The first one is on the studio and the second one the parks. On the studio, do you think moving sort of big tentpole films, you know, direct-to-consumer is going to be more of a common occurrence for Disney? Or is Mulan kind of a one-off? I mean, how should we think about Black Widow I guess later in the fall? And then on the parks, I guess any color on how much the accretive opening of Walt Disney World is eating away the losses in the parks. I think you said. Christine, that it's eating away or it's less accretive maybe than you thought it would be initially because of the surge of Corona. I'm curious to that because demand isn't as strong as you thought it would be or because you're just having to keep capacity lower and more careful because of the surge. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Okay, Alexia, thanks. Bob, why don't we - let's start with first question, why don't you take the studio question and then we'll get to the parks one.\nBob Chapek: We are very pleased to be able to bring Mulan to our consumer base has been waiting for it for a long, long time as we've had to unfortunately move our theatrical dates several times. We are fortunate that we have the opportunity to bring it to our own direct-to-consumer platforms. So consumers can enjoy it. But we're looking at Mulan as a one-off in terms of, as opposed to say trying to say that there is some new business window we model that we're looking at. So Mulan is a one-off. That said, we find it very interesting to be able to take a new offering, our premier access offering to consumers at that $29.99 price and learn from it and see what happens not only in terms of the uptake of the number of subscribers that we get on the platform, but the actual number of transactions on the Disney+ platform that we get on that PVOD offering.\nLowell Singer: And then on the parks question, Bob, maybe want to speak to demand, and then Christine, you could jump in on some of the numbers.\nBob Chapek: Yes, this is obviously a highly uncertain time and we could tell from our reservation stream that we had ample demand to go above what the six-foot social distancing guidelines would give us, that was six weeks before we opened the park when we announced we were opening the park and then unfortunately COVID struck again and all the numbers started going up. This gave some level of trepidation to travelers who are anxious about long distance travel, jumping on a plane and flying to Walt Disney World. So what we've seen is that we have roughly 50% of our guest base still traveling from a distance, but the other 50% coming from local markets and in state. We've also had a higher-than-expected level of cancellations once somebody does make a reservation because as the disease ebbs and flows, they might necessarily cancel. So what we've done is used our strategy for yielding and make sure that every day we're pretty close to the percentage of the park that we can fill and still maintain the social distancing, we just replaced local and annual pass holders with some of the fall-off that we've necessarily seen from the long distance travelers. I will say that our research indicates that - and our bookings indicate that we should be in good shape once consumer confidence sort of returns, and so we're very optimistic about that, but we're very happy that we're returning a positive net contribution, as Christine said, because that was our goal in the first place, while at the same time, operating very responsibly.\nChristine McCarthy: Alexia, I'll put a little context into what we're referring to as a net positive contribution. On our last earnings call, Bob mentioned that we would not be opening a park unless we believe that we could shortly after opening generate revenue that exceeded the variable costs. So we are able to do that, although it is to a lesser extent because of the current COVID situation in Florida, as we said, as that abates, we expect the demand to pick up. But right now, it's not as high as we had expected, but we're still in the net positive contribution level. And I'd also like to mention Shanghai has consistently been operating in that net positive contribution area as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBen Swinburne: I wanted to ask about the international general entertainment DTC launch, which I think is not a huge surprise that you're moving forward although calendar '21 I think a bit earlier than we were expecting, but doing it under the Star brand is an interesting twist versus a Hulu. I'm wondering if you could just give us a sense for the strategy there and what you're looking at in terms of case of deployment, anything you can tell us, I'm sure there's a lot coming in the Investor Day about that strategy because obviously that's a big news. And then just following along on direct-to-consumer, forget about Mulan for a second, but from your access as an offering is an interesting strategy, I'm just wondering what your research tells you about that approach versus offering more content as part of the Disney+ subscription? We haven't seen sort of this idea of subscription service with the kind of a pay-per-view element on top of it, which is really interesting. I'm wondering if you're thinking about using that on a regular basis globally on the Disney+ platform? Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Thanks for the questions, Ben, and I'll turn those over to Bob.\nBob Chapek: In terms of the general entertainment offering internationally, we want to mirror successful Disney+ strategy by using our Disney+ technical platform, rooting it in content that we already own and distributing it under a successful international brand that we also already own which is of course Star and then bringing it to market in a very close association to Disney. I think in terms of your being surprised that this isn't being launched under a different brand name, I think it's important to look at the differences in how we have plan on going into the market, and the first thing is that Hulu aggregates third-party content where this will not. This will be rooted in our own content from ABC studios, Fox TV, FX, Freeform, Searchlight, and 20th century, and Hulu also, I must say has no brand awareness outside of the U.S. and nor does Hulu have any content that's been licensed to it internationally. So this gives us the ability to market this under the Disney umbrella and have synergies with our existing platform. So that's our basic rationale there. In terms of the premier access idea, as you probably know, Disney tentpole blockbuster theatrical films can be fairly expensive to make and produce in order to get the quality that consumers expect from us and frankly to get the quality that we expect from us, and rather than simply rolling it into a free offering, we thought we would give again because we can test almost anything when you have your own platform, we thought we would give it a try to establish a new window - a premier access window to try to recapture some of that investment that we've got and the good news, as I mentioned in my opening comments, is that we're going to have a chance to learn from this and to see whether that makes sense. All I'll say about our research is that it shows that such an offering under a premier access offering not only gets us revenue from the original transaction from the PVOD but also acts as a fairly large stimulus to sign up for Disney+.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: A couple of questions. First, could you provide updates on some of your past guidance, specifically on Disney+, you've exceeded your low-end of your five-year outlook, but you haven't said anything about reaching break-even sooner or not. And within the Disney+, if you could give us some color on Japan, which has always been a very enthusiastic Disney branded market. But the other update was on Fox, the Fox synergy, the $2 billion that you've given us in the past. And then just moving on to kind of current stuff on production, I mean obviously with the new protocols, costs will go up. If can you give us any color on what percent or how you think about that and who will be bearing the cost of that? Will there - do you expect to get a national insurance plan in place? I mean just there's so much complication there and then I was just hoping you could talk about maybe the original ramp, how will you prioritize getting back to work on production?\nLowell Singer: All right, Jessica, it's good to hear from you. We will try to get to as many of your questions as we can. So Christine, let's start with Jessica's question about Disney+ guidance, and Japan and synergies. Let's start with that group.\nChristine McCarthy: We'll see if I can remember all these in sequential order. So on updating guidance, we're in the process now of working through our long-term plan, just because of COVID and all the disruption to our business, it's a little bit delayed from a typical calendar schedule, but we are not going to update piecemeal, we're going to give you a full update of the guidance we provided at the original Investor Day when we do the upcoming Investor Day in a few months. So you can expect to hear a fulsome review of the guidance and what we're looking for now because obviously things have gone better than expected and we are growing into momentum here. On Japan, Disney+ launched on June 11 in Japan and it wasn't a full - I would call it a limited launch, it was an exclusive alliance with NTT DOCOMO, so that was not provide - you had to be an NTT DOCOMO subscriber in order to have that ability. So you shouldn't be looking that at a full country launch. So I think you can anticipate that once it is launched, there will be more demand for Disney+ in that market, because you're absolutely right, there is a very, very high affinity for the Disney brand in Japan. I think you also had a question on Fox synergies. We are still on track to achieve the synergies that we had discussed originally and that is going along. Even despite COVID, we're still proceeding\nLowell Singer: And then just got a question about restarting production as well. Christine, do you want to take that one?\nChristine McCarthy: Sure. In my prepared comments, I said that we would incur around $1 billion of costs between now and the end of fiscal '21 and that's a variety of things, it's everything from ramping up productions and you can imagine these productions, they have everything from distancing that you have to accommodate for, site preparation, stage preparation, all the testing that has to go on. So there's a lot of increased costs and what those also will result in is increased days to produce episodes. So all of those things will incur costs. As I mentioned, we will be capitalizing Many of those costs that are related to productions and those will be amortized in future periods. And also in parks, as you've heard from us, there is considerable costs that have been put in place to achieve safety and health measures and those largely are expensed in the parks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Your line is now open.\nJohn Hodulik: Just maybe two quick ones. First, Bob, can you talk a bit about some of the new program you're going to have on the Disney+ platform in the fall. Are you confident that you've got a strong enough lineup that you can sustain the growth that you've recently seen both in the U.S. and some of these international markets given the production halt and the need to restart that? And then secondly, although it's not as immediate of a concern, but you guys suspended the dividend, I think that was on the last call, any thoughts to sort of reinstating that and sort of just capital allocation as we look forward and especially with the new sort of more aggressive stance on D2C. Thanks.\nLowell Singer: John, thanks for the questions. Bob, why don't you take the production question for the fall, and Christine, you'll take the dividend question\nBob Chapek: As you may suspect, while we've had to slow down production and cease it altogether In some cases during the COVID time, we've been busy developing new content and we're extremely excited about some of the things that we've got not only to sustain that linear growth that you talked about for Disney+ but actually go beyond that and grow it. We've got, of course, The Mandalorian 2 which we've announced is coming in October. But we've also got a slew of Marvel content that's going to be coming that we're very excited about and these require us to re-enter into production, but it's such a priority that we're hopeful that this will be coming shortly to enable us to again not only sustain but continue to grow and I would tell you that the content is fabulous, Loki, Falcon and Winter Soldier and Wandavision 3, Marvel properties that we're really, really excited about. And one of the things about Disney+ that we found is that new content tends to bring in new subscribers by catalog increases engagement and helps us retain subscribers. So I think that this new content having so much of this all at once that I think it's really going to go ahead and propel the business forward. Christine?\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, John. So let me just make a couple of comments on the dividend. As you know, management recommended and the Board decided to accept that recommendation not to pay dividend for the first half of fiscal '20 and that was the payment that would have been made in July and we all believe that that decision provided the company with additional financial flexibility given what we were seeing in the in the COVID environment we're in and all the uncertainty that we're dealing with and continue to deal with. So our Board would typically determine whether or not to declare a dividend for the second half of fiscal '20 in the latter part of the calendar year, it would be very late November, early December, and making the recommendation to the Board, we, again, were going to take into consideration. Where we are with COVID and the impact that it's having not only on our financial performance but what measures we are taking to mitigate COVID impacts. So we'll take the full financial picture into consideration and it is part of our overall capital allocation principles, but first and foremost, we are going to invest in businesses that we believe are going to drive long-term shareholder value, and you're seeing what we're doing in the direct-to-consumer initiatives, not only domestically with Disney+, internationally with Disney+ and now internationally with the General Entertainment channel. So we feel like that's certainly top of the list, but we are also looking at other measures like a dividend, but we won't make that decision or recommendation to the Board until the end of the close to the end of the calendar year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nMichael Nathanson: I have two for you Lowell. One is, on the rollout of the new channel, you talk a bit about how you think about the AVOD/SVOD hybrid that's worked in the U.S., is that the template to think about globally? And then this is just concerned about college football and pro football not being in a bubble and I wondered just generally what risk is there to affiliate fees if those seasons don't get completed? So anything to help us on on ESPN and maybe those sports that are not in a bubble and risk to your affiliate fees in the next six months or so.\nLowell Singer: Okay, thanks for the questions. Michael. Bob, do you want to take both of those.\nBob Chapek: Yes, in terms of the Star offering that we announced today, we see this as part of a sort of a sequential Domino strategy in terms of getting towards an offering on Disney+ starting with the PVOD going through some transactional window after we have an exclusive on Disney+ for the PVOD details to be announced later and then eventually going to Disney+ will live in perpetuity. Now, I should also say that we think that the Star brand itself in terms of its offerings, we've got a utility here, we've got a utility that is enabled on obviously platforms. I did mention to you that we will have the ability to use the same platform across both Disney+ and Star, so that if theoretically we can afford to do something on one particular platform like Disney+ we should be able to do it on a Star platform. It's not something we've talked about or entertained, but the capability is there. In terms of the Fox - in terms of the college football and the likelihood that in place, I don't really want to comment on the possibility of us going on the season going on because I think that's really up to the League Commissioners, that being said, we feel that we've got certain covenants that we have to meet in terms of live permitting hours with our partners, and we feel confident that with the way that we see all of the sports going on right now, we feel confident that we're going to be able to reach that.\nMichael Nathanson: Bob, is it just the AVOD/SVOD as strategy as you did with Hulu in the U.S.?\nBob Chapek: Yes, well, we have no planned AVOD/SVOD on Star itself, but we've got obviously similar capabilities as we've got to Disney+ if we ever so chose to do that, but we've got no plans to do that now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Your line is now open.\nJason Bazinet: I love that you guys are always conservative with the capital and recognize you said it was a low cost of debt in terms of the latest capital raise, but $23 billion is a cash that sits on the balance sheet, it seems excessive even under the most dire scenarios in terms of free cash burn, you could anticipate. So can you maybe just explain a little bit behind your thinking behind that quantum of capital and what it might be used for? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Jason, thanks for the question. Christine, you want to take that.\nChristine McCarthy: Sure. Thanks, Jason. You're right. We do take somewhat of a conservative approach to managing liquidity and when we raise that money, it was back in March and April, we were able to achieve some pretty favorable interest rates but we also did not have any visibility into how long this environment was going to continue. We also saw some weeks in the spring when they weren't consistent capital markets conditions. So you'd have some weeks when spreads gapped out, sometimes they tighten up and we took the position that get it when we can and because the demand was so high we decided to take it because we view it somewhat as an insurance policy. But when we look at the overall balance sheet, we have it and we see COVID continuing for a while, but one of the, there is a few things that have happened in our businesses. And one is just the way that we have probably been much better at cost mitigation than we anticipated. The whole company is aligned towards tightening the belt. And we've done, I think, a great job on that. But as we are opening up the parks, remember now, we furloughed over 100,000 people and we're bringing them back. For the most part, not all are back yet, but a lot are back. So we will be spending more money just in terms of labor than we did in the third quarter. So in the fourth quarter you'll see some of our costs actually go up to resume some of our businesses. So I look at this as, as we all know what kills the company is the lack of liquidity. And as a CFO, I would never want to be in that position of not being able to fund all of our obligations.\nJason Bazinet: That makes perfect sense, but none of that capital is really earmarked to sort of pulling the minority stake in Hulu that you don't own, that was not part of that again?\nChristine McCarthy: No, if you look at that, that's out a couple of more years. So, and the other thing is we do have debt maturities coming up. We still have another about $1.1 billion this fiscal year. If my memory is correct. I think $3.5 billion for fiscal ' 21. So we've got some debt maturities that we don't have to go to market and if this cash is still on our balance sheet, we can just certainly repay that and not refinance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nKannan Venkateshwar: So a couple if I could. First is, Christine, the $5 billion charge that you took for international markets, I guess this is a question for Bob as well. But broadly, does this mean that you could potentially use this as a way to pull more channels and go direct-to-consumer in other markets. I think you've done a little bit of that in the UK with some channels, but could that become a bigger possibility in other markets, now that you've written down this asset? And then secondly, Bob. From your perspective, when you look at ESPN obviously cord cutting is accelerating just given what the cable companies have said so far. Is there an alternative state of the world where ESPN could go direct to consumers and have you looked at that model in terms even perspective? Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Kannan, thanks for the questions. Christine, why don't you speak to the $5 billion charge, and Bob, you speak to ESPN. Thanks.\nChristine McCarthy: So that's a great question and I'm glad you asked that. So, I can put some color around this impairment. So, the best way I would frame it is this impairment reflects an underperformance of the international channels business that we are already seeing and then that was exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19. Coupled with that, we've learned a lot with the launch of Disney+ and we have, as you've heard today, accelerated our push into DTC consumer streaming and - with the same time you're seeing a decline in the subscriber on MVPD subscriber base outside of the U.S. So, you add all those things up and we're not - this impairment does not include the value of DTC, that's intact. What this impairment is about is the linear channels and so we have in this fiscal year, have already closed down more than 20 channels. Most of those were closed in this third quarter and they were primarily in APAC and in EMEA. Now, when I say APAC not in India, these are in other parts of Asia. But that's where the channels were closed and we're taking a look at going more quickly, as you said, into direct-to-consumer and these channels shutting them down and taking those platforms direct is certainly what is behind this impairment.\nBob Chapek: And in terms of the ESPN question, let me first start off by saying that on a macro level, I think we understand the value of live sports, ESPN is a strongest brand in sports and sports continue to be a driver of viewing interest. I think it's evidenced by the fact that sports accounted for over 90 of the 100 most viewed telecasts on broadcast and cable in 2019. So, we've got a really strong position from a brand standpoint in a market that consumers love. So, then the question is, how do we get it to the consumer and certainly U.S. that whether we've looked at a stronger direct-to-consumer proposition for ESPN? Absolutely, we've looked at everything and when we think that we've got the most effective way to maximize shareholder value from the brand, the way we are right now, but as that changes over time, we're certainly open to any and all options in terms of how we maybe able to get our programs to our consumers and hopefully we can talk a little bit more about this in our investor conference when we meet in the next few months.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nSteven Cahall: Maybe first just wanted to clarify on parks, Bob, with the lower contribution margin in Orlando, could you just help us think through some of that disruption that you had. Was that more about not being able to get as many people in the parks, or was that more of per capita spend or pricing issue that caused the contribution margin to come in lower? And maybe you could update a little bit on what you're seeing in terms of pricing and occupancy at the hotels as well. And then on Disney+ I'm curious, I mean you've had this amazing ramp up to the low end of guidance, as you think about the next stage of growth for Disney+, does it make more sense to kind of go after a bigger market of subscribers, which can be pretty expensive in terms of original content. Are you more kind of focused on getting to like more of a plateau with this Disney+ and driving it more towards profitability with the content that you've already got planned in the pipeline that's more around the film slate and the existing characters? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: Steve maybe Christine you want to just at least start on the parks' metrics and then Bob, you may want to comment on parks and then talk about Disney+ as well.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, Steve. So, when we were talking about the net positive contribution opening up Walt Disney World what we were referring to was that because there was a surge of COVID in Florida, which limited amount of inbound travel that we had originally anticipated. So, it's more local, that overall is having a little bit of a dampening effect on it, but it's still positive, and once again, it will pick up when there is more regular travel patterns going into Walt Disney World. And as it relates to sort of pricing and occupancy at the hotel, It's really like there are so many hotels that are not yet reopened. And so those are kind of meaningless numbers right now. So once I would say the travel patterns get a little more normalized and we see people going in and staying for regular vacations like they used to we'll be providing occupancy and booking numbers, but right now, the one thing I would add is per caps are very, very strong and you could say that that's probably because people haven't been in the parks for a while, there is a pent-up demand and let's not forget that we just opened the full - the rise of the resistance as well as the Star Wars Lands fully in the beginning of this calendar year. So, you had a lot of people and even Floridians who were just traveling locally who have not yet had an opportunity to go in and experience that. So, the per caps are great and I think it's because people haven't been able to get into our parks for quite a long time.\nBob Chapek: I'll follow up on the parks question is that, as you know, different guests depending on where they're coming from have different relative values in terms of their contribution as a guest to the park and typically someone who travels and stays for five days to seven days is marginally more valuable to the business than someone who comes in on an annual pass and stays a day or two and consumes less merchandise and food and beverage. So, the way I would look at it is that it's just as their constituency changes a little bit, so do our overall margins change, but it's not because of price reductions or anything like that. And I think Christine handled the pricing and occupancy in hotels. On the Disney+ we absolutely are going after a bigger market of the number of subscribers as opposed to over rotating to try to get to a profitability number much sooner than we thought. Although I must say the prospect of us hitting our goals as quickly as we are is very encouraging, but what we plan to do is invest even more in our content in order to keep that machine cranked and going. As I mentioned, one of the biggest things in terms of subscriber acquisition is having new hot [indiscernible] content to bring to the service and you get that by making investments in new content. So, we'll be investing in content first and then trying to grow the service both from a marketing standpoint and from an installed base standpoint.\nLowell Singer: Steve, thanks for the questions and thanks again everyone for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nLowell Singer: Good afternoon and welcome to The Walt Disney Company\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today\u2019s call is also being webcast and the webcast and a transcript will also be available on our website. We hope you are all staying home and we realized that most of you are joining us today from your homes. And given Los Angeles County\u2019s Safer at Home order, we are hosting today\u2019s call remotely. So joining me from their homes are Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s Chairman; Bob Chapek, Disney\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob Iger, Bob Chapek and Christine, we will be happy to take some questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob Iger to get started.\nBob Iger: Thanks, Lowell and good afternoon, everyone. Obviously, much has changed in the world since our last earnings call and the challenges we are now facing are unprecedented. Like so many other companies and industries, the pandemic has hit us hard and both Bob and Christine will walk you through the specifics. However, as someone who has been around for awhile and let this company through some really tough days over the last 15 years, including economic downturns, natural disasters and other unforeseen events, I have absolute confidence in our ability to get through this challenging period and recover successfully. The Walt Disney Company has demonstrated repeatedly over its nearly 100-year history that it is exceptionally resilient. And I believe this time will be no different. We entered this crisis with a strong hand and an exceptional management team now led by Bob Chapek. And as we said in February, when Bob was announced as CEO, he and I continue to work in partnership in support of the company\u2019s objectives and to ensure a smooth and successful transition. As you would expect when dealing with a challenge of this magnitude, the entire team is working closely together taking an all hands on deck approach to address the difficult issues we are facing. Of course, one key to our resilience is the strength of our brands and the strong emotional connection people have to them: Disney, Pixar, Marvel, ABC, ESPN and Star Wars. In fact, recent studies have shown we have maintained that connection with consumers throughout this crisis. We also have a tremendous collection of assets. And beyond that, what we create has never been more necessary or more important than right now. In fact, it\u2019s quite possible that what we create is appreciated now more than ever, because people find comfort and inspiration in our messages of hope and optimism. This is the same reason we believe people will resume familiar activities once this crisis ends. They missed doing the things they enjoy things that make them feel happy and connected with family and friends, whether it\u2019s going to movie theaters to see our films or visiting our theme parks around the world or watching live sports on ESPN. People want good news. They want to experience joy and the feeling of togetherness. And for all these reasons, we will continue to tell stories that uplift and enrich people\u2019s lives. While much of our operations are shutdown, we have been fortunate to keep parts of our creative pipeline active, including a number of writing and development projects, while also continuing postproduction work from media networks, our studios and Disney+. And I have been working with our creative teams across the company and I am extremely excited about what\u2019s in store. I have no doubt that we will get through this, but it will take some time. Before I turn it over to Bob and Christine to talk about the quarter and the strategy going forward and to answer your questions, I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude for all of the medical professionals across our country who are fighting valiantly to save lives and to everyone helping to flatten the curve by heeding the advice of health officials and others, it\u2019s all making a difference. On behalf of Bob and myself, I also want to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees around the world who continue to show incredible ingenuity, commitment, patience and understanding during these trying times. Even in the face of adversity, their dedication to our company and our mission is unwavering and we couldn\u2019t be more proud of them. And with that, I will hand it over to Bob.\nBob Chapek: Thanks, Bob and good afternoon everyone. I hope you are all doing well and staying safe. When I stepped into this new job, 2.5 months ago, none of us could have imagined the suffering and sacrifice that we are now seeing around the world. This devastating pandemic is like nothing most of us have ever experienced in our lifetime. This had a profound impact on millions of lives, physically, psychologically, financially causing tremendous hardship and loss. And just about everyone has been affected in one way or another either personally or through someone they know a friend, family member neighbor, or colleague. Fortunately, amidst the adversity, we see the best of humanity demonstrated through inspiring acts of compassion and selflessness from the courageous healthcare workers caring for people on the frontlines in hospitals across the country, to our first responders and others providing essential services throughout our communities. We are grateful for and deeply appreciative of their efforts. Here at Disney, as Bob mentioned, we are also grateful to our own employees, starting with our local and national ABC News teams providing critical and factual information around the clock; our ESPN team providing compelling programming in the absence of live sports, our global security personnel and key staff who are safeguarding and maintaining our parks and resorts, they are doing a phenomenal job and we could not be more proud of them. As you know, Disney, like many other companies, has experienced widespread disruption. In mid-March, we have closed our domestic parks and hotels indefinitely, suspended our cruise line, halted film and TV productions and shuttered our retail stores. And while these were necessary steps to ensure the safety and well-being of our guest and employees, our businesses have been hugely impacted. In the second fiscal quarter, adjusted EPS fell to $0.60 a share from $1.61 a year earlier primarily due to the suspended operations I just outlined. Christine will talk more in depth about our results for the quarter and the ongoing financial impact of COVID-19. Before she does, I want to share a few thoughts on the destruction we are seeing across our company as well as our confidence and our ability to weather the storm. While it\u2019s too early to predict when we will be able to begin resuming all of our operations, we are evaluating a number of different scenarios to ensure a cautious, sensible and deliberate approach to the eventual reopening of our parks. As you know, our parks have been closed around the world, Shanghai and Hong Kong since January, Tokyo since February, and our U.S. and Paris parks since mid-March. The approach we take may include implementation of guest capacity and density control measures as well as health and prevention procedures that comply with state and federal guidelines. We are seeing encouraging signs of a gradual return to some semblance of normalcy in China. And in light of the lifting of certain restrictions in recent weeks and the successful reopening of our park adjacent retail and food and beverage area, Disneytown, we and our government partners, Shanghai Shendi Group, plan to open Shanghai Disneyland on May 11. We will take a phased approach with limits on attendance using an advanced reservation and entry system, controlled guest density using social distancing and strict government required health and prevention procedures. These include the use of masks, temperature screenings and other contact tracing and early detection systems. Moving to Media Networks, ESPN has truly stepped up in the absence of live sports finding new and innovative ways to deliver compelling content that fans want. This included releasing, 2 months early, the highly anticipated 10-part docuseries on Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, The Last Dance. The series, which continues through May 17, is the most viewed ESPN documentary ever and currently ranks as the number one program in America, amongst all key male demos since sports halted. ESPN also took what has historically been an engaging life event and turn into a virtual one with the NFL draft. This resulted in the bigger audience than ever before with a record 55 million plus viewers over the 3-day event. The draft was a particularly impressive technological feet driven by more than 600 remote camera feeds from homes across the U.S. When you look at the impact of these two events, ESPN\u2019s April prime-time audience, was up 11% versus last year among adults 18 to 49. In fact, it tanked as the top cable network among this key demographic. Going forward, ESPN is going to be rolling out three new films as part of its award winning 30 for 30 series. We are also going to air virtual 2020 ESPYs on June 21. Additionally, ESPN will be bringing back several more of its marquee studio programs beginning in the week of May 11. This will expand their live and quick turnaround studio programming to 11 straight hours each weekday. Sports will come back strong. And when they do, we believe ESPN is best positioned to benefit with more offerings than anyone else. And if it\u2019s a gradual process, where sports return for a period without spectators in the stance, we can count on ESPN to bring the same level of innovations that we saw with the NFL draft and continue to deliver our great experience for sports fans. On the studio side, we are incredibly excited about our upcoming slate of films. However, with theatres closed and our production shutdown due to COVID-19, we have had to reschedule a number of release dates for tentpole movies. These include Disney\u2019s Mulan for July 24, Marvel\u2019s Black Widow for November 6, Pixar\u2019s Soul on November 20, and 20th Century\u2019s Free Guy set for December 11. As many of your already know, Artemis Fowl, originally slated for a theatrical run, will debut exclusively in Disney+ starting on June 12. As we have said, our company\u2019s top priority and our key to our growth is our direct-to-consumer business. And I am pleased to say that the response to Disney+ in particular has exceeded even our highest expectations. We have been thrilled with the performance of the service since our initial launch in November and we continue to expand into other markets. In late March, as planned and despite COVID-19, we had an incredibly successful launch of Disney+ in Western Europe, followed by a highly successful launch in India. We announced in early April that in just 5 months we have surpassed 50 million subscribers globally, a significant milestone for us. We have been quite pleased with the growth that we have seen in the 4 weeks since then and there is more to come. Disney+ will begin rolling out in Japan in June, followed by the Nordics, Belgium, Luxembourg and Portugal in September and Latin America will follow towards the end of the year. This robust collection of library and original content available on Disney+ continues to grow, including with Disney\u2019s Frozen 2 and Pixar\u2019s Onward, which were released early as a special offering for families as a shelter at home. Yesterday\u2019s SVOD premier of Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker and the new behind the scenes documentary about the making of one of Disney+\u2019s most successful series, The Mandalorian, along with the fall premier of National Geographic\u2019s original series, The Right Stuff, based on the book by Tom Wolfe about NASA\u2019s Project Mercury. This quarter, Hulu saw the successful launch of FX on Hulu. Nearly, 45% of Hulu subscribers have accessed library, current and original content from the FX network on the service. Also, Hulu\u2019s strong original series continue to perform extremely well as evidenced by the critically acclaimed hit series, Little Fires Everywhere, amongst others. Hulu had 32 million total subscribers at the end of Q2. We are enormously proud of what we have accomplished to-date and we are optimistic for the future. As I said earlier, our businesses have experienced considerable disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This forced us to implement a variety of measures to manage the short and long-term financial impact on our company. The first was a substantial reduction in senior executive compensation company-wide, which will remain in effect until we see a substantive economic recovery. We were fortunate for the first 5 weeks to be able to pay full salaries to those employees who were unable to perform their duties. However, with no way to predict when this crisis will end, we made the very difficult decision to begin the furloughs on April 19. Unlike layoffs, the furlough process allows impacted workers to remain as Disney employees, while continuing to receive their full healthcare benefits paid for by the company. We are fully committed to getting our employees back to work as quickly as the current situation allows. While these were not easy decisions, I do believe they have been the right ones given the unprecedented challenges that we are faced with. Now, before I turn it over to Christine, let me just reiterate what Bob said and that is Disney is an exceptionally resilient company. With a great management team and thousands of talented and dedicated employees, we continue to deliver exceptional brands, franchises and storytelling that consumers around the world have demonstrated a tremendous affinity for and we are confident that we will emerge from this crisis in a strong position. With that, I will turn it over to Christine to talk more about the quarter and then we will be happy to answer your questions.\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks, Bob and good afternoon, everyone. These are truly unprecedented times and the COVID-19 pandemic has affected our company in a number of significant ways. From a financial standpoint, we estimate the adverse impact of COVID-19 related disruption on our second quarter operating income with as much as $1.4 billion, with the majority of that impact at our Parks, Experiences and Products segment. As a result, excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter were $0.60. Bob Chapek highlighted a number of steps we have already taken to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our financial performance. We have also been very focused on strengthening our liquidity position to ensure we have adequate resources to fund our operations during this crisis. Our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong. Those who have followed the company over the years know that we have historically taken a prudent approach to managing our balance sheet and liquidity. So despite the current business challenges, we believe we start from a position of relative strength. We took proactive and decisive steps during the quarter to further enhance our liquidity position by issuing $6 billion of term debt, which contributed to a cash and cash equivalents balance of $14.3 billion to end the quarter. And a week after the quarter ended, we issued another $925 million in term debt. Last month, we closed on a new $5 billion 364-day bank facility, which combined with our existing credit facilities of $12.25 billion, provides us with total credit facility capacity of $17.25 billion. I will note that the $12.25 credit facilities also serve to backstop our commercial paper program. We are evaluating a wide range of scenarios with respect to the potential ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our businesses, while prudently managing cash outflows. And overall, we feel confident in our ability to manage through the crisis. We continue to actively evaluate additional mitigation strategies to position our company to emerge from this crisis with the financial flexibility necessary to get back on a growth path. From a cash flow standpoint, the Board has made the decision to forego payment of a semi-annual dividend for the first half of the fiscal year, which would have been payable in July. This preserves about $1.6 billion in cash assuming we had held the dividend constant at $0.88 per share. We also identified opportunities to reduce our capital spending and we now expect total CapEx for fiscal 2020 to be about $900 million lower than our prior guidance, or $400 million below prior year, driven primarily by paused construction and refurbishment work due to the temporary closing of our parks. While it is still too early to consider more specific implications for capital spending in fiscal 2021, we remain confident in our investment decisions and the resiliency of our businesses. Prior to the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic with the exception of Hong Kong Disneyland, the rest of our parks and experiences businesses were trending well ahead of prior year. As we had previously disclosed, Hong Kong Disneyland faced challenges due to significant declines in visitation from China and other parts of Asia. Attendance at our domestic parks was down 11% in the second quarter. I\u2019ll remind you that the Disneyland Resort closed on March 14 and Walt Disney World closed March 16. We estimate the closure of our domestic parks had an adverse impact on attendance growth of approximately 18 percentage points. Per capita guest spending during the period the parks were open was up 13% on higher admissions, merchandise and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 6% and occupancy was down 16 points to 77%, which reflects a 13% decline in occupied room nights. We estimate the closure of our domestic hotels had an adverse impact on occupied room nights of approximately 15 points. As a result of the unprecedented disruptions to our businesses, Q2 operating income at Parks, Experiences and Products was significantly lower compared to Q2 last year. We estimate the disruption to our Parks, Experiences and Products businesses adversely impacted Q2 operating income by approximately $1 billion. As we look ahead, while we\u2019ve announced plans to reopen Shanghai Disney Resort, there is limited visibility into the timing of reopening and the conditions under which we can reopen the rest of our parks and resorts, cruise ships and Disney stores. However, we believe the strength of our brands and our unwavering commitment to the guest experience are valuable assets that will serve us and our guests well once we reopen. At Studio Entertainment, operating income was lower in the quarter as higher TV/SVOD distribution results at our legacy film studio were more than offset by higher film impairments, lower worldwide theatrical distribution results at our legacy film studio and a decline in our stage play business due to the impact of COVID-19. Worldwide theatrical results in the quarter were adversely impacted by higher bad debt reserves for receivables due from exhibitors and by lower revenue due to the closure of theaters around the world. In aggregate, the performance of key titles in the quarter, which included Frozen 2, Star Wars, The Rise of Skywalker and Onward was comparable to key theatrical titles in Q2 last year, which included Captain Marvel, Mary Poppins Returns and Dumbo. We feel the performance of Onward was particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic given its release date relative to when theaters began to close. Higher legacy TV/SVOD results were driven by content sales to Disney+, including The Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Aladdin, partially offset by a decrease in sales to third parties. The 21CF studio business was a positive contributor in the quarter as higher operating income from TV/SVOD distribution more than offset an operating loss at worldwide theatrical and general and administrative costs. Turning to Media Networks, operating income was up in the second quarter due to higher results at broadcasting as cable operating income was roughly comparable to Q2 last year. At Broadcasting the increase in operating income was due to the consolidation of 21CF, largely reflecting program sales and to a lesser extent an increase in our legacy broadcasting operations. The increase at our legacy operations was due to higher affiliate revenue and lower programming and production costs, partially offset by lower program sales from ABC Studios and higher network marketing costs. The decrease in network programming and production costs was due to a timing benefit from new accounting guidance, partially offset by more hours of higher cost specials and a contractual rate increase for the Academy Awards in the current quarter. More detail on the new accounting guidance is contained in the 10-Q filing. But I\u2019ll note that while the new accounting guidance resulted in lower programming and production expense during the first half of the fiscal year, we expect programming and production expenses to be higher in the second half of the year as capitalized costs are amortized. Lower ABC Studios program sales reflect the prior year sale of Jessica Jones and How to Get Away with Murder in Q2 last year. Total broadcasting ad revenue was 3% higher in the quarter driven by consolidation of 21CF and higher political advertising at our owned stations. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was comparable to Q2 last year. Cable results reflect the consolidation of the 21CF cable businesses, largely offset by a decrease at ESPN where growth in affiliate revenue was more than offset by higher programming and production costs and lower advertising revenue. Higher programming and production costs at ESPN were primarily driven by contractual rate increases for the College Football Playoffs and college basketball and costs associated with the launch of the ACC Network. Total ESPN advertising revenue was down approximately 8% in the second quarter as higher rates were more than offset by lower average viewership. Total viewership was negatively impacted by the cancellation of live sporting events in the latter part of the quarter, primarily NBA and college basketball championship week. So far this quarter ESPN\u2019s domestic linear cash ad sales are pacing significantly below this time last year, reflecting the current challenges in the marketplace due to the lack of live sports inventory coupled with limited advertiser demand. However, we have seen a couple of bright spots so far this quarter with record viewership for the first six episodes of The Last Dance, our highest-rated original documentary of all time. Additionally, the NFL Draft, was the most watched ever, reaching more than 55 million viewers over the three-day event and average audience growth of 58% on ESPN versus last year. The performance of these two events suggests there is meaningful pent-up demand from fans for compelling sports programming and ESPN continues to be well positioned to capitalize on this demand. Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 16% and reflects the consolidation of 21CF and growth at both cable and broadcasting. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by 13 points of growth from the acquisition of 21CF and 7 points from higher rates, partially offset by a 3 point decline due to a decrease in subscribers which benefited by about 2.5 points due to the launch of the ACC Network. At our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment operating losses were $427 million higher in the quarter driven by costs incurred to support the ongoing launch of Disney+ around the world and the consolidation of Hulu. Disney+ launched in a number of European markets during the quarter, which contributed to a total paid subscriber base of $33.5 million at the end of the quarter. And we are very pleased with the success of our rollout in Western Europe and India, including the execution of previously announced deals with some European platforms to distribute the service to all paid subscribers on certain of the widely distributed tiers and in India to convert our pre-existing subscription based Hotstar service to Disney+ Hotstar. As we announced on April 8, during the third quarter, we exceeded 15 million Disney+ paid subscribers. More information about those launches is available in our Form 10-Q. Because we executed a number of launches between quarter-end and today, we have decided to bring these numbers current. As of May 4th, we estimate we had approximately 54.5 million Disney+ subscribers reflecting a subscriber mix generally similar to our mix at April 8. Segment results also reflect the consolidation of an operating loss at Hulu and a benefit from the consolidation of the 21CF international cable businesses. Results at our direct-to-consumer businesses had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of about $500 million, which came in a little better than the guidance we provided last quarter. We expect our direct-to-consumer and international segment to generate about $1.1 billion in operating losses for the third quarter and we expect the continued investment in our DTC services, in particular, Disney+ to drive an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income of our DTC businesses of approximately $420 million. Revenue eliminations increased $1.2 billion and profit eliminations increased $211 million compared to Q2 last year driven primarily by higher intersegment content sales from studio and media networks to DTCI. And finally, the 21CF businesses we acquired, excluding 21CF\u2019s stake in Hulu and net of inter-segment eliminations, contributed approximately $460 million in segment operating income in the second quarter. Consolidating Hulu\u2019s operating losses and netting out inter-segment eliminations resulted in a positive contribution to total segment operating income of about $200 million. We estimate the acquisition of 21CF and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu, had a dilutive impact on our Q2 EPS before purchase accounting, although it was less dilutive than we expected. This is obviously a very fluid situation and given the lack of visibility around when some businesses will reopen fully or partially and the conditions under which they reopen, we don\u2019t intend to provide specific guidance around our expectations for the remainder of the year. These are uncertain times and our people and businesses are being impacted in significant ways. Despite these near-term challenges, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for our company. And with that, I will turn the call over to Lowell and we would be happy to take your questions.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Christine. As we transition to the Q&A, let me note that since we are not physically together this afternoon, I am going to do my best to moderate by directing your questions to the appropriate executive. And with that, operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you. I will ask two questions. The first on the parks completely understand the lack of visibility, but is there anyway you can help us think about sort of the cash burn on that business assuming you are close through this quarter or even a monthly number, just some way to kind of dimensionalize the impact on the income statement as you move through this unprecedented situation on the parks would be very helpful? And then I was curious you guys are \u2013 you are probably going to be approaching the low end of your 2024 guidance on direct-to-consumer subscribers potentially by the end of this quarter based on the growth you are seeing, but certainly over the next couple of quarters. Given that faster ramp and what\u2019s happening with people staying at home and streaming more, I am just wondering if that\u2019s impacting your plans around investing in the business or \u2013 and if you think you will reach profitability sooner than originally laid out? Thanks. Thanks for your thoughts.\nLowell Singer: Okay, Ben. Thanks. I am going to turn those over to Christine to answer the first and start with the second.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. Hi, Ben. How are you? Hope you are doing well and your family as well.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you.\nChristine McCarthy: Let me answer the question on parks as best I can. As you know we are dealing with a situation that\u2019s very fluid and things are changing. So, the results that you saw for the second quarter reflect approximately 2ish weeks of our domestic parks being closed, because we closed Disneyland on the 14th and World on the 16. And then you had the Asian parks closed, Shanghai closed fully in January on the 25, Hong Kong closed on the 26, Tokyo, which is a royalty revenue stream that we get, that closed on the 29. So the $1 billion that was attributable to the parks business and products for the quarter just for that second quarter about $1 billion, you could roughly think of it that the two weeks domestic is a little over half. And then you have the Asian \u2013 or the international parks and cruise, which are the balance. So when you think about Hong Kong we already had issues that related to their own domestic issues. So we had already telegraphed that there would be some softness in Hong Kong and then this closure of the park just accelerated the losses there. And Shanghai had been doing quite well up until the moment that we are closed. And I am going to ask Bob Chapek if he has any other thoughts that he would like to add to that.\nBob Chapek: No, it\u2019s just that we were doing everything we can to mitigate the impact of the cash burn while we are obviously in this situation and we are trying to be as responsible as possible, both short term in terms of operating expenses and labor but also longer term in terms of how we allocate capital.\nLowell Singer: Okay. And Bob, do you want to start on the second question around Disney+ and then Christine if you want to add anything, feel free.\nBob Chapek: Sure. We are obviously thrilled with the progress of Disney+ and how we\u2019ve been able to increase the base there. We\u2019re not really prepared to update our guidance and certainly wouldn\u2019t give any projections in terms of when we would reach profitability. But we know that in terms of the actual investment in Disney+ that new programming, hit new programming like the Mandalorian certainly drives that business. And so I think we\u2019ll continue to make the planned investments into Disney+ as we always have with new and exciting programming to drive those subscription rates and retention.\nChristine McCarthy: And, Ben, I would just add that we are still launching in new markets. So while we have had a really good start to Disney+ we still think it\u2019s early and we\u2019ll update when it\u2019s appropriate.\nBen Swinburne: Okay. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Ben, thank you. Operator, net question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you very much. I hope everybody is safe and well. Just two quick questions, one follow-up and then a second question. Just following up on your comments on the parks, I wonder if you could tell us or just speak generally about what capacity you guys can operate at the park profitably and resume obviously when you do open, which I know is very fluid and we can\u2019t pinpoint that right now in terms of domestic opening, just trying to get a sense of what sort of capacity you think could still sort of get you to breakeven or profitability? And then my second question is just on the studio side of the business. We are on in one of the first tentpole movies scheduled to be released late July and I guess are you comfortable with opening that movies in what will most likely be minimal capacity at the theaters? I guess overall, how much of a consideration is also the international theater openings in your decision to begin to start releasing films in this climate?\nLowell Singer: Alright. Alexia, thanks for the questions. Bob Chapek, I\u2019ll turn that over to you.\nBob Chapek: Alright. Hello, Alexia in terms of how we look at our park reopening and what hurdle we need to make to have it make sense, we actually look at it as a positive net contribution to overhead and profit. Another word, it\u2019s not about break-even point for profitability necessarily, but just making a positive contribution at the net contribution level. So what we are thinking is that while every site is completely different, that\u2019s the approach that we\u2019re going to take. And frankly we would not reopen any park unless we can make at least a positive contribution to that overhead and operating profit level. In terms of the second question in terms of the studio and what type of audiences will Mulan see it when it opens up? We\u2019re going to get a pretty good idea of that because there is a competitive movie that opens up one week before our film does. And at that point we\u2019re hoping that there is some return to semblance of normal, in terms of number of screens that are opening in a number of showtimes for those movies. So our fingers are crossed. Obviously, that\u2019s our first big move of the gate. But again between some balance of limited number of seats in theaters as social distancing practiced by the exhibitors combined with what\u2019s got to be an incredible pent-up demand. I think, we will shortly find out and maybe we\u2019ll find out the week before was a competitive movie.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Alexia, thanks for the questions. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. Two questions as well and a clarification. Following along the lines of Ben\u2019s question, given the crisis has accelerated the shift toward streaming around the world, any change in your plan to pursue Hulu international launches next year? I could understand reasons to accelerate. I could understand that \u2013 the potential sort of costs of launching Hulu could also have you considering delaying that. On the film side, when do you think large-scale productions like Marvel films can start back up in terms of principal photography? And any comments on windows? There\u2019s a lot of buzz these days on launching new premium VOD window to try to replace some of the theatrical revenue that might be lost. The quick clarification, the Shanghai reopening, the masks are just for employees or for employees and for guests? Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Doug. Thanks. I\u2019m going to turn those over to Bob Chapek.\nBob Chapek: Okay. In terms of our interest in Hulu internationally, given everything that\u2019s happening, you said you can make an argument either away, frankly we, long-term, are still bullish about Hulu international. Right now though, given the cash situation and the sort of uncertainty around our overall business, we\u2019ve got no plans immediately to make any investment in that business internationally. But that again is short term only because of the COVID situation that we\u2019re sort of faced with. And the second question was again?\nLowell Singer: Production \u2013 large-scale production and then window.\nBob Chapek: Oh, large-scale production and when will it \u2013 yes. In terms of large-scale production, we\u2019re going to go through the same process with our productions as we do our theme parks in terms of absolutely guaranteeing that we\u2019re going to be responsible in terms of how we put both our own employees and other filmmakers that are partners with us as they do these productions. So we\u2019ve got no projections of exactly when we can do that, but we will be very responsible in terms of mask and the same type of procedures that we would hope to implement into our parks when we sort of proceed. And the third question?\nDoug Mitchelson: Any thoughts on premium VOD window to try to offset any of the sort of implications around restricted \u2013 restrictions at the theatrical in the coming months?\nBob Chapek: Yes. So we very much believe in the value of the theatrical experience overall to launch blockbuster movies. As you know, we had 7 $1 billion films in calendar year \u201819. But we also realize that either because of changing and evolving consumer dynamics or because of certain situations like COVID, we may have to make some changes to that overall strategy just because theaters aren\u2019t open or aren\u2019t open to the extent that anybody needs to be financially viable. So we\u2019re going to evaluate each one of our movies on a case-by-case situation as we are doing right now during this coronavirus situation. I think you know that Artemis Fowl is moving over to Disney+ given the demographics of appeal of that film, which was not originally the plan. And \u2013 but all our other Temple movies have been rescheduled theatrically for later in the year. So we very much believe in the power of that launch platform for our big movies.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thank you very much. And then just lastly masks for guests and or employees in Shanghai?\nBob Chapek: Yes, in terms of Shanghai it\u2019s going to be masks for guests and employees. The only characters that will not wear masks are the face characters and they\u2019ll be at a distance from crowds.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thank you all.\nLowell Singer: Doug, thank you. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Hi, thank you. Hope everybody is okay. Two questions. One\u2026\nLowell Singer: Jessica, you could speak up a little bit, please.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Sure. The first question is how are you thinking about longer-term changes in your business model as a result of this crisis? And however you think about that whether it\u2019s sports, how much you will bid or how many contracts you need or conversely is this an opportunity versus competitors, CapEx, resizing the business etcetera? And second question is can you remind us what percent pre-crisis cruise ships were in terms of revenue and operating income? And since this seems like the last business that will come back, can you cancel the orders for your pending ships that are being built?\nLowell Singer: Okay. So I\u2019ll turn the business model question over to Bob Chapek. And then I think he and Christine can address the cruise question.\nBob Chapek: Okay. In terms of the future rides and the business models, we think that live sports remain incredibly valuable to us and we continue to have an interest in live sports rights given the unique slate of assets that we own with ESPN, ESPN+ and ABC. And we\u2019re going to do that, though, as we always have done in a very disciplined manner. Existing consumer trends play a real big part on how we think about the value of sports rights as they make the transition from linear over to digital. And I think it really \u2013 it\u2019s a bit premature to give any specific details on what the strategy is other than we\u2019re obviously highly interested in those and we think we want to make the evolution along with the consumer as they go from linear to digital. In terms of the CapEx question, obviously we had a lot of really big plans in the parks and we still continue to have big plans. Those good ideas before COVID are going to be really good ideas after. And as Christine said in her opening remarks, there are certain trimmings that we\u2019re doing here and there to be responsible from a financial standpoint, but we have such great intellectual property and our Imagineers over at our theme over at our theme parks where the majority of our capital goes have done such a tremendous job of planning out future experiences for our guests that we\u2019re just going to go ahead and take a slightly finer-tooth comb, if you will, through those expenditures but essentially plan on investing behind those businesses like we always have. And in terms of the cruise ship business, we agree that that will probably be the last of our travel oriented businesses to come back online. Interestingly enough long term all of our data and our research shows that our guests will be just as interested in cruising with us long term. Obviously not in the next few months but much more resilient than any of the competitive businesses because of that love for Disney and assurance that they feel, that they trust our business to act in a responsible way to help to the extent possible protect them against some of the woes that have plagued the industry since COVID has hit.\nLowell Singer: Christine, do you want to just talk about the cruise component of that segment?\nChristine McCarthy: Sure. Jessica we don\u2019t break down our individual businesses within the segment, but \u2013 so for the percent of revenue and operating income, given the size of our global parks business that includes the cruise business and now it includes consumer products. It\u2019s a relatively small percentage of operating income and revenue. But that being said and this just builds on some of the things Bob said, this is a business that is one of our highest rated businesses in terms of guest satisfaction and it also has a very high intent to repeat the experience. So a lot of people who go on one tend to go back for multiple cruises. So \u2013 and it\u2019s also a business when we look at it from an ROI perspective, ROIC perspective, it\u2019s a very nice returning business creating value long term for shareholders.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Jessica thanks for the questions. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. I have two. One is, I wonder, for Bob Chapek. How do you staff the parks in anticipation of an opening? What signals do you look for and what drives your optimization? Is it the number of basically the experience you want to have measure up to a park at full opening? So any type of signals, any type of history you have to staff up in anticipation of an opening. That\u2019s one. And then two for Christine, in answering Ben\u2019s question you were helpful in giving us the impact from COVID, but then you guys furloughed employees in April. So how would that answer change furloughed employee world. So how much of the cost base becomes variable post the furloughs? So those are my questions.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thank you for the questions. Bob Chapek, do you want to start with the first one?\nBob Chapek: Yes, in terms of the signals we look for park opening, our hypothesis is because of pent-up demand that if we open up at something less than 50% of our standard capacity that we\u2019re probably not going to have trouble filling that. So whatever level we save that at , whether it\u2019s 10%, 25% or 50% of typical crowds, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be able to have at our park. Therefore we will staff accordingly to that type of level, whatever that level will be eventually. In terms of optimization and sort of how we\u2019ll approach that, obviously labor is a huge component of our cost base and so that will slide with the attendance. And that\u2019s why I said when we\u2019re looking at the decisions for what that level would be inside the parks and what we\u2019re going to be targeting for, it\u2019s really looked at as a contribution to net contribution and profit as opposed to saying that we\u2019re going to sort of cover the entire or not. Therefore, that gives us the ability to make our decisions on a variable basis and keep as much of that cost structure variable as possible. Obviously, we\u2019ll practice a yield strategy overall just like we always have.\nMichael Nathanson: Okay.\nLowell Singer: And, Christine, do you want to take the second question?\nChristine McCarthy: Sure. Hi, Michael.\nMichael Nathanson: Hi, Christine.\nChristine McCarthy: On the furloughed employees, so the impact that we saw on our parks full segment for Q2 included fully paying everybody. We continued to do that until early April when we did furlough companywide over 100,000 employees. But most of those employees were in the park segment by just the sheer numbers. So while they are furloughed, we are still paying their portion of their medical benefits. So they\u2019re not out of pocket or any of their benefits. We thought that was very, very important to do. And when we think about our costs too for the parks, we think about it as three levels. There is the fixed component, which is depreciation, taxes, property taxes and insurance. The big chunk of that depreciation is a non-cash item. The other two, obviously are cash items. Then you have the variable costs and those are cost of goods sold and that\u2019s where you do have significant flexibility pretty early on the time curve. And then there is another chunk of costs where we would put in labor and that is what we call semi-fixed and they are fixed in the short term, just looking at how long it took to do what we had to do to furlough employees, once again we are not \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t have done it until we had more information that indicated that the parks will be closed for not just a couple of weeks, but we\u2019re now into months. And it also include \u2013 then we have more variable costs in that semi-fixed. And that includes the labor, also SG&A. So we\u2019ve been taking measures there to eliminate whatever costs we can and other operating expenses. So the furloughed employees will benefit Q3, but we\u2019ve also done things in the SG&A area that we believe are appropriate given the current state of being closed.\nLowell Singer: Hey, thanks for the questions. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nSteven Cahall: Yes, thank you. Just wanted to follow-up on parks question and talk a little bit about how you\u2019re thinking about contingency plans and sort of brand safety. I imagine if you opened it far below attendance as you talked about, you would have a lot of pent-up demand and then you kind of got to decide who gets to come in and what the screening measures are and it seems like a whole Pandora\u2019s Box, I am just wondering about your willingness to sort of wait into that today versus waiting for a vaccine? And then second on Hulu, kind of modest sequential growth in the live product, but ARPU was up a lot. Could you help us think about how much of that was the pricing versus the ad ARPU or the subscription versus the ad ARPU and how are you thinking about driving both subs and ARPU on that product going forward? Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Bob Chapek will take the first question about parks and then I will ask Christine to take the Hulu question.\nBob Chapek: Okay. In terms of sort of contingency plans going forward, one of the ways that we are going to deal with this situation in Shanghai and that\u2019s no promise that we will deal with that the same way domestically, but is through dated tickets, so that you don\u2019t have a whole bunch of people showing up at your gates and then finding out that we have reached our limit by 9:00 a.m. and then they go back disappointed. So we are very conscious of that particular oversubscription, if you will, relative to demand that we are going to have. And so we will handle that through either dated ticketing or something very similar.\nChristine McCarthy: And on the Hulu ARPU, Steve, I think you\u2019re really looking at the live TV ARPU. That was up 29% year-over-year and that was because we took a price increase in the quarter and that\u2019s reflected in that 29% increase. It\u2019s roughly $15 per sub. On the SVOD product, it actually declined a little bit year-over-year. But the one thing I would mention there is, there is some seasonality to advertising on Hulu and coming out of the holiday period which is our first quarter that\u2019s what is reflected in the SVOD number.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Your line is now open.\nJason Bazinet: I just have two questions from the Q. One was your decision to continue to pay the sports rights owners even though there aren\u2019t sports, if you could just elaborate on that and how long that could endure if sports don\u2019t come back soon? And then the second one is on the dividend, can you just provide a little bit of color in terms of how you\u2019re thinking, what are the major swing factors in terms of not potentially paying dividend beyond just the one dividend that you\u2019ve decided not to pay? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: Thank you, Jason. I will ask Christine to take both of those questions, so paying on sports rights and dividend.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, Jason. And I am impressed that you are already into the 10-Q. On cash payments paying to the leagues, we are not going to get into discussing the specifics of our various agreements. But what I can tell you is that we are working very, very closely with the leagues and the conference partners and we are looking forward to the return of live events. And we are just \u2013 are in active discussions with them now. So I will just leave it at that. And on the dividend, really these are always very, very tough decisions. But we made a decision for this quarter. We don\u2019t have a crystal ball that allows us to see into the future for how long this disruption is going to keep our businesses closed partially or fully. So we will address the dividend again in the next 6 months.\nJason Bazinet: Okay, very helpful. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Jason thanks for the questions. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Your line is now open.\nJohn Hodulik: Hey, great. Thanks. Maybe two quick follow-ups on the park and then a second question. First, can you tell us what the capacity limitations are on the Shanghai park when you guys open up next week? Number two, anything you can tell us about U.S. parks attendance in terms of what percentage of typical attendees say in 2019 drove versus flew, trying to get a sense for how many of the visitors are local versus from say out of state? And then second question is there anything you could tell us on sort of ad revenue trends in April or thus far in May that would be great? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thank you, John. Bob, do you want to take the parks questions and then Christine, do you want to take the ad trends question?\nBob Chapek: Sure. You got it. In terms of Shanghai Disney Resort, our capacity tends to be 80,000 a day. The government is putting a limit on that. Roughly they want us to be at about 30% of that. So it\u2019s 24,000 a day. We\u2019re going to actually open up far below that just to have our training wheels on with our new procedures and processes to make sure we don\u2019t have any lines backing up either as guests entering into the park or as they wade through the park. So we\u2019re going to approach that very, very slowly. But after a few weeks we will actually be up to what the government\u2019s guideline is and at that point there could be some lifting of even those restrictions of the 30%. So those are the metrics there. In terms of U.S. park attendees, it really depends on which part you\u2019re talking about. Obviously, the Anaheim Park has much more of a drive-in market and lot less folks that stay overnight a lot less guests that stay overnight where Orlando has a big predominance of folks that actually \u2013 families that actually fly in to go visit there, but we have a fairly robust annual pass program at both parks and a big drive-in market as well, but it\u2019s significantly different in terms of the overnight guests and those that might fly in Orlando.\nJohn Hodulik: Got it.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, John. And to answer your question on ad revenue, obviously this whole COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our ad sales. I think that\u2019s fair to say for anyone in the advertising business on one side or the other. And it\u2019s really due \u2013 for us, due to the lack of live sporting events and the pullback from advertisers in categories that are most impacted. So we have seen declines in demand from industries like movie studios, restaurants, travel, tourism, retail, domestic auto, those are all the things that have \u2013 we are seeing pullbacks in. But on the other hand, we\u2019ve seen some advertisers opportunistically increasing their spend and some of those industry groups are things like financial services, tech, telecom, the DTC or streaming services and also consumer packaged goods. When you net out all of that, the net impact is what we are expecting as a significant decline in ad sales. And we will see it more at ESPN because of the lack of live sporting events than we will at the broadcast network.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Thanks, Christine.\nLowell Singer: John, thank you. Operator, I think we will take one more question today.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from John Janedis with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nJohn Janedis: Thank you. Maybe one quick one, you spoke to live sports and the hope that we will start to see sports come back over the next couple of months. Depending on timing, there could be, I guess a lot hitting in the fourth quarter and at the same time there may not be a lot of scripted programming from prime time. So can you talk about your ability to maybe air some of the content that would traditionally be on ESPN on ABC and how are you thinking about the fall or winter season in terms of programming? And then maybe Christine a quick one as a follow-up to John, can you give us any kind of order of magnitude in terms of maybe sports relative to non-sports on advertising?\nLowell Singer: Hey, John. Thanks for the questions and welcome back.\nJohn Janedis: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Bob Chapek, do you want to take the first one and then we will turn it over to Christine?\nBob Chapek: I think if our executives over at ESPN and ABC have shown anything over the last two months it\u2019s the fact that they can be nimble and be very creative at being nimble. So in terms of being able to toggle between one outlet and another whether it\u2019s between ABC to ESPN or ESPN to ABC or ESPN to ESPN+, as you know we\u2019ve made quite a number of changes given the changes in the environment. And I suspect that we would be able to do that same toggling going forward into the future, depending on what happens in terms of what sports come back, how they come back and look at everything essentially through the lens of our guests and our consumers and how they want to enjoy and how they can enjoy. I also point out to the fact that the NFL Draft was such an unbelievable success for us and that is a perfect example of being nimble. We had over three nights, over 15 million households which is obviously a huge increase and I think that speaks volumes to the fact that our cast and our executives over those networks do a phenomenal job of being able to adjust on the play.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, John. And on your question about the order of magnitude of sports versus non-sports for ad sales declines, as you may remember we combined our ad sales into one unit back in 2018 and we are now \u2013 we have one group who sells across the Media Networks segment. So, we haven\u2019t really \u2013 and we don\u2019t really intend to break out sports versus non-sports. However, it is fair to say that sports, i.e., ESPN is being more significantly impacted and that is you can do the math around that with your expectations, but there\u2019s definitely more ad sales decline year-over-year hitting ESPN.\nJohn Janedis: Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer: Okay, thanks. Yes. Thank you, John. Thanks for the questions and thanks again everyone for joining us today. Note that a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that were referred to on this call to equivalent GAAP measures can be found on our Investor Relations website. Also later today, we will post to our IR website a document that includes more information about our treatment of inter-segment content transactions. In our remarks we provided estimates of the performance of certain 21CF assets in periods of the prior year. These estimates are based on an analysis of 21CF records, but are nonetheless unaudited estimates and are not precise measures of historical results before the acquisition. Let me also remind you that certain statements on this call, including financial estimates or statements about our plans, expectations or beliefs may constitute forward-looking statements under the securities laws. We make these statements on the basis of our views and assumptions regarding future events and business performance at the time we make them and we do not undertake any obligations to update these states.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nLowell Singer: Good afternoon and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's first quarter 2020 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and the webcast and a transcript will also be available on our website. Joining me for today's call are, Bob Iger, Disney's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we will of course be happy to take your questions. So with that let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nRobert Iger: Thanks Low, and good afternoon everyone. We've had a great quarter and a very productive start to the year, but before I talk about the quarter, let me begin with the events in Asia related to the Coronavirus. Certainly our hearts go out to all those affected by this devastating outbreak, including the thousands of people who work for us in the region. In line with numerous prevention efforts taking place across China, we've temporarily closed our parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong, and we will continue to closely monitor this public health crisis. Christine will have details about the developing financial impact in her comments. Turning to the quarter, since our last call, our studio released two more films that exceeded $1 billion each at the global Box Office. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, which concluded the nine episode Skywalker saga; and Frozen 2 which became the highest-grossing animated movie of all time with more than $1.4 billion in global sales, surpassing the original Frozen, which held the record since 2014. The Rise of Skywalker and Frozen 2 along with Captain Marvel, Aladdin, The Lion King, Toy Story 4, and the biggest movie of all time, Avengers: Endgame contributed to a total global Box Office for the year for Disney of more than $11 billion, shattering the previous industry record of $7.6 billion set by us in 2016. Many of these films are already available exclusively on Disney+, and the remainder will soon join the service following their home entertainment window. On the parks side, we're thrilled by the overwhelming response to our newest attraction Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance, which opened in Orlando in early December, and in Anaheim just a few weeks ago. Our Imagineers and the Design Team at Lucasfilm did an absolutely phenomenal job, and it's one of the most immersive, ambitious, and technologically advanced attractions ever created for a Disney park, and it's elevating storytelling to exciting new levels. Not surprising, Rise of the Resistance has quickly become a fan favorite at both parks and Galaxy's Edge has been a great success at Disneyland and Walt Disney World. Of course, the high point of the quarter was the highly anticipated launch of our streaming service, Disney+. Thanks in large part to our incredible portfolio of great brands, the outstanding content from our creative engines and a robust technology platform, the launch of Disney+ has been enormously successful exceeding even our greatest expectations. As we reported previously, we had more than 10 million sign-ups for Disney+ by the end of day 1, and we ended the quarter with 26.5 million paid subscribers. Since then, consumers have continued to sign up for the service directly at disneyplus.com through Verizon, which offers a free year of Disney+ to many of its customers at no additional cost, as well as through other distributors including Apple, Google, LG, Microsoft, Samsung, Sony, and Roku. We recognize there's a lot of interest in this new business, and we wanted to give you some additional context. So, I'm pleased to say that as of Monday, we were at 28.6 million paid subscribers. Going forward, it's our intention to announce subs as of the end of the quarter that we're reporting on. One additional note on sign-ups for Disney+, although we will not provide specifics, is that we are pleased to report that both conversion from free to pay and churn rates were better than we expected. We believe the subscriber growth to-date and the overall reaction to Disney+ reflects a variety of factors that include the uniqueness of the service and excellent user interface, and the high quality of our brands and content. In fact, we are seeing the four-quadrant appeal of our brands reflected in our subscriber numbers as well. On the content side, consumers have enthusiastically embraced the exceptional offering of classic movies and shorts from our studio, including Moana and Frozen. Disney Channel series like Hannah Montana and The Suite Life of Zack & Cody, recent theatrical releases like The Lion King, which became available on the service on January 28. The Simpsons is also quite popular with all 30 previous seasons available. And our growing slate of original content is also of great interest to our subscribers, especially The Mandalorian which has quickly become a bonafide hit and a cultural phenomenon. Of course, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention a certain child in The Mandalorian, who has taken the world by storm. I do believe the sensational response to this new character says so much about Disney+ and our company's ability to connect with audiences. We know there is great anticipation for the substantial array of Baby Yoda consumer products hitting the market in the coming months. We'll continue to add high quality content as a service that includes Frozen 2, and Episode 9, The Rise of Skywalker. Many of you probably saw our Super Bowl spot featuring three original new Marvel series for Disney+. Loki, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, which will premiere on the service in August, and WandaVision, which will debut in December. These same characters and actors from the Marvel cinematic universe along with events from these new shows will factor into future Marvel films as we integrate storytelling across these platforms, all under the Marvel Studio banner. We also have the highly anticipated return of The Mandalorian in October and multiple new series from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and Nat Geo. So, there's a lot to look forward to. Although our volume will increase, we remain focused on providing quality content from our core franchises and brands, not just quantity as we continue to build our portfolio. And the creative community has taken notice as well, many have expressed interest in joining Disney+\u2019s roster of extraordinary talent. The next big priority is launching Disney+ in numerous international markets, starting in Western Europe on March 24 when we will launch in the U.K. and Ireland, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, and Austria. Additional markets including Belgium, the Nordics, and Portugal will follow this summer. In December, we signed a deal with Canal+, the leading pay-TV provider in France. We're currently in talks with several other potential distribution partners throughout the region. We're also excited to announce that we will be launching Disney+ in India through our Hotstar service on March 29, at the beginning of the Indian Premier League Cricket season. We will be rebranding our existing Hotstar VIP and Premium subscription tiers to Disney+ Hotstar. We see this as a great opportunity to use the proven platform of Hotstar to launch the new Disney+ service in one of the most populous countries and fastest-growing economies in the world. Looking across our portfolio of Direct-to-Consumer businesses, we're also pleased with the growth of ESPN plus. We ended the quarter with 6.6 million paid subscribers, and as of Monday, we were at 7.6 million. We've been especially happy with a number of partnerships, particularly with the UFC and the recent McGregor Ceron fight brought in about a 1 million pay-per-view purchases and a 0.5 million new subscribers. We will continue to add content to the service on an opportunistic basis. At Hulu, we recently announced that we will be reorganizing the business to more closely integrat it into our Direct-to-Consumer segment in order to operate more efficiently and effectively as we look to expand our domestic consumer base, as well as our presence outside the U.S. With respect to subscriber numbers, we remain optimistic about the future of the service. Hulu ended the quarter with 30.4 million paid subs and as of Monday, the number was 30.7 million. During our last earnings call, we announced the launch of FX on Hulu, which will be available to all Hulu subscribers at no additional cost. Beginning next month, Hulu will be the exclusive streaming service for all new FX Original programming. FX on Hulu will also offer in-season streaming as well as back seasons for most current and library series. We view this as a fantastic opportunity to expose FX as exceptional content to a broader audience, while also making available to consumers in new ways. We believe there is tremendous appetite for our content and the goal of FX on Hulu is to expand our reach to include those viewers who are not linear pay TV subscribers, and that includes many of Hulu's young and highly engaged streaming audience. The addition of FX as programming is a step in the direction of continued increased investment in high quality programing for Hulu, which will be developed and produced by our existing creative engines. It's all been challenging for a company to pivot in a new strategic direction particularly when it involves navigating between established and emerging business models, but since we announced our intention to shift our strategy, we have made an extraordinary amount of progress. This included a strategic reorganization of our Company, creating a Direct-to-Consumer & International segment. We believe the new structure would better position our businesses for the future and now that we've completed the reorganization and launched Disney+, are more confident than ever in that decision. I am enormously proud of what we have accomplished in a relatively short period of time and believe we are now well positioned to not only withstand the disruptive forces of technology but thrive in today's increasingly dynamic media environment. And with that, I will turn the call over to Christine to talk more about our performance in the quarter, and then I'll be back to take your questions.\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks Bob, and good afternoon everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter were $1.53. Fiscal 2020 is off to a good start, as evidenced by our first quarter results, and as Bob discussed, we are incredibly pleased with the launch of Disney+ and the positive consumer response we have received to-date. In terms of our fiscal first quarter results, our Studios creative momentum continues to deliver outstanding financial performance. Operating income was up significantly compared to Q1 last year, driven by growth and worldwide theatrical and higher TVs SVOD distribution results at our legacy film studio. The actual results reflect the performance of Frozen 2 and Star Wars: The Rise of SkyWalker in the quarter compared to theatrical releases last year, which included Ralph Breaks the Internet, Mary Poppins Returns and The Nutcracker. Higher legacy TV SVOD results were driven by content sales to Disney+, partially offset by a decrease in sales to third parties. The increases in our legacy theatrical and TV SVOD businesses were partially offset by a $50 million loss at the 21CF studio business, as operating income from TV SVOD distribution was more than offset by an operating loss at Worldwide Theatrical, and general and administrative costs. At Parks, Experiences and Products, operating income was up 9% in the quarter, driven by higher results at Consumer Products and at our domestic Parks and Resorts, partially offset by lower results at our international Parks and Resorts. Consumer Products operating income was up 25% due to growth in merchandise licensing as a result of strong revenue growth from sales of Frozen and Star Wars merchandise, both of which benefited from theatrical releases in the quarter. Revenue at domestic Parks and Experiences was up an impressive 10% in the quarter, driven by higher guest spending and to a lesser extent increases in attendance at our domestic Parks and Resorts. Operating income at domestic Parks and Experiences was up 6% as the flow through from strong revenue growth was dampened by operational expenses associated with Galaxy's Edge and significant labor expense growth due to higher wages as a result of collective bargaining agreements. Attendance at our domestic Parks was up 2% in the first quarter and per capita guest spending was up 10% on higher admissions, merchandise and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 4%, and occupancy was 92%. So far this quarter domestic resort reservations are pacing up 4% compared to this time last year, and book rates at our domestic hotels are currently pacing up 10%. At our International Operations, operating income was lower in Q1 as improved results at Shanghai Disney Resort were more than offset by a decline of about $80 million at Hong Kong Disneyland due to lower attendance and hotel occupancy. Hong Kong Disneyland results in the quarter are consistent with the outlook we communicated last quarter. However, the recent closure of our parks in both Shanghai and Hong Kong, due to the ongoing Corona virus situation will negatively impact second quarter and full year results. The current closure is taking place during the quarter in which we typically see strong attendance and occupancy levels due to the timing of the Chinese New Year holiday. The precise magnitude of the financial impact is highly dependent on the duration of the closures and how quickly we can resume normal operations. At Shanghai Disney Resort, we currently estimate the closure of the park could have an adverse impact to second quarter operating income of approximately $135 million, assuming the park is closed for two months during Q2. At Hong Kong Disneyland, we currently estimate the closure of the park could have an additional adverse impact to operating income of about $40 million for the second quarter. As I discussed last quarter, we were already seeing a significant decrease in visitation to Hong Kong Disneyland from China, and other parts of Asia. So in aggregate, we estimate these two factors could result in a decline in Hong Kong Disneyland's Operating income of about $145 million for the second quarter. Again, this assumes the resort is closed for two months. Turning to Media Networks, Operating income was up in the first quarter due to increases at both Cable and Broadcasting. Higher cable results reflect the consolidation of the 21CF cable businesses, partially offset by a decrease at ESPN. At ESPN, growth in affiliate revenue was more than offset by higher programming and production costs, primarily driven by contractual rate increases at NFL, college football and the launch of the ACC Network in addition to lower ad revenue. ESPN's domestic linear advertising revenue was down 4.5% in the first quarter due to lower average viewership primarily for NBA and college football regular-season games, which more than offset an increase in viewership from Monday night football. On note, that when you look at ad revenue across all ESPN domestic ad platforms, which include digital and addressable advertising revenue reported in our DTCI segment, ESPN's total domestic ad revenue in the first quarter was roughly comparable to the prior year. So far this quarter, ESPN's domestic linear cash ad sales are pacing up 2% compared to last year. At Broadcasting, higher results in the quarter were due to the consolidation of 21CF and a benefit from new accounting guidance which is explained further in our press release and 10-Q filings, partially offset by lower results from our legacy operations. Results at our legacy Broadcasting operations were lower in the quarter as higher affiliate revenue was more than offset by lower ad revenue, a difficult program sales comp at ABC Studios and higher network programming and production costs. Lower program sales at ABC Studios reflect the prior year sale of Marvel's The Punisher, during Q1 last year and no comparable sale in the first quarter this year. Total Broadcasting ad revenue was lower in the quarter, driven by lower political advertising at our owned stations and a decline at the ABC Network. Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 19% and reflects the consolidation of 21CF and growth at both cable and broadcasting. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by 14 points of growth from the acquisition of 21CF and 7 points from higher rates, partially offset by a 2-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers which was aided by about a 2.5 point benefit from the launch of the ACC Network. Operating losses at our Direct-to-Consumer and International segment increased in the quarter driven by cost incurred to support the successful launch of Disney+, the consolidation of an operating loss at Hulu, and higher programing costs at ESPN Plus. These operating losses were partially offset by the consolidation of the 21CF international cable businesses. Results at our Direct-to-Consumer businesses had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of $845 million, which was in line with the guidance we provided last quarter. We expect our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment to generate about $900 million in operating losses for the second quarter and we expect the continued investment in our DTC services, specifically Disney+, which will launch in a number of European markets late in the second quarter, and the consolidation of Hulu to drive an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income of our DTC businesses of approximately $520 million. As Bob mentioned, Disney+ had 28.6 million paid subscribers as of yesterday, an increase of 2.1 million since the end of the first quarter. In the near-term, we expect subscriber growth to come primarily from outside the U.S., with the next meaningful phase of domestic subscriber growth likely to coincide with the release later this calendar year of highly anticipated original content, including episodic series from Marvel and Season 2 of The Mandalorian. Turning to the elimination segment, revenue and profit eliminations were significantly higher in Q1, driven primarily by the inter-segment content sales from the Studio and Media Networks to DTCI. I'll note that our 10-Q this quarter contains additional detail on the general structure and accounting treatment of the various types of inter-segment content transactions reflected in our segment results. Lastly, we continue to make progress on realizing the value of the 21CF acquisition. The businesses we acquired, excluding 21CF's stake in Hulu and net of inter-segment eliminations, contributed approximately $590 million in segment operating income in the first quarter. Consolidating Hulu's operating losses and netting out inter-segment eliminations, resulted in a positive impact total segment operating income of about $300 million. We estimate the acquisition of 21CF, and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu had a total dilutive impact on our Q1 EPS before purchase accounting of $0.27 per share, and we estimate the acquisition of 21st Century Fox in the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu will have a dilutive impact on our Q2 earnings per share before purchase accounting of about $0.25 per share. We are still on track for the acquisition to be accretive to EPS before purchase accounting for fiscal 2021. I'll now turn the call over to Lowell, and we would be happy to (multiple speakers) take your questions.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks, Christine. And operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks, Bob. I have 2Q and Disney+. First one is stepping back a bit, what were the biggest surprises or learnings that you had post-launch. When you looked at what you had accomplished, and then after those learnings, how did you or what have you adjusted in terms of your launch plans or content spending plans after reviewing the first two months of this product?\nRobert Iger: Well, I don't know if you call this a surprise, but certainly it's a learning because we didn't know until we launched. But we've been heartened by the fact that there has been basically consumption of a broad array of product across all of our brands. That is not just about original programming or not just about the Disney library, it's really about everything including original shorts and older shorts, and legacy Disney Channel shows and of course, the library led by musicals and recent theatrical releases and Mandalorian, but it has been very broad-based, and I mentioned earlier that about, it was, 65% of the people who watch Mandalorian, watch at least 10 other things on the service, so this was not about any one thing. 50% of people who use the service have watched movies as a -- for instance. So, with that in mind, we feel that validates the collection of those brands and a blend of product that includes obviously, the library or legacy TV and films of short-form and long-form, and then original programming. The trajectory in terms of our investment in original programming on the service is roughly the same as it would have been whereas it was before we launched. We haven't really changed that that much. Clearly, the original shows that we decide to invest and led by the Mandalorian have worked, and we knew when we launched that we were launching with a modest amount of original programming, and that it would build over time. So, as we look ahead, we're really comfortable with the volume that -- of the product that we are creating and don't really feel that there is much that we have to adjust to right now. We have just as a - for instance, we have a few Star Wars series in varying stages of production and development. We have the three Marvel series that were announced and I think there are seven other Marvel series that are in varying stages of development or pre-production, and there are a number of Disney originals. We have Disney original movies coming. Very pleased with them, by the way, and then we have a new one coming, Timmy Failure is a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, for instance. So we've got a - I think a great blend and don't feel a real need to adjust, and I think the best thing about it all is that the decision that we made to go with quality and not just volume is working. So, the second part of the question?\nMichael Nathanson: Okay, that was covered\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: One more question on Direct-to-Consumer and then NFL. On Hulu, could you - Bob, you said you're going to take it internationally, you've alluded to that before. How long will it take you to get some of these rights back around the globe, and can you give us any thoughts on timing because the bundle strategy is obviously working here. And then on NFL, can you give us an update on your thoughts on that in terms of - well if anything you can timing, but also placement of NFL on ABC versus ESPN, and ESPN Plus?\nRobert Iger: We are working up a plan to take Hulu internationally. We actually have a lot of specifics around it, but we've decided that the priority needs to be Disney+. We are launching, as I mentioned on the call across multiple territories in Western Europe later in March, and then in India on March 29 and it's going to continue to roll out across the world going into 2021 including Latin America, and we feel that we need to concentrate on those launches in the marketing and the creation of product for those, and then come in with Hulu right after or soon after that. So, we don't have specifics, except we do plan to begin rolling Hulu out, I'd say probably in 2021 internationally that is after the Disney+ launch. On the NFL side, look, it's very early to speculate. I think the ratings for the NFL suggest that, while there's a lot of disruption and there is a fair amount of erosion and you see people basically watching programs from multiple new sources and creating more competition for the traditional linear networks. The live sports has held up really well, led of course by the NFL. So, our interest in the NFL remains very strong and there have been only preliminary discussions and nothing more, and it would be premature for me to give you any more detail.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBen Swinburne: Bob, there's a lot of discussion in the market about the relative popularity of Disney's brands and IP outside the U.S. versus inside the U.S., and obviously we're all going to now digest the results you just reported. But how do you think we should be thinking about the subscriber opportunity as you launch these new markets in the March quarter in Europe relative to what we've seen so far in the U.S., and what can you tell us about the India launch, and how you plan to price that and bundle it with Hotstar VIP? How big is Hotstar VIP? Can you just talk about the go-to-market in India since that's a market where you're going in with a really unique strategic position given the Star business?\nRobert Iger: Well, first of all, those brands are global brands, each one of them, including Star Wars, which maybe what you're alluding to Ben. They have varying strengths in different markets, Disney is probably the strongest on a consistent basis across the world, but they all have raised brand affinity and brand interest in all of them, which I think is one of the things that is a strong selling point for us into markets. So, I don't really think that, well, we necessarily need to do much adjusting as it relates to the product that has been designed for the U.S. except to make sure, obviously, that the programs are dubbed in the local language properly and are high quality. And secondly, that we have enough local programming, either to meet local quotas or simply to address local cases. One of the interesting things by the way about Star Wars and The Mandalorian, because there has been some things written after The Rise of Skywalker, that the popularity of Star Wars in certain international markets where there's Star Wars and certainly in - and international markets has never caught on. One of the reasons for that is that there isn't a Star Wars legacy in many of these markets, China being a main one, where people didn't grow up on that franchise or that brand. So when they tuned into, or heard about the Skywalker legacy, there was too much that had already gone in the past that was not familiar to them and they didn't really want to get on board late. That's not true with Mandalorian, because Mandalorian is even though it's based on, obviously, certain Star Wars elements, characters in places, you don't have to know anything about the history of Star Wars in terms of an access point or in terms of your interest. So anyway, we feel great about the popularity of our brands. Interesting the Disney brand globally has never been more popular. The other thing I want to say is that the brand studies that we've seen or brand research that we've seen in the United States suggests that interest and affinity in the Disney Brand has actually risen nicely, thanks to Disney+ particularly among young people. I think a lot of that has to do with the relevance of the platform, the technology, the manner of presentation. I think it's a loud statement about what's going on in the world today in terms of consumer tastes, particularly young people, which is why the demographics of Hulu were substantially younger than the demographics on some of our peers in the linear networks, et cetera, et cetera. In India, we're going to launch bundled with Hotstar directly bundled meaning it's Disney+ Hotstar as a product. We're not giving specifics about price at this point, but expect that there'll be two primary products brought into India. One will be more premium in nature that will include the entire library, so with the original programming and the other one will be more basic that will have the library and not the original programming. Priced for the market and launched at a very peak period of time, so the IPL, the Cricket League. And so, we think it's an opportune moment, we take advantage of the presence of Star in the market and the millions of subscribers that they also have, we take advantage of the sports tie-in, and we use the interface and the technology that includes the billing that already exists to launch a service, we believe, under very, very optimal circumstances.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAlexia Quadrani: Just following up on your color or your commentary on Disney+. Is there any more you can share with us in terms of what the - where the subscribers came from meaning and sort of like what type of subscriber they are, meaning like how many maybe a year-long or multi-year subscriber deal versus month-to-month, and sort of how many sort of came in for use versus on wholesale partnerships like Verizon and such. I don't know how much color you can share there? And then my second question is just on the studio, where you've had just incredible success there and another record year,'19, I guess your conduct - your conviction of that success can continue, especially when you're taking account kind of pipeline now from the Fox Studios?\nRobert Iger: First of all, regarding Disney+, and the fact that the ARPU by the end of the quarter was $5.56 on a $6.99 subscription suggests that while there were discounts in the market in the packaging that existed enabled consumers to buy in at lower prices. We did extremely well, basically with the Direct-to-Consumer Package, and ARPU that was higher and so the 26.5 million and subscribers came roughly 50% directly through Disneyplus.com, for instance, where not only weren't we revenue sharing with others, but a lot of those subscribers, or many of them may have bought a year-long service or even a three-year, many of them bought basically the month for the full - for the full price. About 20% of those subscribers came from Verizon, and the rest came from the variety of other services, that is stripping the app, and including the iTunes platform. So we were actually very pleased with the diversity of, basically, routes that people took to get to us and extremely pleased with the ARPU. Now also understand that the vast majority came from domestic because we only launched in a couple of territories, Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands and Canada with this, and so, these are mostly domestic subs. But, I think it's all very, very positive story in terms of the - the manner in which people bought this and as I said earlier, the ARPU. And the other thing that we noted that was that the bundle with ESPN and with Hulu was very helpful in terms of lowering churn rates. And as I said, in my remarks, both the conversion from free-to-pay, as well as the churn rates were much better than we expected they would be - much better than we had estimated they would be before we launched. And I think, again, that's the result of - that starts with the product and I think the end of - the user interface also got incredibly high marks in terms of the ease of use, the easy navigation, the quality of the product, the value of the brands and the price point which we can't ignore, a very accessible price point, priced purposely because of the brand and our desire to be as accessible as possible on a broad basis. Regarding the studio, look, a $11 billion plus Box Office year from the Disney studio alone is not something we're likely to repeat right away, but as we look ahead, we're extremely pleased with the long-term prospects for our studio and the slate. I could name a number of titles, but this year, for instance, we have to Pixar titles with Onward and Soul in the marketplace. We've got a couple of really strong Disney branded Jungle Cruise and Mulan. We have obviously Marvel with Black Widow, initial at first, and then Eternals at the rest of the - at the end of the year and you can imagine, a lot of development from all of those. On the Star Wars front, were it - as I had mentioned in previous calls, we're taking a bit of a hiatus in terms of theatrical release, we finished the nine-episode Skywalker Saga, and we're developing both television and features. The priority in the next few years is television with The Mandalorian Season 2 coming in October, and then more coming from The Mandalorian thereafter, including the possibility of infusing it with more characters and the possibility of taking those characters in their own direction in terms of series. And then, we have a prequel to Rogue One in an Obi Wan series, also in development. So the priority for Star Wars in the short-term is going to be, I'll call it television for Disney+, and then we will have more to say about development of theatrical soon after that. But 2020 is not going to be the same as 2019 for the studio. But as we still expect a very strong year, and given the franchises and the talent that we both work with, and have working for us, we are confident that the studio is going to continue to be a strong driver of operating income for the company, both on the movie front, but also as a great supplier of product both original and secondary market for Disney+ and for Hulu, by the way.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Your line is now open.\nJohn Hodulik: Bob, couple of questions, follow-ups on the DTC business. First of all, on Disney+, the model definitely, it seems to be holding up, you talked about, ARPU churn, content spend, the target is for 60 million to 90 million subs, and 24 million in profitability, because of this, we're halfway to the goals, in the model, the metrics seem to be hitting. Can we expect the profitability to come in sooner than the 24 million number? And then, if we just focus on the U.S., I think you guys gave guidance for 20 million to 30 million subs in the U.S., and again, you're sort of at the high-end, or around the high-end of that guidance. What are you seeing in terms of the TAM, are you just - is the TAM bigger than you thought and could that potentially be the case in the rest of world or are you just - just penetrating the market - as we then thought?\nRobert Iger: I think, John, you touched - when you touched on it related to the U.S. I was actually going to bring up the 60 million to 90 million included obviously two-thirds of that subs that we were going to get from outside the United States, where except for just a few markets we've not even launched yet. So, it's far too early for us after, basically, a quarter and a little bit more under our belt to change our guidance, having not launched in any of the big international markets yet. What we know about those markets, not in any way pour cold water on them, because we know that those brands are strong in the markets, and this product is already working. The interest in streaming, in general, in those markets, isn't as high as it has been in the United States. I'm talking about across the world. So we have probably more of a marketing effort and I'd say, more of a challenge to launch in those markets, not that those markets haven't been already seeded with streaming, we know Netflix has done extremely well Internationally. But we're just beginning there, and I think it's just premature for us to take our guidance up. What we do know, of course, is that we have reached a number in the United States that since you did the math that would suggest that we're at the number that we predicted we would be in year five, just after a very short period of time, and I don't know whether that is a statement about the total available market or the quality of the product or both, or the price. It is just the way I think a number of factors that I've touched upon, and I just - I'll go over them one more time. Those brands are extreme - not only are they high quality, It is a very unique product. I was asked earlier on CNBC about whether I felt threatened by competition, there's obviously more competition coming into the space, But there isn't any competition that is like ours, like our product, because of the investments that we've made in those franchises and the quality of the product that we've made over the years and we're continuing to make. So we're very differentiated, we're extremely well priced. And we created a service tech - from a technical basis and the user interface basis, that is really working. There's an elegance to it and an ease, and we feel great about it. So our - as we look ahead at that guidance, and I can't say that we won't change in at some point, but it's - we don't believe that it would be prudent for us to adjust it at this point, and we have a long way to go.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nDoug Mitchelson: I am going to keep going on Disney+ but, Bob, I think congratulations are - in order on the success of the service, so far. A couple of things, in terms of consumption patterns for the Disney+ service, is this a service households are using every day or they're using every week, and any sort of issues or thoughts around consumption levels after the initial sign-up period is - where people can then leave the service, a bunch of them starts to fade after that or did you find that it stayed relatively level? And I am interested, Bob, you talked a lot about in India, but interested about the launch in Europe broadly and contrasting it with the first series of markets. So is the content that is available on the service in the U.S., also, sort of the same content available in Europe, and any sort of differences or nuances in go-to-market, marketing and distribution efforts in any of those countries that we should be aware of as we try to gauge how successful Europe might be? Thank you.\nRobert Iger: We measured - in terms of the - I'll call it engagement, we've measured recency, which is essentially how many people are - used it recently, are active users on a weekly basis, that's extremely high. We measure frequency, which is a number of times people stream per week since launch and we measure engagement, which is basically how many hours people have streamed on a weekly or basis per subscriber, and I don't think we should get into all those details right now, except to say that in all three cases, recency, the percentage of people that it - are weekly active users, very, very high. The same thing is true with frequency the number of average days that they actually use the service, and again this is something that we've seen over both - basically, the first quarter. I think these numbers probably relate to the first quarter and not necessarily since December 28, that's also very high and the engagement, or we were looking at multiple hours a week stream, per subscriber. I can give you that now, that's in the six hours to seven hours a week range, very, very high. Now Christmas was in there, time when a lot of families were off, that may have actually skewed that a little bit high, but again we're seeing consumption, I'll call it across the board, and in sum, it is quite interesting to us. Pixar has done extremely well, as a, for instance, including their shorts, musicals are doing very, very well. Obviously, great interest in some of the big titles that have recently come on the service. Toy Story 4 just came on. I think, Rise of Skywalker later in the year. Lion King came on, Avengers, I mentioned Endgame. It's kind of, I guess, and without, in anyway, sounding like we're bragging, it validates the concept of putting those brands together and collecting library. As we look to the rest of the world, there really isn't anything to cite in terms of encumbrances that would be an issue. We're in relatively good shape there. I'd say that we have some work to do in terms of local product, because there are quotas in certain markets that we have to meet. But the universal appeal of - of this product is - is pretty strong. You do have to factor in that, in some markets, there's lower broadband penetration. And so you don't have the total available - the total available market is not as high as it is in other markets. Netherlands was very high. That's why we decided the launch there. South Korea is very high. But there are other markets, obviously, India being one, that you have lower broadband. But huge opportunities - huge opportunities for us, Internationally, and that's where that Disney name and that family nature of the product, I think, will resonate extremely well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nTodd Juenger: One quick one on Hulu, as far as I could and then, I'd love to talk about the Parks for little change of break here. So just on Hulu - on the Hulu SVOD ARPU, that $13-plus number, struck - stuck out to us, it's - it's even higher than the non-advertising Hulu - SVOD list price. So just wondering if you could share what's going on with advertising ARPU on the Hulu SVOD, it must be a big number. And anything you could share there would be helpful to understand. And then on the Parks, a couple of really minor ones, and then a bigger one. Christine, if you could remind us, for the U.S. domestic Parks, what percent of attendance comes from international visitation, and particularly from Asia, and if you're thinking about that at all, when you think about the near-term effects of the virus and the travel curtailments there? Longer term, Bob, I hope you'll accept this question, I'm not - just wondering how you think about the growth function for parks. It's a question we get from investors all the time it's super important. We'd love if you just share your thoughts, because I think what investors look at is so much of revenue and income growth has come from increased spend per guest in the form of either pricing or merchandise and food volumes. The question we wrestle with is gee how long can that keep going, right? Is there some point at which either your consumer gets priced out or - just competition sets in or that sort of thing and [indiscernible] sets in. So without asking for formal guidance, I just loved - is there still more opportunity on the yield side or how long can you push that, are there other ways the parks can grow over time? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: Okay thanks, Todd.\nRobert Iger: I think we go first because we want to do is Hulu SVOD ARPU?\nChristine McCarthy: Hulu SVOD ARPU is very strong. The ad-supported, the product is priced at $5.99 and - but the ad-supported part of the equation, it makes the ARPU come out even higher than the ad free. Most of the subscribers subscribe to the ad-supported. So that's a good balance of the ARPUs when you stack them up next to each other. Let me take the domestic park question on international visitation. We have typically run in the 18% to 22% range for guests outside of the U.S. We're at the low-end of that range, maybe a tick below right now because some of the South American markets, because of the disruption in those economies have had lower visitation. The two I would cite, would be - that won't be a surprise to anyone, would be Brazil and Argentina. In general, the parks do not have a significant amount of visitation from Asia. When you look at Walt Disney World, no Asian market even factors into the top five, and the top one being the UK, which I think everyone knows that. And then we have Brazil, Canada, Mexico and Argentina, that is for the East Coast, Walt Disney World. And then when you look at Disneyland, Canada is a very strong market for us, no surprise, just given proximity to the West Coast markets of Vancouver. And then, we also have Mexico, Australia, and the only market that even breaks into the top five would be Japan and it's actually a very low single-digit number for Disneyland. And so far, there has been no evidence that there is any impact on the intent to visit, or people fulfilling reservations or commitments from Coronavirus.\nRobert Iger: And regarding other growth possibilities for the parks, it's really going to be a blend. We continue to invest capital to build out new attractions, new hotels, new restaurants. We've announced many different projects. Obviously, we just opened Rise of the Resistance and that's done extremely well, not just in terms of attendance but per capita spending has been quite high. We have a variety of different Marvel projects underway. The Avengers project in California, and a number of Marvel related things in Florida, including a Guardians of the Galaxy E-ticket attraction. So, we're going to continue to build out against the Company's most popular, or using the most popular franchises. And as I mentioned, build out hotels as well. We just opened one Riviera Resort we're opening one in Florida. We have a Star Wars themed hotel coming, a lot of activity there. We will look for international opportunities as well. They still exist, and obviously, the virus has slowed things down a bit, but we expect that when that passes that we will start looking expansively in other territories. And of course, lastly there is a yield story to tell and that's been exceptional that is a combination of things. But clearly, far more sophisticated, more thoughtful pricing strategy has helped a lot. Taking advantage of peak periods and pricing leverage but also making the parks more accessible in non-peak periods for others at substantially more accessible prices.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nSteven Cahall: Just two quick ones but maybe first on Disney+. It seems like you priced this exactly right, given the market response. I would think you could kind of make life harder on some of your more expensive streaming competition like Netflix or HBO by keeping the price low for as long as you can and keeping that engagement with customers. So just kind of curious how you're thinking about the price of Disney+ long-term does it go up over time or do you sort of keep it as it is? And then, Christine, just wondering if you could maybe give us a little more color on how to think about the studio for the year, there is just a lot of moving parts there. I know theatrical is impossible to predict, but then you've also got the synergy with the Fox Studios and the transfer pricing. So, how do we kind of think about the income production of the studio this year given all those different pieces? Thanks.\nRobert Iger: Yes Steve, we haven't had a conversation about price since we launched except that we felt that our pricing strategy has worked. We really are not focused right now on price at all. We believed all along that we would have an opportunity to address pricing as we added more content, really original content, and the price-value relationship went up to the consumer, but it's not a priority of ours right now. We're still as we\u2019re very new with this. So, I think it would be premature for us to start talking about, and don't expect anything in the near term, very near term from a price increase perspective. Christine, you want to take the question about the studio?\nChristine McCarthy: Yes let me take that. As Bob already mentioned our studio, our legacy Disney studio had nothing short of a truly phenomenal year six movies, over $1 billion in the global box office. That is an incredibly hard - seven movies over sorry about that. seven movies over $1 billion, that's an incredibly hard comp on a year-over-year. So, we will still - we still believe that our studio will be very successful this year. And we have confidence in their content resonating with consumers on a global basis. Bob already mentioned some of the big movies that we have coming out, and we feel really good about those. As it relates to transfer pricing of content, the studio definitely will benefit from the content sales to DTCI. The Pay 1 windows and we had quite a few movies come out in fiscal 2019, that will make it into the Pay 1 window in fiscal 2020, and that will also have a positive impact on the studio.\nOperator: And our final question comes from David Miller with Imperial Capital. Your line is now open.\nDavid Miller: Bob, as you know, I've covered you guys for a long time, and I've covered the theaters for a long time. And I've probably heard you say maybe a dozen times over the last four years that you are 100% committed to the theatrical window, going forward, despite the launch of Disney+. The problem is that, and I would never accuse you of being disingenuous, you know that but the problem is that the market doesn't really believe that given 52-week lows on excuse me AMC and Cinemark and to some extent Marcus. So on this call, would you be willing to kind of recommit to the theatrical window or I should say, what would you have to say going forward about your overall commitment to the theatrical window given your market leadership in that regard? Thanks so much.\nRobert Iger: The theatrical window is working for this company and we have no plans to adjust it for our business. Your comment about how those companies are faring on the market, I think, maybe is a reflection of how the other movie companies are positioning their films and their business we're not the only movie company. We are the biggest Box Office, but we're not the only movie company and I suspect that it's not due to us or either a lack of conviction on our part or any suspicion that we might not be - that we might not be telling the truth.\nDavid Miller: Right.\nRobert Iger: But we're not - it's working for us, and we have no plans in the foreseeable future to change it that requires.\nLowell Singer: Thank you, David, and thanks everyone for joining us today.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Tammy Munsey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nTammy Munsey: Good afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome everyone to the Walt Disney Company's fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www. disney. com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and we'll post a transcript of this call to our website. Joining me remotely today are Bob Chapek, Disney's Chief Executive Officer, and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we'll of course, be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nBob Chapek: Thanks, Tammy, and good afternoon, everyone. As we close out the fourth quarter, I'm pleased to say that it's been a very productive year for The Walt Disney Company. As we've made great strides in reopening our business, while also taking meaningful and innovative steps to position ourselves for continued long-term growth. Despite the many ongoing challenges of the pandemic, we ended the quarter with adjusted EPS of $0.37 compared to a loss of $0.20 last year. Christine will go more in-depth on the quarter and the coming year in her remarks. Last quarter, we talked about our strategic priorities for the future. And as we head into fiscal '22, we remain keenly focused on advancing them to drive our continued growth. First and foremost, telling the world's most original enduring stories. Second, maximizing the synergy of our unique ecosystem to deepen consumers' connection to our characters and our stories. And lastly, using the power of our far reaching platforms and new technologies to give consumers the best entertainment experience possible.  I'll briefly talk about how we are executing against these priorities in 3 key areas: Direct-to-Consumer, sports, and Parks, Experiences, and Products. On the Direct-to-Consumer side, we are extremely pleased with the success of our portfolio streaming services. Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu continue to perform incredibly well with a 118.1 million, 17.1 million, and 43.8 million subscribers, respectively, for a total of a 179 million subscriptions. To put this growth in perspective, in the past fiscal year alone, we have grown the total number of subscriptions across our DTC portfolio by 48%, and Disney+ subs in particular by 60%. I want to reiterate that we remain focused on managing our DTC business for the long-term, not quarter-to-quarter. And we're confident we are on the right trajectory to achieve the guidance that we provided at last year's Investors Day, reaching between 230 million and 260 million paid Disney+ subscribers globally by the end of fiscal year 2024, and with Disney+ achieving profitability that same year.  This Friday, we will celebrate the 2-year anniversary of the launch of Disney+ with our first ever Disney+ Day of global, Company-wide celebration. We are enormously proud of all that we've accomplished with the service in just the first 2 years. It has exceeded our wildest expectations, and we are so excited for what's to come. With this in mind, we have numerous activations planned across the entire Company for Disney+ Day, including the streaming premiere of Marvel Shang-Chi and The Legend of the Ten Rings, which has already surpassed $430 million at the global box office. Other content coming to the service on Disney+ Day includes the highly anticipated Disney+ original movie, Home Sweet Home Alone, the epic adventure, Jungle Cruise, and a hilarious new short from The Simpsons, and the first 5 episodes of season 2 of the fantastic National Geographic series, The World According to Jeff Goldblum.  And there's more great content in the pipeline. On the heels of Disney+ Day, we'll premiere 2 amazing new original series, Marvel's Hawkeye on November 24th, and the latest Star Wars adventure, The Book of Boba Fett on December 29th. And of course, we're extremely excited about the Thanksgiving holiday weekend debut of The Beatles: Get Back, Peter Jackson's highly anticipated 3-part documentary. Additionally, Marvel's Eternals, which has reached more than $161 million at the global box office in less than a week and Disney's Encanto, which premieres in theaters on November 24th, will come to the service after their exclusive theatrical runs. In total, we are nearly doubling the amount of original content from our marquee brands, Disney, Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars, and National Geographic coming to Disney+ in FY '22, with the majority of our highly anticipated titles arriving July through September.  This represents the beginning of the surge of new content shared last December at our investor conference 2.0. We recognize that the single most effective way to grow our streaming platforms worldwide is with great content. And we are singularly focused on making new, high-quality entertainment, including local and regional content that we believe will resonate with audiences. Of note, we have 340 plus local original titles in various stages of development and production for our DTC platforms over the next few years. As you know, we announced at our last Investor Day that we expect our total content expense to be between $8 and $9 billion in fiscal 2024, and we will now be increasing that investment further with the primary driver being more local and regional content. We are expanding our global reach by introducing Disney+ in additional markets around the world.  The service is now available throughout Japan and we're thrilled to be launching it this Friday on Disney+ Day in South Korea, in Taiwan, and in Hong Kong on November 16. In just 2 short years, we're now in over 60 countries and more than 20 languages. And next year, we plan to bring Disney+ to consumers in 50 plus additional countries, including in Central, Eastern Europe, The Middle East, and South Africa. Our goal is to more than double the number of countries we are currently in to over 160 by fiscal year '23. Turning to Sports, we continue to build out ESPN+ with exclusive sports content that makes our DTC offering the perfect complement to the ESPN linear experience. And with every new sports rights deal, we have considered both linear and DTC. In fact, all 7 of the major deals we made in the last year-and-a-half included a streaming component.  Among them is our historic 10-year NFL rights agreement, which begins in 2023. We also recently signed a 5-year deal with the league for Monday night Wild Card game, which runs through 2025. Another example is our 7-year rights deal with the NHL, 75 of the League's live national games are and will be available exclusively on ESPN+ and Hulu. And ESPN+ is the sole home for more than 1,000 out-of-market NHL games. By the way, this is another reason that Disney Bundle is proving highly appealing to consumers. Because live sports are key element, and a key differentiator of our Disney ecosystem. Some 90% of the most-watched telecast last year were sports, and they continue to perform extremely well. For example, the NHL's opening night games on ESPN last month marked the highest viewed season opening doubleheader on record, with an increase of 54% over the 2019/2020 season opening day letter.  And we are particularly pleased with the NHL 's Direct-to-Consumer performance on ESPN+ and Hulu. Likewise, the hugely popular UFC, fresh off a strong card at Madison Square Garden last weekend, continues to be a top performer for ESPN+ with 6 of the top UFC on ESPN+ pay-per-views coming in the past year. At the same time, we continue to expand our original sports programming with innovative broadcast like the hugely popular Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli, which airs on ESPN2, and reached 1.9 million viewers by its second week, as well as the highly anticipated new shows like Man in the Arena: Tom Brady, the multi-part docuseries about the legendary quarterback premiering on ESPN+ on November 16, along with a host of fantastic new social and digital shows and podcast.  We're also moving towards a greater presence in online sports betting. And given our reaching scale, we have the potential to partner with third-parties in this space in a very meaningful way. Suffice to say, we continue to see enormous opportunity in sports, and all of this, the right steels, our innovative programming, and the flexibility achieved through our DTC business, which saw ESPN+ subscribers, increased by 66% over the past fiscal year alone. All of this is a testament to the clear ambition we have in sports. One of the things that sets The Walt Disney Company apart is our unique access to an incredible number of consumer touch points across our businesses. That, of course, includes our parks and resorts, where we've achieved a number of important milestones since our last earnings call, including the first full quarter since the pandemic began with all of our Parks around the world open to guests, albeit with some limits on capacity, and the return of our entire Disney Cruise Line.  At the same time, the U.S. government's approval of vaccines for 5 to 11-year-olds, and the reopening of borders to fully vaccinated international travelers are both important steps towards the recovery of our business. But what is perhaps most exciting is the work that we have done during the time our Parks were closed to re-engineer and re-imagine the guest experience. We have introduced a number of exciting new offerings that enable guests to create their best Disney Day. In late August, Disneyland Resort launched Magic Key, the new annual membership program that is resonating strongly with Legacy Annual Passholders, while also attracting new passholders. In fact, about 40% of current sales are to new passholders. And most Magic Key holders have purchased the top 2 tiers, Dream Key and Believe Key. With Dream Key selling out in just 2 months.  We're also seeing a great response to the new Annual Passholder program at Walt Disney World. A testament to the demand for our in-park experiences and the success of our yield management strategy. Walt Disney World rolled out its new multi-tiered full service app, Disney Genie, which allows guests to easily and efficiently navigate everything our parks have to offer in order to have the best experience possible. The response to the service in just its first month has been extremely positive. The majority of Genie and Genie+ users have said it improved their overall park experience with nearly 1/3 of park guests upgrading to Genie+, making it possible for them to spend less time waiting in line and more time enjoying attractions, entertainment, dining, and retail opportunities. We are very encouraged by what we're seeing and look forward to launching Disney Genie at Disneyland very soon.  Alongside these transformative programs, we continue to invest in our parks and resorts themselves. We introduced a host of new attractions as part of Walt Disney World's 50th anniversary celebration, which kicked off on October 1st. These include Remy's Ratatouille Adventure at EPCOT, which has quickly become one of the parks top attractions, our new themed restaurant SPACE 220, and Two New Nighttime Spectaculars. And there is lots more in store in the coming month, including the highly anticipated indoor coaster Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind, and the one-of-a-kind Galactic Starcruiser experience. As part of this immersive 2-night adventure, guests will become heroes of their own Star Wars stories. Reservations went on sale just 3 weeks ago, and the first 4 months of voyages have virtually sold out for this premium experience.  Disney Cruise Line continues to be one of the highest rated guest experiences of any of our offerings. As I said earlier, all 4 of our ships are now sailing and we continue to see tremendous demand for the incredible experiences we offer at sea. We are thrilled to be launching a new ship, the Disney Wish in June of 2022 and will welcome her sister ships to the fleet in 2024 and 2025. Combined, these 3 vessels will help increase capacity and our footprint in a business that has historically generated a double-digit return on investment, driven by a premium price might well above the industry average. Before leaving our Parks and Experiences, I want to mention the continued transformation of our Consumer Products business. We have almost completed the reduction of our physical footprint, which will enable us to pivot our approach with a focus on our e-commerce platform, shopDisney, and on more compelling retail partnerships, such as Disney Store at Target, which will triple its locations by the end of the year.  In short, our parks around the globe now have more to offer guests than ever before, with our new offerings and we're making it even easier for them to have the best time imaginable, tailored specifically to their individual needs and preferences in a way, only Disney can. Our Company is truly unique and that we have a significant presence in the physical world through our parks and resorts, as well as media entertainment assets in the digital world. And it is incredible to see how our use of our emerging technology and insights gained through our innumerable consumer touch points, is enabling us to transform the way people interact with and experience our stories and products in both worlds. The Walt Disney Company has a long track record as an early adopter in the use of technology to enhance the entertainment experience.  Steamboat Willie, the first cartoon with synchronize sound, our groundbreaking development and use of Audio-Animatronics, we were the first to distribute downloaded content on the new Apple iPod back in 2005, Pixar has been a pioneer in computer animation, these are just a few examples. Suffice it to say, our efforts to-date are merely a prologue to a time when we'll be able to connect the physical and digital worlds even more closely, allowing for storytelling without boundaries in our own Disney metaverse. And we look forward to creating unparalleled opportunities for consumers to experience everything Disney has to offer across our products and platforms wherever the consumer may be. As we look ahead to this next frontier, given our unique combination of brands, franchises, physical and digital experiences, and global reach, we see limitless potential, and that makes as excited as ever about The Walt Disney Company's next 100 years. With that, I'll turn it over to Christine, and she'll talk in greater detail about the quarter and the year ahead.\nChristine Mccarthy: Thank you, Bob. And good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the fourth fiscal quarter was $0.37, an increase of $0.57 from the prior year quarter. For the full fiscal 2021 year, diluted EPS excluding certain items was $2.29, or an increase of $0.27 versus the prior year. As a reminder, these results take into account that fiscal 2020 was a 53-week year compared to our usual 52-week year in 2021. We estimate that the additional week in 2020 resulted in a benefit to pre -tax income of approximately $200 million, primarily at the Media and Entertainment Distribution segment, creating an unfavorable comparison for fiscal year '21. I'll now turn to our results in the quarter by segment, beginning with Parks, Experiences, and Products where fourth quarter operating income increased by $1.6 billion year-over-year. A profitable fourth quarter at Parks and Experiences reflects our ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.  All of our sites were open for the entire quarter, although generally at reduced capacities. In the prior-year quarter, Shanghai Disney Resort was open for the entire quarter, while Disney World Resort and Disneyland Paris were open for approximately 12 weeks. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was open for approximately 4 weeks. And Disneyland Resort was closed for the entire quarter. Attendance trends continued to strengthen at our domestic parks, with Walt Disney World Q4 attendance up double-digits versus Q3, and Disneyland attendance continuing to strengthen significantly from its reopening in the third quarter. Guest spending at our domestic parks also continued its strong trend, with per cap in the fourth quarter up nearly 30% versus fiscal 2019.  Our forward-looking demand pipeline for domestic guests at Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resort remains strong, demonstrating our brand strength, as well as more normalized consumer behavior. Additionally, we're looking forward to the return of international attendance at our domestic parks and resorts. However, keep in mind that due to longer vacation planning lead times, we don't expect to see a substantial recovery in international attendance at our domestic parks until towards the end of fiscal 2022. At our cruise line business, as Bob mentioned earlier, our entire fleet has returned to sea with guest ratings as strong as pre -pandemic levels despite new health and safety protocols. While we expect social distancing restrictions on our ships to remain in place for at least the first half of fiscal 2022, booked occupancy on our ships for the second half of the year is already ahead of historical ranges at significantly higher pricing.  And we are excited for the Disney Wish to set sail in June 2022, with the inaugural season already nearly 90% booked. At consumer products, year-over-year operating results declined in the fourth quarter, impacted by a tough comparison in our games business due to the prior year performance of 2 titles, Marvel's Avengers and Twisted Wonderland. Turning to our Media and Entertainment Distribution segment, fourth quarter operating income decreased by approximately $600 million versus the prior year driven by lower results at Linear Networks, Direct-to-Consumer and content sales, licensing, and other. At Linear Networks, you may recall that we guided to a decline in Q4 operating income versus prior year. Operating results at Linear Networks did decrease year-over-year by approximately $200 million driven by a decrease at our domestic channels, partially offset by an improvement at our international channels. At our domestic channels, both broadcasting and cable operating income decreased in the fourth quarter versus the prior year.  Lower results of broadcasting were driven by lower results at ABC and the owned television stations. At ABC, the decrease was primarily driven by higher marketing and programming and production costs, reflecting a higher number of series versus the prior year due to last year's production delays as we noted in the guidance we gave last quarter, partially offset by higher affiliate revenue. The decrease at the owned television stations was due to lower advertising revenue, reflecting comparisons to the 53rd week and stronger political advertising in the prior year. At Cable, the year-over-year decrease in operating income was primarily driven by 3 factors. 1. Lower affiliate revenue, primarily driven by the prior-year benefit of the 53rd week. 2. An increase in marketing cost for more titles premiering in the current quarter, which we also discussed last quarter.  And finally, to a lesser extent, lower advertising revenue. These impacts were partially offset by lower programming and production costs, which generally reflect COVID-19 related timing impacts from the prior year. Cost decreased for the NBA and MLB programming versus the prior year, partially offset by increased cost for college football games. Domestic Linear Networks advertising revenue decreased in Q4 versus the prior year, driven by our Cable networks and owned television stations. Both of which were impacted by the prior-year benefit of the 53rd week. ESPN advertising revenue in the fourth quarter was comparable to the prior year, as higher rates were offset by the prior-year benefit of the 53rd week. First quarter to date, domestic cash advertising revenue at ESPN is currently pacing above the prior year, benefiting from increased ratings for college football and the NFL. Total domestic affiliate revenue decreased by 6% in the quarter.  This was driven by a benefit of 6 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 7 point decline due to the 53rd week adjustment and a 3 point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. International channel results increased versus the prior year driven by lower programming and production costs and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by lower affiliate revenue. At Direct-to-Consumer, our fourth quarter operating results decreased by $256 million year-over-year, driven by higher losses at Disney+ and ESPN+, partially offset by improved results at Hulu. At Disney+, the higher loss versus the prior-year quarter was driven by higher programming, marketing, and technology costs. These higher costs were partially offset by increases in Subscription and Premier Access revenue.  Higher Subscription revenue reflects subscriber growth, and increases in retail pricing. And the increases in costs reflect the ongoing expansion of Disney+. Higher Premier Access revenue was driven by Black Widow and Jungle Cruise in Q4 compared to Mulan in the prior-year quarter. As Bob mentioned earlier, we ended the fourth quarter and the fiscal year with over 118 million global paid Disney+ subscribers, reflecting over 2 million net additions from Q3 in line with the subscriber guidance we gave in September. Subscribers across our domestic and core international markets, excluding Disney+ Hotstar grew by almost 4 million from Q3 to Q4. Disney+ Hotstar subs decreased versus the prior quarter and accounted for about 37% of our total Disney+ paid subscriber base as of the end of the fourth quarter. Disney+ 's global ARPU in the fourth quarter was $4.12.  Excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $6.24 or an increase of about $0.12 versus the third quarter continuing to benefit from recent price increases. At ESPN+ where we ended the fourth quarter with over 17 million subscribers versus nearly 15 million in Q3, the decrease in operating results year-over-year was driven by higher marketing and sports programming costs, partially offset by subscription revenue growth. And at Hulu, higher operating results in the fourth quarter versus the prior year were due to subscription revenue growth, and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by increases in programming, and to a lesser extent, marketing costs. Hulu ended the fourth quarter with 43.8 million paid subscribers, inclusive of the Hulu Live digital MVPD service.  Hulu Live subscribers increased to 4 million from 3.7 million at the end of the third quarter. Moving on to Content Sales, Licensing, and Other, results decreased in the fourth quarter versus the prior year to an operating loss of $65 million, driven by lower theatrical and TV/SVOD distribution results, both of which we noted as drivers in the guidance we gave during the last earnings call. While theaters have generally reopened, we are still experiencing a prolonged and gradual pace of recovery in this business. Lower theatrical results were driven by higher operating losses from more titles and release, as well as higher marketing expenses for future releases. Lower TV/SVOD results were due to lower third-party content licensing of film content, driven by the ongoing impact of COVID, as well as our strategic shift towards distribution on our DTC services, partially offset by higher income from sales of episodic content due to lower write-offs versus the prior year.  To conclude, as we progress into fiscal 2022 and beyond, there are a number of items I would like to mention. Our capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 were $3.6 billion or approximately $400 million lower than our fiscal 2020 CapEx of $4 billion. CapEx for the year came in lower than the previous guidance we gave primarily due to spending delays across the enterprise. For fiscal 2022, we expect CapEx to increase by $2.5 billion versus 2021, driven by the delivery of the Disney Wish, as well as other increased spending at DPEP incorporate. At DPEP, we expect that per cap spending at our domestic Parks in fiscal 2022 will continue to significantly exceed pre -pandemic levels, and we are particularly encouraged by the early response we are seeing to Genie at Walt Disney World. However, we also expect that while we continue to pursue strong cost mitigation efforts, certain costs will be elevated in fiscal '22 versus pre -pandemic levels, including for example, inflationary pressure on wages, costs related to new projects and initiatives such as Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, Avengers Campus, and the EPCOT expansion and a ramp up of expenses in support of our cruise ship expansion.  And as we think about fiscal '22 results at DMED, there are few things worth noting. First, we are excited about the 9 theatrical releases we have slated for the first quarter of fiscal '22. However, we expect that the prolonged recovery we're seeing in the theatrical market, paired with the marketing costs associated with each release may adversely impact theatrical operating results in the first quarter by approximately $300 million versus the prior-year quarter, which had only 2 releases. At Linear Networks, we expect that first quarter operating income will decrease by nearly $500 million versus the prior year. Reflecting factors including higher contractual sports rights costs for college football and the NFL. Timing of cricket expenses at Star India  an adverse comparison to the prior year's political advertising revenue.  Finally as it relates to our expectations for Disney+. Looking at fiscal '22, we are thrilled about the quality of the content coming in the first 3 quarters of the year. But we will not yet be at our anticipated steady-state cadence of content releases. The fourth quarter will likely be more indicative of what our slate could look like once we have  content flowing steadily from all of our industry-leading creative engines. Q4 will be the first time in Disney+ history that we plan to release original content throughout the quarter from Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, and Nat Geo all in one quarter. This include highly anticipated titles such as Ms. Marvel, Andor, and Pinocchio. And as Bob mentioned earlier, we are also increasing our local content offerings in Asia, India, Europe, and Latin America in fiscal 2022, with the majority of those titles also releasing in the back part of the year.  As we've discussed before, we don't anticipate that sub-growth will necessarily be linear from quarter-to-quarter. So putting this all together and also taking into consideration the timing of our planned international launches in 2022, we expect Disney+ subscriber net adds in the second half of fiscal 2022 will be meaningfully higher than the first half of the year. Additionally, we now expect the Disney+ will reach its peak year of losses in fiscal 2022 instead of in fiscal 2021, as better-than-expected revenue and lower content expenses due to production delays contributed to lower-than-expected losses in 2021. As Bob mentioned, we are increasing our overall long-term content expense for Disney+. And we believe we are well-positioned to achieve the subscriber target of 230 million to 260 million by fiscal 2024 that we laid out at last year's Investor Day. And we also remain confident in our expectations that Disney+ will achieve profitability in fiscal 2024. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tammy, and we would be happy to take your questions.\nTammy Munsey: Thanks, Christine. As we transition to the Q&A, let me know that since we are not physically together this afternoon, I will do my best to moderate the Q&A by directing your questions to the appropriate executive. And with that Jonathan, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please?\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Good afternoon. Bob or -- and/or Christine. I think there's 2 areas where expectations have probably been out of line with reality this year, that's a  on the stock. One of them is the Disney+ net adds, the other is probably more recently on Parks margins and you talked a lot about both of those in your prepared remarks. But maybe you could just spend a minute, on both topics. On Disney+, it sounds like we should think about net-adds being higher in 23 and 24 than in 22 based on the surge that I think you mentioned, Bob, on the programming side. So I'm wondering if you could help us with that. I think that would help set the expectations in the right spot. And then on the Parks front. Bob, you talked a lot about Parks margins, when you get back to prior peak revenues being at or maybe even higher than before, but obviously there is also not a linear ramp on the margin front either. So if you could talk a little bit about how expenses come back into the business over the course of time as it recovers relative to revenue, so we make sure we're thinking about that business the right way in this set of unusual circumstance coming out of a pandemic. Thank you.\nTammy Munsey: Bob, why don't you start off with Disney+ net ads, and Parks as well. And then Christine, maybe you can chime in on the expenses for Parks?\nBob Chapek: Okay. Thank you, Ben. On the Disney+ side, as Christine had said, we're real pleased with where we're sitting. But again, it's not going to be a linear rate quarter to quarter. I think the recovery that you mentioned in terms of getting the growth rate back up to where it's been historically, is really going to come in the third and the fourth quarters. The third quarter will be powered, not necessarily by the content, but by the number of ads that we have in terms of markets. Our number of markets that we're going to add will essentially double to more than 160 by FY2023, and that will propel us in the third quarter. And the fourth quarter will be more of a function of that. Finally, the dam will break in terms of the content that we announced last December that will be substantial, and will lead to a cadence of content throughout the quarter that will look more like what we expect to see from an ongoing standpoint.  Obviously, we're only in year 2 of the Disney+ launch, and the hunger for content, for the service is extraordinary. And when you have that happen at the same time that you have a pandemic, and you have to shut down production. That's not a good combination. And yet we identified the need for the content way-back exactly a year ago, and have prepared a very strong cadence of content which will now hit the pipeline in the second half of this year. In terms of the park situation, we are very bullish. We're seeing incredible 30% increases in per caps, as I think was referenced in the earnings letter. And so we're not only seeing strong demand, but it's at per caps that are much higher than we've traditionally seen.  There was a reference and I am not sure if everyone appreciates the gravity of this to the Genie+ success, 1/3 of our guests at Walt Disney World, are buying the Genie+ upgrade at $15, that's per guest, per day. And that is a very, very material increase for in per-caps, but also in margins. So we're very bullish about both our Disney+ business, both in terms of  of guidance that has been given today. But additionally, in terms of where our Parks business is going to go from a demand standpoint once we completely clear the pandemic, but also in terms of the what we expect to be a long lasting benefits in terms of yields. Christine?\nChristine Mccarthy: Thanks, Bob. And thanks, Ben. I'm glad you asked the question on Parks expenses. And I know you know this business well, but just for the benefit of some others that maybe newer to following Disney. Let's remember that the Parks expenses are in 3 buckets, fixed, which is quite substantial, semi-fixed, and variable. So variable was where we were really able to make some adjustments during COVID. But the other fixed and semi-fixed buckets are ones that we have to carry on regardless of the operating environment that we found ourselves in. So as we come back online, we've also done a lot of work on fundamentally changing some of the ways we've have done business on both the revenue side and the cost side to optimize margins. What you see this fourth quarter is an overall margin for the global business, for DPEP, a little under 12%, and that's well below our pre - COVID levels.  I've said this before and I'll say it again, that I believe that we will get not only back too, but have high probability of exceeding those previous margin levels in our parks because of some of the things we've done. We're using date-based pricing. We're strategically managing attendance. We do have some promotional offers that are really meant to balance yield with the demand, given capacity on any given day or week during the year. And on the cost efficiency side, we really made some improvements, not only to the cost side, but also that improves the guest experience. So those are things like the mobile food ordering that we have, a lot of people who have been to our parks since we reopened really enjoyed that. There's contactless check-ins at our hotels; lots of people enjoy that as well. We have virtual queues for selected attractions, and we're once again really looking at even physical park improvements that allow for better guests movement throughout the Parks.  So while these margins will remain impacted, while we are still operating under capacity constraints, again, we believe over the long term that these fundamental changes are going to yield -- are going to result in higher margins overall. So thanks for asking that question. And the other thing I would say is, Bob mentioned, Genie. Genie we have launched in Walt Disney World. We have not yet launched it in Disneyland. And I think when we have that exposure to the Disneyland, people who come to visit Disneyland -- the response will be as strong if not stronger. Thanks.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you both.\nTammy Munsey: Thank you, Ben. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Your question, please.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Just a few questions if I may. First, ARPU on Hotstar is obviously lower than core Disney+ jobs. I'm curious if you could elaborate on the opportunity to narrow that gap over time and does it eventually become profitable contributor and maybe how much investment is needed in a big picture in that property? And then just my follow-up question is on the -- your decision to revert back to include the Asheboro releases, at least for now, it looks like even though they might be lost incurring initially, why do you ultimately feel that's a better model? Was it piracy, any color there? Thank you.\nTammy Munsey: Bob why don't you start with exclusive theatrical releases and then Christine can talk about Hotstar ARPU?\nBob Chapek: Okay. As you know, we have preached flexibility in terms of making decisions on distribution as we recover from the pandemic and in the mix of changing consumer behaviors. The extent to which we had a number of titles release going to theatrical will eventually go to Disney+, but what we're seeing is some recovery of the theatrical exhibition marketplace, which is a good thing by the way, for not only Disney but also for the industry, and because most of the franchises that we've had as Walt Disney Company have been built through the theatrical exhibition channel of distribution. At the same time, we're watching very, very carefully different types of movies to see how the different components of the demographics of that market come back. And we're watching very carefully our family films, as they are released over the next couple of months to make sure that that market will come back to theatrical exhibition as the general entertainment with say the films that appeal to a younger target audience have come back.  And so we're sticking with our plan of flexibility, because we're still unsure in terms of how the marketplace is going to react when family films come back with a theatrical first window. I should say that -- you'll notice that the films that we are putting into the marketplace, in theatrical that are family films have a fairly short window, at least in terms of any reference point to what history might have been. And we're doing that so that we can get our films quicker to Disney+ and -- but at the same time see if the theatrical market can kick back into full gear as we prime the pump with these films. But we're going to do what's best for our shareholders ultimately. And we don't announce our films that far in advance, like we used to because we know that we're in a time of flux and change still. And while COVID will be in the rearview mirror, God-willing, I think changing consumer behavior is something that's going to be more permanent. And so we're reading that on a weekly basis and make our decisions going forward accordingly.\nChristine Mccarthy: Thanks, Alexia, for your question on Hotstar ARPU. Just to make something very clear, the Disney+ Hotstar is included in our overall Disney+ guidance that we reiterate to be profitable in 2024. So I just want to make sure that everyone understands that. But as it relates to ARPU specifically, there's been a lot of noise in the Indian market, a lot of which has been around sport. So when you look at the ARPU for Hotstar on a linked quarter basis from Q3 to Q4 this year, it actually decreased, and that was a result of lower per sub advertising revenue because there were fewer IPL matches this year. In Q4, there were only 18, and I believe the number was 29-ish in Q3. So you had a linked-quarter reduction in games, therefore lower subscriber advertising revenue. And when we think about ARPU overall, there's several levers here. There is a price value relationship over time, high-quality content. And the content in India is really 2 things. It's not only the IPL, but other key sports like Beyond Cricket.  So you have things like the English Premier League and . And also there's a big general entertainment component. We have all of our Disney+ content over there for all the different labels that we have, Disney Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and so on. But they also have over 18,000 hours of original local programming that is produced every year. So once again, I think the upside potential as when all things are working, also cylinders are working and we'll be able to take price up as the market allows.\nTammy Munsey: Thank you. Thank you, Alexia. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Your question, please.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. Hey, Tammy. I have 2. One is I appreciate your view that the content side would get better, and it will drive some growth. But I really want to focus on the U.S. What gives you confidence that that's what is the reason for the slowing growth. Are there any cohorts, any demographics that you're underpenetrated. And perhaps the widening out of content is an issue versus just more new content. That's 1. And then 2 is we have covered Disney a long time, but I've never seen this much inflation before, and I don't think any of us have in 30 years. I wonder how will you mitigate that inflation, and at what point it would start becoming a meaningful drag on the margin recovery that you identified. Thanks.\nTammy Munsey: Thank you, Michael. Bob, how about if you talk about the Disney+ sub grows in the U.S. and Christine can talk about inflation?\nBob Chapek: So Michael, your first question was about the  of the supply chain  of new content coming into the service and its impact on our net sub adds. As you can probably suspect, in a world of to Direct-to-Consumer, we have a lot of information, a lot of data, and we have a pretty good idea of what the marginal impact of a particular title might be to our service, and we always say that library titles tend to increase engagement and minimize churn. But new titles, new content, whether the movies or series, add -- actually add new subs. And that is actually the reason why we're pretty confident that the increase in content flow towards the second half of fiscal '22 will actually lead to the types of results that we're anticipating. And so we've got some pretty good data that suggests that that is the case, given our history. While we only have two years, that two years has represented a number of titles, and you can start to build models as I'm sure you can understand.  Every time that we have a title, we have a pretty good idea of what the net impact that that's going to be, both from a retention and to an addition standpoint. So we're pretty confident that once we get to more of a normal content flow in the second half of the year that some of the vacuum that we've had over the last couple of months will not be the case. Christine, you want to handle the -- oh, and Charlie there was also a question about Cohorts widening. I'll handle that one as well. It is true that Disney+ is a 4 quadrant service. And as such, we need content that's going to be broad in order to appeal to each of those demographics. If there is an opportunity that we're working on right now, it's our preschool area. We believe that there's an opportunity for us to sort of assert ourselves in the Direct-to-Consumer way the same way we did in the Linear Networks with Disney Channel.  So that would be the biggest opportunity. And I can tell you that in sitting through our creator of reviews, the new content that we've got, the new storytelling that we've got in the area of preschool is absolutely extraordinary. And I think we're going to see a resurgence of Disney in that area in terms of content that's really going to become of the cultural zeitgeist, and then drive our subs amongst that particular cohort of potential sub-adds for Disney+. But it is true that being a 4-quadrant service, we need to be broad in our approach. And that's why we fired up the engines, the production engines of our Fox teams that we gotten in acquisitions  Searchlight, and just our general -- Disney General Entertainment team making content both for Hulu and for Disney+, as well as our services internationally. Christine?\nChristine Mccarthy: Thanks, Bob. Hi, Michael. I think you asked a question that's on the minds of every CFO and every senior management team of companies out there. Inflationary pressures are something we are all looking at and trying to assess, and think about how do we manage through it. This is also one that -- I just mentioned, we've already experienced in some parts of our business. So over the past year or so, we've talked about the increase in the price of content. You see the content, that because of just the competition for talent for everything that's involved in productions, content costs have gone up. Where we see it directly in our parks business is primarily through the hourly wage inflation that we've seen through contact -- contract renegotiation in our commitment to paying our park workers well.  And then we have things on the cost of goods side and it's interesting -- just last week maybe it was -- just last week I was talking to our Parks Senior Team about things we could do there, and there are lots of things that are worth talking about. We can adjust suppliers, we can substitute products, we can cut portion size which is probably good for some people's waistlines. We can look at pricing where necessary, but we aren't going to go just straight up across an increased prices. We're really going to try to get the algorithm right to cut where we can and not necessarily do things the same way.  As I mentioned, we're also using technology to reduce some of our operating costs, and that gives us a little bit of headroom also to absorb some inflation. But we're really trying to use our heads here to come up with a way to kind of mitigate some of these challenges that we have. It's a great question, and I'm sure it's one that you could ask every single Company in your coverage universe. Thanks.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks.\nTammy Munsey: Thank you Michael. Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Certainly. Our final question for today then comes from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. 2 of course. First, could you talk about the advertising outlook? There's a lot of moving pieces here between strong upfront, good sports ratings, but supply chain issues affecting some categories. And within advertising, if you could talk a little bit more about Hulu advertising, what's going on there with your aired light service versus pure premium subscription. And then the second question is -- I know Bob mentioned in prepared remarks -- sports betting. Can you frame or give us any color on the opportunity? Obviously, it's an area of growth as more states are approving it and it effects advertising, which should be good for the stations. But how can you participate in a bigger way while still protecting the ESPN brand?\nTammy Munsey: Thank you, Jessica. Bob, why don't you address sports betting and Christine can talk about advertising.\nBob Chapek: Okay. Will do. Jessica, you're right. We do believe that sports betting is a very significant opportunity for the Company, and it's all driven by the consumer. It's driven by the consumer, particularly the younger consumer that will replenish the sports fans over time and their desire to have gambling as part of their sports experience. It's not necessarily a lean-back, it's a little bit of a lean-forward type experience that they're looking for. And as we follow the consumer, we necessarily have to seriously consider getting into gambling in a bigger way. And ESPN is a perfect platform for this. We have done substantial research in terms of the impact to not only to ESPN brand, but the Disney brand in terms of consumers changing perceptions of the acceptability of gambling.  And what we're finding is that there's a very significant isolation. Gambling does not have the cache now that it had, say 10 or 20 years ago. And we have some concerns as a Company about our ability to get in it without having a brand withdrawal. But I can tell you that given all the research that we've done recently, that that is not the case. It actually strengthens the brand of ESPN when you have a betting component, and it has no impact on the Disney brand. Therefore, to go after that demographic opportunity plus the, of course, not insignificant revenue implications, that is something that we're keenly interested in and are pursuing aggressively.\nChristine Mccarthy: Okay. I'll take the advertising question, Jessica. So overall, the ad market is strong across our entire DMED portfolio. And the sports market is strong, and it's really being driven by football at both the college and professional level, NHL and the NBA. We are seeing some impact from supply chain issues impacting certain sales categories than the 2 that I would just call out are autos in technology and those are for obvious reasons that we all know about, the chip shortage. On Hulu specifically, we're really pleased with the advertising demand we've seen for Hulu. And we believe the overall addressable market in the U.S. market will continue to grow. Hulu, we believe also has some real strategic advantages in this space.  We've got a great slate of premium content and we've developed the ability to use our data to offer that targeting advertising, that advertisers really desire. And we also have a purpose built and unified ad platform. I mentioned this last quarter, but that's really helped us grow in addressable advertising. So we'll continue to make investments in technologies that are going to allow us to continue to exploit this advertising that we see on Hulu. And it's automating the sales process with programmatic, and advertisers self-service channels that we think are really going to continue to show good growth. So we expect advertising to continue to be an important driver of Hulu revenues going forward. Thanks.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you.\nTammy Munsey: Jessica, thanks for the question.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your host, Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nLowell Singer: Good afternoon, and it\u2019s my pleasure to welcome everyone to The Walt Disney Company\u2019s third quarter 2021 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today\u2019s call is also being webcast and we will post a transcript of this call to our website. Joining me remotely today are Bob Chapek, Disney\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we of course will be happy to take some of your questions. So, with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nBob Chapek: Thanks, Lowell, and hello, everyone. Today, I\u2019d like to start off by talking about our Company\u2019s priorities for the future. As has been the case for Disney\u2019s nearly 100-year history, it all begins with great storytelling, which is the foundation of our special connection to audiences and guests. And our foremost priority will continue to be to tell the world\u2019s most original and enduring stories brought to life by the world\u2019s most talented creators. As home to some of the most beloved franchises, we will maximize the synergy of our unique ecosystem to further deepen consumers\u2019 connection to our characters and stories. And we will use the power of our far-reaching platforms and emerging technologies to better anticipate what our consumers want and deliver them a more seamless and more personalized entertainment experience. We are executing against these priorities, and results clearly speak for themselves. Looking across the Company over the past quarter, we are pleased with the trajectory we are on as we continue to grow our businesses, despite the challenges presented by the ongoing everchanging COVID-19 pandemic. We ended the third fiscal quarter in a strong position, with adjusted EPS up tenfold to $0.80 compared to $0.08 last year. At our Parks, Experiences and Products business, we\u2019re encouraged by some of the positive trends we\u2019re seeing, and new developments we have been hard at work on, including the brand-new Avengers Campus at Disney California Adventure, where guests can team up with their favorite superheroes in thrilling ways. At our international parks, Shanghai is celebrating its fifth anniversary this year with great fanfare, and we welcome the first guests to our reimagined Marvel themed hotel at Disneyland Paris. Meanwhile, work continues on a wide array of new experiences, including the one-of-a-kind Star Wars themed Galactic Starcruiser at Walt Disney World. And as part of a multiyear transformation of EPCOT, we\u2019ll soon introduce our extraordinary new nighttime spectacular Harmonious. Last month, we completed our first cruise since the start of the pandemic with the Disney Magic, which is currently sailing short-term staycations for UK residents. And the Disney Dream set sail on its first U.S.-based cruise this week. Future bookings for all of our ships remain strong, with bookings in the third quarter in particular, having benefited from the announcement of our fall 2022 itineraries and the successful marketing launch of our fifth ship, the Disney Wish, which will set sail in summer of 2022. As our parks business continues its recovery and we see demand grow, we are now putting into action some of the amazing guest-centric services that we have been developing over the last few years. These include Magic Key, our recently announced new annual pass membership program at Disneyland. It provides great value and a variety of options for our guests, and will be available starting on August 25th. The reaction to the news from fans has been extremely positive. Additionally, we\u2019ve made significant investments in sophisticated technology and tools, creating a revolutionary new multi-tiered service, we\u2019re calling Disney Genie, that will enable our guests to more easily and efficiently navigate everything our parks have to offer. We\u2019re very, very excited about this new service, and we\u2019ll be providing additional detail soon. The goal of Disney Genie, which will appear in a user-friendly app, is to create a better, more personalized and customized experience for guests, putting them in control and providing even greater flexibility and choice. They\u2019ll be able to spend less time waiting in line and figuring out what attractions or dining options are available, and more time having fun. On the direct-to-consumer side, we are extremely pleased with the continuing success of our portfolio of streaming services. Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu have performed incredibly well with 116 million 14.9 million and 42.8 million subscribers, respectively, for a total of nearly 174 million subscriptions. Numerous breakout hits from our beloved brands, including Pixar\u2019s Luca and Marvel\u2019s Loki and the Falcon and the Winter Soldier have contributed to strong engagement and new subscriber growth in core Disney+ markets. And we have continued to launch Disney+ in new markets around the world, including Disney+ Hotstar in Malaysia and Thailand in Q3. Disney+ is also currently available in a limited capacity in Japan and will expand to the full market in late October, followed by additional APAC markets, including South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong in mid-November. The launch of Disney+ in Eastern Europe has moved from late 2021 to summer of 2022, primarily to allow for an expanded footprint that will include parts of the Middle East and South Africa. Additionally, we\u2019re excited about the launch of Star+ throughout Latin America later this month. As we\u2019ve said, our direct-to-consumer business is the Company\u2019s top priority. And among our unique advantages in promoting and growing our DTC service are our powerhouse brands and the vast array of direct consumer touch points we have across our businesses, from our media networks to our theme parks to our consumer products. This synergy enables us to raise consumer awareness and further increase engagement with our streaming services. And the power of this synergy will be on full display on November 12 when we celebrate Disney+ Day with an unprecedented Company-wide cross-promotional campaign. Our robust pipeline of content continues to fuel growth, and we have an incredible lineup of new programming for Disney+. On Thanksgiving Day, we are thrilled to be premiering the first of Peter Jackson\u2019s highly anticipated six-episode Beatles documentary, Get Back. We also have exciting new series from Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic coming later this year, including Marvel\u2019s Hawkeye, starring Jeremy Renner and Hailee Steinfeld; The Mandalorian Spin-Off, The Book of Boba Fett and National Geographic\u2019s, Welcome to Earth with Will Smith. With respect to our current approach to distributing our feature-length films, last year, in light of the prolonged and unpredictable nature of the pandemic, we needed to find alternative ways to bring our movies to consumers while theaters were closed. And once they began to reopen, there was still widespread reluctance to return. Therefore, we adopted a three-pronged strategy for releasing our films that consisted of theatrical releases, direct to Disney+ and a hybrid of theatrical plus premier access as we did with Cruella, Jungle Cruise and Marvel\u2019s Black Widow, the top-performing film at the domestic box office since the start of the pandemic. Both, Bob Iger and I, along with the leaders of our creative and distribution teams, determined this was the right strategy because it would enable us to reach the broadest possible audience. And just to reiterate, distribution decisions are made on a phone by phone basis based on global marketplace conditions and consumer behavior. We will continue to utilize all available options going forward, learn from insights gained with each release and innovate accordingly, while always doing what we believe is in the best interest of the film and the best interest of our constituents. We have an incredible slate of upcoming theatrical films, starting with Free Guy which premiers tomorrow, followed by Marvel\u2019s newest action adventure, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings on September 3rd. The highly anticipated live-action musical, West Side Story from Steven Spielberg, is set for December as is the Kingsman, a prequel in the popular Kingsman series. We have Disney Animation Studios\u2019 Encanto, an incredibly heartwarming story set into magical town in Colombia and featuring music by the incomparable Lin-Manuel Miranda. Our Marvel slate includes four feature films in fiscal 2022, the all-new Eternals, alongside sequels to Doctor Strange, Thor and Black Panther. A brand new Indiana Jones Adventure starring Harrison Ford, is due in the summer, as is the origin story of another Intrepid Explorer in Lightyear, a spin-off of the beloved Toy Story franchise. It\u2019s a widely appealing slate with something for everybody. Our goal is always to provide guests and consumers with unparalleled entertainment, whether they\u2019re visiting one of our parks or watching one of our films in a theater or on our streaming platforms. And as we continue our recovery, we believe we are taking the right steps to further this goal while growing our businesses and increasing shareholder value. Personally, I am as optimistic as ever about the future of our Company. We have a robust and growing portfolio of DTC services powered by the world\u2019s best storytellers and greatest brands and franchises, and the parks business, which extend those stories and creates a place where magic comes to life in a more guest-friendly way than ever. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Christine and she\u2019ll talk in greater detail about the quarter and the way ahead.\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter was $0.80, an increase of $0.72 from the prior year quarter. I\u2019ll walk through our results today by segment, starting with Parks, Experiences and Products where we continued to benefit from improvements and recovery at our parks and resorts as well as at consumer products. Segment operating income at DPEP in Q3 increased by $2.2 billion year-over-year. At parks and experiences, we continued to benefit in the third quarter from the reopening of our sites around the world. Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were both open for the entire third quarter. Whereas in the prior year quarter, Walt Disney World was closed for the entire quarter, and Shanghai Disney was open for 48 days. Hong Kong Disneyland and Disneyland Paris were open for 72 days and 19 days, respectively, in the third quarter versus 10 days and zero days in the prior year quarter. And Disneyland Resort was opened for 65 days during the third quarter and was closed for all of the prior year quarter. At Walt Disney World, third quarter attendance levels were generally at or near our daily capacity levels, which increased throughout the quarter. Disneyland Resort also steadily increased attendance and capacity following its reopening at the end of April and particularly after the lifting of California state restrictions on June 15th. Guest spending at our domestic parks has been exceptionally strong, with third quarter per cap up significantly versus fiscal 2019 at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland. Guest spend has benefited from pent-up demand and favorable guest mix, driving higher admissions per cap as well as from spending on products related to Star Wars, Galaxy\u2019s Edge and Avengers Campus. Looking forward, theme park reservations at both of our domestic parks remain strong, and we continue to utilize our yield management strategy to deliver the optimal guest experience and provide flexibility to our guests during these dynamic times, all while driving economic margin for our shareholders. At consumer products, improved results year-over-year were driven by growth at both our merchandise licensing and retail businesses. Growth in merchandise licensing was primarily due to higher revenue from merchandise, based on several of our key franchises, including Mickey and Minnie, Star Wars, including the Mandalorian, Disney Princess and Spider-Man. The increase in retail was due to higher results at Disney stores, most of which were closed in the prior year quarter as well as a comparison to the impairment of store assets in the prior year quarter. Moving on to our Media and Entertainment Distribution segment. Third quarter operating income decreased by about $1 billion versus the prior year as improved results at direct-to-consumer were offset by declines at Linear Networks and Content Sales/Licensing and Other. At Linear Networks, operating results were lower at both, our domestic and international channels. At domestic channels, both cable and broadcasting operating income decreased in the third quarter versus the prior year. The decrease in operating income at cable was due to higher programming and production costs and higher marketing costs, partially offset by higher advertising and affiliate revenue. As we called out last quarter, the increase in Q3 programming and production costs was due to the return of live sports at ESPN, driven by the NBA and Major League Baseball. In the prior year quarter, a significant number of live sporting events were canceled or delayed due to COVID-19. At broadcasting, lower results from the ABC television network were only partially offset by growth at our owned television stations. The decrease at ABC was largely due to higher programming and production costs, partially offset by higher advertising and affiliate revenue. The increase in programming and production costs was due to an increase in the average cost of programming and the shift in timing of the Academy Awards, which aired in the third quarter compared to the second quarter in the prior fiscal year. Domestic advertising revenue increased year-over-year at both, cable and broadcasting, driven by favorable comparisons versus the prior year due to COVID-19. At cable, the increase was driven by ESPN, where third quarter advertising revenue increased by $400 million versus the prior year, reflecting the return of live sporting events. Q4-to-date, domestic cash advertising revenue at ESPN is currently pacing above prior year. But bear in mind that this comparison is complicated by various COVID and timing impacts from the prior year. We\u2019re not going to provide a forecast for the quarter, but the underlying sports ad marketplace remains strong for us, particularly in the quarter in which the Olympics were held. At broadcasting, higher advertising results were primarily driven by increased rates and the timing of the Academy Awards, which benefited both, the owned television stations and ABC. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased 4% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of 8 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Results at international channels declined due to higher programming and production costs, partially offset by higher advertising revenue. Both of these factors were impacted by the return of live sporting events and in particular, the Indian Premier League, which held cricket matches from April 9th until the season was postponed on May 4th versus no matches in the prior year quarter due to COVID-19. Turning to Direct-to-Consumer. Q3 operating income improved by over $300 million versus the prior year, driven by Hulu, partially offset by a higher loss at Disney+. The increase at Hulu was due to growth in subscription and advertising revenue, partially offset by higher programming costs related to Hulu Live. Hulu ended the third quarter with 42.8 million paid subscribers, up from 41.6 million in Q2, inclusive of the Hulu Live digital MVPD service. Paid subscribers to Hulu Live decreased slightly to 3.7 million from 3.8 million at the end of Q2. At Disney+, operating results decreased versus the prior year due to higher programming and production, marketing and technology costs, driven by the ongoing expansion of the service. These higher costs were partially offset by increased subscription revenue, reflecting subscriber growth and increases in retail pricing as well as Premier Access revenue for Cruella. Note that Disney+ Premier Access revenue is included in our DTC operating results but is excluded for the purposes of calculating ARPU. As Bob mentioned earlier, we ended the third quarter with 116 million global paid subscribers to Disney+, up from approximately $104 million in the second quarter. Disney+ Hotstar accounted for the majority of our net subscriber additions between Q2 and Q3, making up a little less than 40% of our total Disney+ subscriber base as of the end of the third quarter. However, subscriber growth was also solid at our core Disney+ markets, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, with total quarter-over-quarter net adds in those markets consistent with net adds from Q2. Disney+\u2019s overall ARPU this quarter was $4.16. Excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $6.12 or an increase of about $0.50 versus the second quarter, reflecting a benefit from the recent price increases, both domestically and abroad. Disney+ Hotstar ARPU also increased from Q2 to Q3 due to higher ad revenue per subscriber, reflecting the roughly four weeks of IPL matches that were played in Q3 versus none in Q2. At ESPN+, operating results in the quarter were comparable versus the prior year. ESPN+ ended Q3 with 14.9 million paid subscribers, reflecting over 1 million net subscriber additions versus the second quarter. Content Sales/Licensing and Other operating income at DMED decreased in the third quarter versus the prior year due to lower home entertainment and theatrical distribution results. The decrease in home entertainment results was due to lower unit sales of new release titles, reflecting the performance of Raya and the Last Dragon and Soul in the third quarter compared to Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Frozen II, Onward, Call of the Wild, and Ford v. Ferrari in the prior year quarter, along with lower catalog sales. The decrease in theatrical distribution results was primarily due to higher marketing expense for future releases and lower operating income from titles in release. Looking ahead, there are a handful of items I would like to mention, as you think about our fourth quarter. At Linear Networks, we expect fourth quarter operating income to decline versus the prior year, reflecting incremental marketing and programming costs at ABC and FX, in addition to an adverse comparison to last year\u2019s benefit from the 53rd week. The increase in marketing and programming expenses at ABC and FX is driven by more than twofold increase in the number of series premieres versus the prior year quarter as productions in the prior year were impacted by COVID. As it relates to the 53rd week, recall that last year, we estimated a benefit of approximately $200 million to the Company, which primarily impacted our Linear Networks. At Content Sales/Licensing and Other, we are expecting an operating loss in the fourth quarter, driven by a number of items, including higher marketing and distribution costs in the theatrical window due to more titles being released versus the prior year, in addition to lower results from home entertainment and third-party content licensing. We now expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 to be approximately $200 million lower than our fiscal 2020 CapEx of $4 billion due to lower spending at our domestic parks and resorts, partially offset by increased spending for facilities across the enterprise and technology for our DTC services. And finally, in light of the ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as our continued prioritization of investments that support our growth initiatives, the Board decided not to declare or pay a dividend for the first half of fiscal 2021. Longer term, we do anticipate that both, dividends and share repurchases will remain a part of our capital allocation strategy. However, for the time being, we don\u2019t anticipate declaring a dividend or repurchasing shares until we return to a more normalized operating environment and our leverage is back to levels more consistent with a single A credit rating. And with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Lowell, and we would be happy to take your questions.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks, Christine. And once again, as we transition to the Q&A, let me note that since we are not physically together this afternoon, I will do my best to moderate the Q&A by directing your questions to the appropriate executive. And with that, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: Our first question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. Lowell, I\u2019ll let you choose the speakers, but here are the questions. One is, I wanted to understand how the Company is thinking about near-term theatrical releases, given the steep fall-off in second week box, rise of the Delta variant, international markets still not opened. So why not delay or pause release schedule? And then, secondly, on DTC profits, I guess, more Hulu profits, it looks like continually they\u2019re getting better than expected. I think you turned profitable this quarter with Hulu. So, I\u2019m wondering why that improvement and why not revisit maybe some of the guidance that we shared earlier on DTC profitability, just given the continual improvement in it looks like Hulu profitability? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Michael, thank you for those questions. I\u2019ll turn the first one over to Bob and then Christine can address the Hulu profitability question.\nBob Chapek: Michael, as you probably recognize, we live in a very uncertain world in terms of the recovery of some of our markets in the theatrical exhibition world. It\u2019s certainly part of that. We\u2019ve said from the very beginning that we value flexibility in being able to make as last-minute calls as we can, given what we see in the marketplace. And certainly, when we planned our schedule that we\u2019re executing right now, we did not anticipate, nor did I think anybody, the resurgence of COVID with the Delta variant that would have such a significant impact on the marketplace. At the same time, when you work in an ecosystem, having a lot of partners, they need to be able to plan their business, too. And so, at some point, we have to put a stake in the ground and say, for example, Shang-Chi, that\u2019s going to be a title that we\u2019re going to put in the marketplace or Free Guy, that\u2019s going to be a title that we\u2019re going to put into the marketplace. Not knowing, again, three months earlier when you make that commitment, what exactly the marketplace is going to look like. But, what I do think that says, Michael, it says that we value flexibility and we value to follow where the consumer is going to go. And while some of that\u2019s uncertain, I think, in terms of relative to where the rest of the market is, you see that we\u2019ve got more flexibility in terms of how we program. And nothing is in stone because the marketplace is rapidly changing. But at some point, you\u2019ve got to put a stake in the ground and say, this is what we\u2019re going to do. And that\u2019s where we ended up on Shang-Chi and Free Guy, which are our next two titles out.\nMichael Nathanson: Bob, can I just follow-up? Why wouldn\u2019t you just add from your access, given what you saw happen, I think, successfully with Black Widow to those two titles?\nBob Chapek: Okay. Good questions. On Free Guy, obviously, this is a title that we acquired under a different distribution assumption and set of agreements. So, we don\u2019t have the degree of freedom to do that on Free Guy. On Shang-Chi, we think it\u2019s actually going to be an interesting experiment for us because it\u2019s got only a 45-day window for us. So, the prospect of being able to take a Marvel title to the service after going theatrical with 45 days will be yet another data point to inform our actions going forward on our titles. But once again, I\u2019ll refer back to my previous answer. When we planned Shang-Chi, that title was planned on being in a much more healthy theatrical environment. And at this point, unfortunately, due to distribution agreements that we have and due to just the practicalities of last-minute changes, it wouldn\u2019t be possible.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks.\nChristine McCarthy: I\u2019ll take your question on Hulu, Michael. You\u2019re absolutely correct. Hulu exceeded our expectations, and it was profitable this quarter. There\u2019s a couple of things going on here. One is, it has had -- continued to have subscriber growth and also very strong advertising revenue. The advertising is coming from higher sell-through rates, a lot of addressable advertising and a significant ramp-up in the dynamic ad insertion technology that we have within Hulu Live. So, those are things that are driving it. And at the same time, they are just like all of our other streaming services, they\u2019re ramping up their production, programming and also marketing expense to promote those new shows. So, we\u2019re very pleased with what\u2019s going on at Hulu, but we\u2019re not going to update our guidance yet because we are in the process of doing our fiscal \u201822 annual operating plan. And if we feel that we have to update it after we complete that, we will certainly do it.\nMichael Nathanson: Thank you, guys.\nLowell Singer: And Michael, thanks for the questions. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAlexia Quadrani: My questions are on the parks side, if I can. I guess, the first one is, we\u2019ve seen really, really much improved results this quarter. And moving forward, I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re seeing any recent impact from the Delta variant in the domestic or international parks may be cause for concern, particularly as you\u2019re increasing capacity. And then, just staying on the parks, maybe you can elaborate on how we should view sort of longer-term profitability, given the improvements you\u2019re able to make in terms of automating many aspects of the parks during COVID or while they were closed. But now, maybe with heightened cleaning expenses perhaps staying for a while and other expenses related to COVID staying for a while, given how this variant has continued to kind of make COVID still very much part of our lifestyle. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: All right. Alexia, thanks for the question. So Bob, maybe you talk about Delta\u2019s impact on parks and you may want to talk about leading in Alexia\u2019s second question, some of the yield stuff we\u2019ve been doing. And Christine, you probably want to follow-up on the second part.\nBob Chapek: Okay. In terms of impact of the Delta variant, we see strong demand for our parks continuing. And the primary noise that we\u2019re seeing right now are really around group or convention cancellations. In other words, large groups that are coming in relatively short-term. But on the whole, we see really strong demand for our parks. In fact, our park reservations now are above our Q3 attendance levels. And as you just saw with our earnings announcement, our Q3 attendance levels were pretty darn good. So, we\u2019re still bullish about our park business going forward. I may also suggest, as a bridge to the second question that we\u2019ve implemented a reservation system that\u2019s going to enable us to spread our demand, increase our yield and improve our guest experience at the same time. And in terms of the long-lasting impacts that you mentioned, I think some of the cost implications that we need to do for hygienic purposes are going to be relatively short-lived. And frankly, in the grand scheme of operating our parks, not all that material. But what will be the long-lasting impact is the improvements that we\u2019re making with guest personalization and guest choice, therefore, affecting the tremendous yield benefits that we\u2019ve been able to extract over the last few quarters. And that\u2019s only going to grow in the future with our ability to really do world-class yield management systems through our new reservation system.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi Alexia. And I\u2019d add to that a couple of things. One is, we have seen very, very strong per caps in addition to all the yield management things Bob mentioned. But the per caps, in my comments, I referred to them as exceptionally strong. And I would not use that word were it not for the fact that they were exceptional. Last quarter, I said that they were up strong double-digit and this quarter was even stronger. If you look at - when a park is closed for a long period of time, as Disneyland was, as Paris was, when they reopen, the per caps really shoot up. And we still have, even though Walt Disney World isn\u2019t open now for over a year, we\u2019re still seeing extremely strong per cap growth continue at that park. So, in addition to all the technology things that we\u2019re implementing, as Bob mentioned, reservation systems, the dining apps, we\u2019re just seeing the consumer behavior be very favorable. And the guest experience is something that we\u2019re going to be focused on, especially as we continue to reopen.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Alexia, thanks for the questions today. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you. Good afternoon. A couple probably for Christine. Christine, I was wondering if you could give us the Hulu advertising growth in the quarter. I think, you\u2019ve given that to us in prior quarters. And then, also, just are you expecting the IPL to come back in September at this point? And any update on the Latin American sports situation, since that\u2019s part of your launch there. And then, if I can ask Bob a parks question just on technology. You mentioned the Disney Genie. How substantial of a sort of an improvement or evolution in the guest experience are you expecting to bring to market? And then MyMagic+ is pretty -- it\u2019s been around for a while. And I\u2019m just wondering if you think there\u2019s a real transformation ahead for the business as you take advantage of the last year-plus of downtime to reinvent the experience? Just maybe add some context would be helpful.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Ben, thanks for the questions. Thank you, Ben. I think, we\u2019ll start with, Bob, if you want to talk a little bit about some of the technology at the parks, and then we\u2019ll go to Christine to talk about Hulu ad growth, IPL and LatAm.\nBob Chapek: Okay. Ben, you used the correct word, transformational. MyMagic+ was us basically sticking our toe in the pond of this type of transformational work. Disney Genie though is that program on steroids. This is going to revolutionize our guest experience. Guests are going to spend less time waiting and more time having fun in our parks with a dramatically improved guest experience. That\u2019s going to make their navigation of their day and their planning of their day much easier. Essentially, what it\u2019s going to do is take the consumer preferences that we know from our consumers, given what we know from them, and blend that with basically industrial engineering data that we\u2019ve got in terms of how our park is operating that day and meld those together to make suggestions on the fly that not only will lead to that improved guest experience, but at the same time lead to substantial commercial opportunities as the guest navigates their base. So, it certainly qualifies in my mind for both materiality and transformational impact on our business from a yield standpoint.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. Ben, I\u2019ll try to go through your -- hope I can remember them all. So, Hulu. Hulu did have very strong advertising growth in the quarter, and we continue to see that growth quarter after quarter. We haven\u2019t specifically quantified it, but I would say that it is driven by higher impressions as well as rates. And as I mentioned, the ability for us to use the dynamic ad insertion in Hulu Live is also a benefit. I think, the advertising sales team, if they had more inventory, they could certainly sell it. There\u2019s that much demand for it. Just to put some context around it, because I think it\u2019s a precursor of what the upfront showed is that the -- we came out of a very strong upfront but we had about 40% of the total upfront dollars into streaming and digital. And a lot of that is not only across Hulu, but also across our other entertainment and sports platforms. So, I think that just shows that the kind of advertising that\u2019s going through Hulu is certainly a growth driver. The IPL is coming back. It\u2019s scheduled to come back on September 19, and it will run through, I believe, the last final match is scheduled for mid-October, around October 15. When you think about Disney+ Hotstar, IPL is certainly a very, very important component of the offerings, but it\u2019s only one because we also have a very broad portfolio of general entertainment as well as other sports. It has a lot of original content, library content in it from all of the Disney+ brands and IP. And we added over 18,000 of original local programming every year. So, we feel really good about not only the IPL but also Star -- Hotstar+. In LatAm, we will be -- LatAm, the launch for LatAm is in later this quarter. But I don\u2019t have any updates to anything new on the sports side.\nOperator: Next question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse.\nDoug Mitchelson: So, two questions. It\u2019s certainly nice to see the U.S. parks profitable in fiscal 3Q. And I note that operating expenses are back at 81% of 2019 fiscal 3Q levels, while revenues about 60% of 2019 levels. And that seems consistent with commentary that you made in the past that you have to ramp overhead in advance of consumers coming back to the park. So, my question is, is the overhead now sort of re-ramped at the Parks? Should we look at this as the right overhead level? And from here, it\u2019s variable cost growing with consumers continuing to come back, and that\u2019s how we should think about modeling the parks going forward? And then, the second area is just on streaming. I hope you could discuss the health of Disney+. How was engagement trending in the quarter? How was churn playing in the quarter? What was the impact of Star as you merged in with Disney+ in Europe? And anything else you want to note on the health of Disney+ would be appreciated. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Doug, thanks for the questions. Bob, you may want to start on the streaming question, and I don\u2019t know if you want to make some comments on kind of parks\u2019 cost ramp. And then, Christine, you may want to jump in on that as well.\nBob Chapek: Okay. In terms of the health of Disney+, we feel really great about our sub trajectory. We\u2019ve got world-class content from the world\u2019s best storytellers, plus our international launches, plus the power of the Disney bundle. And you asked the question about churn. We\u2019re really pleased with churn. We\u2019ve taken some price increases over the past few quarters. And what you\u2019re seeing is that our churn has declined, including in Latin America where we went up -- I mean by -- in Europe, sorry, by \u20ac2 when we added Star brand as a sixth brand tile. So, our retention is very healthy across the globe. We\u2019re really, really pleased with that. And I think, again, it really goes back to the price value that we\u2019re offering our guests. When you take out Luca, Loki, Falcon and the Winter Soldier. There\u2019s something essentially new each week. You blend that together with a tremendous local investment that we\u2019re making in our international territories. And it\u2019s really a price value proposition that is really great. So, the fact that our churn is so low, our engagement is so high, our retention is so high amongst the local corridors where we\u2019re taking price increases, I think, says everything about it. In terms of -- and I\u2019ll start this off, Christine, on the cost side and what we expect to see in terms of our parks profitability. But right now, you can use a lot of different metrics to look at our business. In California, we\u2019ve got all three of our hotels open, for example. We\u2019ve got 70% of our available rooms open in Walt Disney World. So, you can see that we\u2019re not quite 100% available at this point. But, I think that a lot of the costs from here on out are variable. Obviously, as we scale our business and we get up closer and closer to 100% capacity, our efficiencies and operating become much, much higher. So, I think you\u2019ll see disproportionate benefit as we go from here on. Christine, I don\u2019t know if you want to elaborate.\nChristine McCarthy: Yes. I would just add that our parks -- our plan -- and once again, this is -- we\u2019ll monitor the trends with what\u2019s going on with the Delta variant. But, we\u2019re expecting to have our parks domestically be fully staffed up by the end of this calendar year, calendar 2021. And we\u2019re going to be increasing capacities as we have the demand, and we\u2019re also being able to train -- thoroughly train our employees as they come back in. And once again, this is an ever-changing landscape with COVID, but we\u2019re going to be particularly careful, and we\u2019re also going to bring our capacity online aggressively, but measured. We\u2019re not just going to open up the doors and flung them open. So, we\u2019re doing this in a measured fashion for the health and safety of not only our guests, but also our cast members in the parks.\nLowell Singer: Doug, thanks for the questions. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: The next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich of Bank of America.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thanks. I have one on Disney+ and one of film. You mentioned that you\u2019re opening in Japan, fully opening in Japan in October. It\u2019s such a big country with a huge affinity for everything Disney. I mean, the Parks are doing really well there, and it\u2019s a very affluent country. So, just wondering if you could give us any color on market size and ARPU. And then, on film, the industry has undergone such massive change over the last two years towards streaming. But obviously, the pandemic has had a big impact, but it was moving in that direction anyway. With the jury out on like how much the box office will come back to pre-COVID levels, how do you think about the success of a film in today\u2019s environment? And how does that impact the way you attract talent, the way you compensate talent? And what changes do you expect to make, if any, in your film strategy from here?\nLowell Singer: Okay. Jessica, thanks a lot. Bob, why don\u2019t you take the film question? I don\u2019t know if you want to make any comments on Japan? And Christine, you may want to jump in on that one as well.\nBob Chapek: Okay. Obviously, this world has been disrupted by COVID, and we\u2019re all reacting to a very fluid situation in terms of the marketplace. We\u2019re very grateful for the fact that we had the ability to take out a lot of titles, both not only in the theatrical marketplace for those that prefer to watch a film that way, but also at the same time through our Disney Premier Access, and that was a winning strategy for us to give consumers the choice for those that decided that going back to a theater was not for them at the same time. That said, these films, Jessica, were really conceived under a time when we did not know what was going to be happening with consumer behavior three, four years later and certainly didn\u2019t know about COVID at the time. So, we\u2019re dealing under a different sort of set of conditions than we thought. What I will say is that just like we\u2019ve done many times before, as the business has evolved and transformed, we\u2019ve figured out ways to fairly compensate our talent, so that no matter what the business model is that we have to go to market with, everybody feels satisfied. And I will say that since COVID has begun, we\u2019ve entered into hundreds of talented arrangements with our talent. And by and large, they\u2019ve gone very, very smoothly. So, we expect that, that would be the case going forward. Certainly, this is a time of anxiety the marketplace as a lot has changed recently. And again, these films that we\u2019re releasing right now were imagined under a completely different environment than unfortunately, the fate has delivered us. But, we\u2019re trying to do the best thing for all our constituents and make sure that everybody who\u2019s in the value chain, if you will, feels like they\u2019re having their contractual commitments honored, both from a distribution and a compensation standpoint. What I\u2019ll say before I turn it over to Christine on Japan is that remember that heretofore, as we\u2019ve launched Disney+ around the world, in Japan, we\u2019ve done it with a fairly limited distribution system and that\u2019s about the change going forward. But at the same time, that market is under, as they call it, a state of emergency. And that certainly has disrupted that marketplace as we go from a fairly limited distribution now to a much more broad distribution. Christine?\nChristine McCarthy: Yes. Jessica, we fully agree with your assessment of the market and the high degree of affinity that the Japanese market has for Disney IP. So, we\u2019re totally agreeing. We did, as Bob say, a soft launch with a partner last year, but it was only to a small part of the market, and we\u2019re really excited to do the full launch that will be in this coming October for Disney+. And we\u2019ll see how that goes, but we have been very cautiously optimistic as we always are, but we believe that that IP is going to resonate. We don\u2019t, as you know, break out ARPU by individual markets. So, we\u2019ll just be giving you the Disney+ ARPUs the way we currently are doing it.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jason Bazinet of Citi.\nJason Bazinet: So, I think your digital pivot is incredible, impressive. But I want to ask a question that will come across as bearish and it\u2019s really not. It\u2019s an honest question. I think in the salad days of pay TV, maybe we had, I don\u2019t know, 75%, 80% pay TV penetration and people who were paying U.S. households $70 a month or something. And the most mature SVOD platform out there is probably at 50% penetration with ARPUs that are sort of one-fifth of pay TV ARPUs and not really growing. And I just wonder what -- if you guys have any thoughts on what that means for the broader sort of digital pivot? And are there things that the industry needs to do as an example, if you think it\u2019s tethered to piracy or something like that that could sort of give you another -- or the industry, including you another leg of growth in terms of net adds that people aren\u2019t thinking about? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: So, Bob, do you want to take that? Thanks, Jason, for the question, by the way.\nBob Chapek: Jason, I\u2019d like to think of it like we\u2019re in the first inning of the first game of a very long season. We\u2019ve not even been at this right now as Disney, at least for two full years. Despite that two full years, as you suggested, we\u2019ve gone into 61 countries in 21 months. So, we\u2019re very proud of that and we\u2019re proud of the success that we\u2019ve had. I would caution not to come to any conclusions about the size of the market. We\u2019ve got a TAM of 1.1 billion households across the globe. And we\u2019ve only just begun our journey. And as I think you see, what\u2019s really going to make the difference for Disney is our spectacular content told by the best storytellers against our powerhouse franchises. You put that in the context of also all the local investments that we\u2019re making. And I think we\u2019re going to have a bright future ahead. And I understand the benchmark that you\u2019re using, but I think this is a different marketplace. And I think we\u2019re charging forward to maximize the opportunity, given our unique combinations of not only distribution platforms, but intellectual property and storytelling.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman: Earlier, Bob, you were talking about the power of the Disney bundle. And in the U.S., you\u2019ve really taken a bundle-centric approach to the market. I was hoping you can give us some insight into that power. Whatever you can share to help us understand, why the bundle is so successful, either the portion of your subs, Disney+ subs that are in the bundle or the portion of the gross adds or engagement, whatever you can offer would be great. And then, just expanding on that a little bit, if the bundle really does appear to be the most compelling product in the portfolio, why not just make it the core product and eliminate the complexity to the consumer in terms of thinking about which elements of the Disney entertainment ecosystem they want and just give it all to them at once? Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Brett, thanks for the questions. I\u2019ll turn them over to Bob.\nBob Chapek: Okay. In terms of the bundle, you see that the majority are not -- maybe not the majority, but a good chunk of our marketing now is going towards a bundle. And that\u2019s because the -- while we enjoy extremely low churn rates on our individual services, the churn rates on the bundle are even lower, surprisingly low even for us. And I think what that says is that our customers enjoy the price value of the bundle that we offer and getting an incredible amount of content for a really good price. While I can\u2019t comment on some of the specific percentages that you\u2019re probably looking for, but I will make a comment on sort of going forward. You noticed that across the world, we\u2019ve got different business models. We\u2019ve got different business models for two reasons. Number one, the unique situation that we find ourselves in each market whether it\u2019s Europe or LatAm or Asia or North America tend to be different in terms of what rights we have and what the consumers are actually looking for. But that also gives us an opportunity to test out different propositions. Obviously, the proposition that we have in Europe with Star as a 6-brand title looks significantly different than our relatively unbundled approach that we have in North America. Again, we\u2019re in the first inning of the first game of all the long season, and we\u2019re taking all this into account. There may also be certain constraints that were under that could, at least from a short-term standpoint, limit our ability do what long-term we might feel was ideal. But frankly, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s ideal yet. I will say that we\u2019re extremely pleased in every market that we\u2019ve launched our direct-to-consumer services. We\u2019ve exceeded our expectations in every marketplace. So, in terms of the way that we\u2019ve approached the market so far, it\u2019s worked really, really well. Is there an opportunity for improvement by considering something different going forward? Possibly. But, we\u2019re going to continue to learn. And as we learn, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll refine our offerings in the marketplace, as time goes on.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks, Brett, for the questions. Operator, given the time, I think we will take our final question.\nOperator: Sure. Our final question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.\nJohn Hodulik: Maybe the 2024 guide, I think, included 30% of subs coming from Hotstar. I mean, given the strength in Hotstar, does that guidance still hold? And then, given the content release schedule that we have in the second half of the year, do you expect the net add trends in what I\u2019d call the core Disney+ markets to improve in the back half? And then lastly, just anything you could tell us on just Disney+ Day in November in terms of how you expect to promote? Is it global or U.S. or just -- or any new content that could be launched that day, anything you could tell us on that would be great?\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks, John, for the question. Bob, why don\u2019t you start on Disney+ Day and then Christine, you can take the question about Hotstar guide, et cetera.\nBob Chapek: Okay. Disney+ Day will be a balanced approach between global and local product. We\u2019re going to have a real exciting lineup, as you might guess, as we approach those consumers who have not yet signed up for Disney+ with a really attractive group of titles to be announced. But, I think it gives us an opportunity to provide a focal point for consumers that have not yet tripped over to Disney+. And I think it\u2019s going to give us a focal point of excitement and energy that will not only pay benefits in the U.S., but globally as well. In terms of the net add question and how that\u2019s going to improve, first half versus second half, again, we feel really great about our sub trajectory. As we learn, though, we\u2019re finding out there\u2019s tremendous seasonality in this business that we may not have known about before we really got into it, or at least in terms of above expectations. Also, I want to caveat that our sub adds aren\u2019t necessarily going to be linear. I think a lot of the marketplace expects these things to sort of be a straight-line math, and it\u2019s not really turning out that way. And as we\u2019ve indicated before, we do believe our first half adds this fiscal year will be stronger than the second half adds. That said, we really feel great about our trajectory. Christine, do you want to take it from there?\nChristine McCarthy: Sure. And I would just add one thing on the Disney+ core markets. In this third quarter, when you exclude Disney+ Hotstar, we saw solid sub growth quarter-over-quarter net adds consistent with what we saw in the previous quarter. So, we feel really good about the continued growth in our core markets. And on Hotstar, at Investor Day, we said that we anticipated Hotstar to be between 30% and 40% of total Disney+, and we\u2019re not updating that guidance at this point.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks for the question. And I want to thank everyone for joining us today.

Welcome to The Walt Disney Company's Second Quarter 2021 Financial Results Conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nLowell Singer: Good afternoon, and welcome to The Walt Disney Company's second quarter 2021 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and a transcript will be available on our website. We are once again hosting today\u2019s call remotely. So joining me remotely are Bob Chapek, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we'll be happy to your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob, and we well get started.\nBob Chapek: Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. It's been a busy few months and we've been pleased to see more encouraging signs of recovery across our company. We ended the second fiscal quarter with adjusted EPS of 32% to $0.79, compared to $0.60 last year. And since then, we've continued to make progress across our businesses as we remain laser-focused on our ongoing recovery, while also fueling long-term growth. Our strategic focus continues in three key areas. First is direct-to-consumer. We successfully launched our streaming offerings, Disney+ and Star, in a number of markets internationally. And we've been pleased with the growth and engagement in those markets to date. Our steady cadence of new high-quality branded content, along with our robust collection of library titles, allows us to continually attract new subscribers and retain existing ones. At the same time, we are also closely monitoring the recovery of theatrical exhibition, as consumers begin to return to theatres, and I'll talk more about the specifics later. Finally, we are focused on the ongoing recovery of our parks business and the resumption of Disney Cruise Line. There have been some encouraging developments in recent months, particularly with the ongoing rollout of the vaccine and the gradual lifting of government mandated restrictions. And through this time, we've taken advantage of the opportunity to make improvements to our operating procedures to enhance the guest experience through the use of technology innovations, new ticketing strategies, and other offerings. We are especially excited that after being closed for 412 days, we welcomed our first guests back to Disneyland two weeks ago and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Bob and I stood on Main Street USA on opening day, and it was so wonderful to see the joy on our cast and guests' faces and feel the excitement in the air. It's been fantastic to see cast members back at work. Most recently at Disneyland, we were able to quickly recall more than 10,000 furloughed cast and retrain them to be able to operate to the State of California's new health and safety requirements. We continue to see strong growing demand from consumers as we are at or near our reduced capacity levels at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland for the current quarter. It's clear our guests are excited to get back to experiencing the magic of Disney and they also have extraordinary confidence in our safety protocols. At Shanghai Disney Resort, where they just kicked off their year-long 5th anniversary celebration, the park is operating at or above FY 2019 levels. We're also encouraged by what we're seeing at Hong Kong Disneyland, and we are hopeful we will be able to announce a reopening date for Disneyland Paris soon. Despite the pandemic, we continue to make progress on a number of highly anticipated projects at our parks around the world, including the all new Avengers Campus, which is set to open at Disney California Adventure on June 4. I had a chance to visit recently and the attractions and multiple state-of-the-art experiences are truly phenomenal. We recently unveiled our newest cruise ship, the Disney Wish to the public with a virtual live stream presentation that has been viewed nearly 1.2 million times. The ship is amazing and it includes the AquaMouse water ride, the first ever Disney attraction at sea. The Disney Wish will set sail on its maiden voyage in 2022 and bookings open to the general public on May 27. On the studio side, we are pleased to be nearing full production levels, and we are also significantly ramping up content creation at our studios consistent with the guidance we provided at Investor Day. An example of this is 20th Century and Searchlight Pictures, where they are gradually increasing output and will reach a steady state of 15 and 20 films, respectively, to fuel our general entertainment offerings across all of our distribution platforms. We're incredibly proud that Searchlight's Nomadland took home Oscars for best actress, best director, with Chlo\u00e9 Zhao becoming the first woman of color to win the award and best picture. That's five best picture wins since 2009 and 43 Academy Awards in total. Additionally, Pixar's stellar record of award-winning films continues with the Studio's animated masterpiece, Soul, which took home Oscars for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Score. And I'm happy to say that now millions are able to enjoy Soul on Disney+ and Nomadland on Hulu. As we have consistently stated, flexibility is a key component of our distribution strategy. And we have outlined three approaches for distributing our films. Releases in theatres with a simultaneous offering via Disney+ Premier Access releases straight to Disney+ and traditional exclusive theatrical releases. Here's how this translates to our tremendous upcoming film slate. Cruella will be released in theatres and via Disney+ Premier Access on May 28, followed by Pixar's Luca, which will be released exclusively at Disney+ on June 18. The highly anticipated Black Widow will be in theatres and on Disney+ via Premier Access on July 9, and Disney's Jungle Cruise, hilarious adventure filled expedition, will be available in theatres and on Disney+ via Premier Access on July 30. I'm pleased to announce today that amidst recent signs of increased consumer confidence in movie going; two films, 20th Century's exciting comedy, Free Guy; and Marvel's action adventure, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, will be released with a 45-day exclusive theatrical window on August 13 and September 3, respectively. And of course, regardless of where they originate, all of our films and episodic series will end up as part of the robust library of content on our DTC platforms. Like our films, our Disney+ original series have become must-watch events. Starting with the success of The Mandalorian followed by Marvel's WandaVision and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. These not only became immediate hits, but part of the cultural zeitgeist. And the anticipation for Marvel's newest series, Loki, which debuts on June 9 has been through the roof. The second season of High School Musical, The Musical, The Series, the all new The Mysterious Benedict Society based on the popular young adult book series, and the animated series Monsters at Work are also coming to Disney+ in the next couple of months, just to name a few. We are uniquely positioned with the most compelling brands and franchises in entertainment. And we continue to deliver the high-quality, one-of-a-kind content that consumers want. That's clearly reflected in the success of Disney+, which amassed nearly 104 million paid subscribers as of the end of the second fiscal quarter. We are on track to achieve our guidance of 230 million to 260 million subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024. Looking at our entire portfolio streaming services, we expect that as full production levels resumed and we get to a more normalized cycle, the increased output will help fuel additional sub growth across Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu and Hotstar. Hulu and ESPN+ had 41.6 million and 13.8 million paid subscribers, respectively, at the end of the quarter. On Hulu, buzz-worthy content continues to boost performance, including the award-winning Hulu original film, the United States vs. Billie Holiday, and Season 4 of The Handmaid's Tale, which premiered to the biggest audience ever for a Hulu original. And there's lots more coming to Hulu, including Marvel's new animated series, M.O.D.O.K.; Season 2 of the hit series, Love, Victor; and Season 10 of the wildly popular anthology, American Horror Story on FX on Hulu. In March, we launched ESPN+ on Hulu and we are very pleased with its early progress. Viewers who subscribe to both Hulu and ESPN+, are able to watch and engage with the great content that's available on ESPN+ without leaving the Hulu environment. ESPN+ programming includes thousands of live sporting events, original shows, series and documentaries with the UFC lightweight Championship by airing live on ESPN+ pay-per-view on May 15. The final match of the FA Cup also on May 15, followed by the PGA Championship, Wimbledon, and the highly anticipated third UFC matchup between Dustin Poirier and Conor McGregor on pay-per-view, July 10. Not to mention the incredible additions to our lineup, including NHL and more college football in the fall. Live sports are a very important component of our content business. And even admits the challenges of the past year, we have continued to build our unrivalled portfolio of sports rights in a disciplined way. While our overall strategy is still very supportive of our linear business, given the important economic value address for the company, we're also building out our ESPN+ direct-to-consumer offering and with every deal we make, we are considering both the linear and DTC components. With this strategy in mind, we've reached a number of long-term accretive deals that each play a very specific role as part of our sports portfolio. Some are weighted more towards linear with a significant digital component, such as the NFL and SEC deals, others reflecting an emphasis on direct-to-consumer. These include agreements with the UFC, the PGA Tour, Bundesliga, and the NHL. For example, as part of a 7-year rights deal with the NHL, 75 of the leagues live National Games will be available exclusively on ESPN+ and Hulu. And ESPN+ will be the sole home for more than 1,000 out of market NHL games, further submitting the service as a must have for hockey fans. And today, I'm excited to announce two additional sports rights deals. We've reached a renewal deal through 2028 with Major League Baseball with 30 exclusive regular season games, which include 25 Sunday night baseball games, and opening night annually. Coverage of the highly anticipated potential expanded Wild Card Series and the option to simulcast all live MLB coverage from ESPN networks on ESPN+. We've also signed a historic rights agreement with the top division in Spanish club football, La Liga. La Liga is one of the world's best and most popular soccer leagues, including a number of the top clubs in the world, and one of the best players in the world, Lionel Messi. And this 8-year deal, covering both English and Spanish language rights, brings 380 La Liga matches and a host of La Liga two matches per season to ESPN+, beginning in August. And this deal bolsters ESPN+'s position as a top destination for soccer in the U.S., offering fans more than 2,900 matches per season. When you combine the unparalleled assets of the Walt Disney Company, ESPN, ESPN+, ABC and Hulu, plus our highly engaging digital and social content, it's clear that Disney is the absolute leader when it comes to serving our sports fans in the most effective way possible. We believe in the power of live sports, and are confident our multi-platform rights deals we've made will provide us tremendous value now and into the future. Overall, we are pleased with the encouraging signs of recovery across our businesses, and we are confident we continue to move in the right direction for our future growth. And with that, I'll now turn it over to Christine and she'll talk more in depth about our results for the quarter.\nChristine McCarthy: Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the second fiscal quarter increased 32% versus the prior year to $0.79 per share. We are beginning to see progress in many of our businesses after more than a year of adverse impacts from the pandemic. While we are not out of the woods yet, we are pleased with our results this quarter at both our DMED and DPEP businesses. I will walk through our results by segments, starting with Media and Entertainment Distribution. Operating income at the segment increased by 74% in the second quarter versus the prior year, due to higher results across all of the segments lines of business. At Linear Networks, the increase was driven by growth at both our domestic and international channels. At domestic channels, both cable and broadcasting operating income increased versus the prior year. Higher results at cable were driven by lower programming and production costs and higher affiliate revenue partially offset by lower advertising revenue. ESPN's results were in line with the guidance we gave last quarter, and ESPN was the most significant contributor to cables growth this quarter. The decrease in programming and production costs was largely due to the timing of the College Football Playoffs. As we mentioned last quarter, fiscal Q2 included only one CFP Bowl game, the National Championship compared to four in the prior year quarter, three CFP Bowl games and the national championship game. Cable programming and production costs also benefited in the quarter from lower production costs for other live sporting events and lower programming costs at Freeform. Lower advertising revenue at cable was primarily due to lower average viewership. At ESPN, domestic advertising revenue decreased significantly in the quarter driven by lower ratings for key programming, in addition to the timing of the College Football Playoffs. Quarter to date, domestic advertising revenue at ESPN is currently pacing up significantly versus last year, benefiting from the prior year's lack of significant live sports programming due to COVID. At broadcasting, higher results were driven by growth at ABC, partially offset by a decrease at the owned television stations. At ABC, lower programming and production costs and higher affiliate revenue were partially offset by lower advertising revenue. Programming and production costs were impacted by the shift in timing of the Academy Awards, which took place in the third quarter this year compared to the second quarter last year. Lower advertising revenue was primarily driven by lower average viewership and the timing of the Academy Awards partially offset by higher rates. On our Q1 earnings call, we said we expected the Academy Awards timing shift and lower political advertising at our own stations would negatively impact broadcasting results in the second quarter versus the prior year. While we did see those specific adverse impacts play out, overall broadcasting results were higher than we expected, driven by lower marketing spend due to timing shifts of some new series, in addition to a number of other smaller factors. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased 5% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of 8 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Operating results at international channels increased due to a decrease in programming and production costs and an increase in advertising revenue, partially offset by lower affiliate revenue. Lower programming and production costs in the second quarter were driven by a higher percentage of content cost being allocated to our DTC business rather than our networks business as we continue the international expansion of Disney+ and Star, in addition to channel closures over the past year. Advertising revenue increased primarily due to the timing of BCCI cricket matches, which generally take place in the first quarter, but were in the second quarter this year due to COVID related timing shifts. Lower affiliate revenue at our international channels was due to channel closures as well as an unfavorable foreign currency impact. At our direct-to-consumer businesses, operating results in the quarter improved by over $500 million versus the prior year due to stronger results at Hulu, and ESPN+. The increase at Hulu was due to subscriber revenue growth and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by higher programming and production costs related to the Hulu Live TV service. Hulu ended the second quarter with 41.6 million paid subscribers, up from 39.4 million in Q1, inclusive of the Hulu Live digital MVPD service. Paid subscribers to Hulu Live declined modestly to 3.8 million from 4 million at the end of Q1, which we attribute primarily to the $10 price increase we took in December, in addition to a modest impact from seasonality. At ESPN+, improved year over year results were driven by subscriber growth and an increase from UFC pay-per-view events. ESPN+ had 13.8 million paid subscribers as of the end of the quarter. At Disney+, results were comparable to the prior year quarter, as an increase in subscribers was largely offset by higher content, marketing and technology costs. As Bob mentioned earlier, we had almost 104 million Disney+ paid subscribers at the end of the second quarter. At our Annual Meeting, we announced we have reached 100 million global paid subscribers. We reached that milestone in early March. So we added subs at a faster pace in the last month of the second quarter than we did in the first 2 months. And that was despite no major market launches, a price increase in EMEA and a domestic price increase towards the end of the quarter. We attribute this success to the strength of our overall content slate. The launch of the Star general entertainment offering in many markets and the continued growth of Disney+ Hotstar. Between Q1 and Q2, Disney+ Hotstar was the strongest contributor to net subscriber additions, making up approximately a third of the total Disney+ subscriber base as of the end of the second quarter. However, ARPU at Disney+ Hotstar was down significantly versus the first quarter due to lower advertising revenue as a result of the timing of IPL cricket matches and the impact of COVID in India. As a reminder, the majority of the prior IPL tournament took place in fiscal Q1 and there were no games in Q2. The current IPL tournament began on April 9, in fiscal Q3 and was suspended last week, given the COVID situation in India. Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $3.99. Excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $5.61. As we move through the remainder of the year, we should start to see the benefit on Disney+ ARPU from price increases we've taken around the world. Last quarter, we guided to second quarter direct-to-consumer operating income improving modestly versus the prior year. Actual results came in significantly better versus the prior year, due to Hulu advertising sales upside, lower content and marketing expense at Hulu and Disney+ and better-than-expected ESPN+ pay-per-view results. Content sales licensing and other operating income at DMED increased in the second quarter versus the prior year due to higher TV SVOD results and lower content impairments partially offset by lower home entertainment results. Higher TV SVOD results were primarily due to an increase in income from sales of episodic content, driven by sales of more profitable programs in the current period and lower write-offs. This was partially offset by a decrease in sales of film content. The decrease in home entertainment results was driven by the absence of significant title releases in Q2. Moving on to our Parks Experiences and Products segment. DPEP's operating income in the second quarter decreased by $1.2 billion year-over-year as growth at consumer products was more than offset by lower results at Parks and Experiences due to the impacts of COVID-19. Our consumer products growth and operating income was due to increases at our merchandising games licensing businesses. The Parks and Experiences results were again adversely affected by COVID-19 related closures and reduced operating capacities versus the prior year. Disneyland Resort, Disneyland Paris and our Cruise business were closed for all of the second quarter, whereas these businesses closed in mid-March of the prior year quarter. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was opened for approximately 30 days during the second quarter, compared to approximately 25 days in the prior year quarter. Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were both open for all of Q2. In the prior year quarter, Disney World closed in mid-March and Shanghai closed in late January. Our parks and resorts that were opened during the quarter operated at significantly reduced capacities yet all achieved the objective of a net positive contribution, meaning that revenue exceeded the variable costs associated with opening. At Walt Disney World attendance trends continued to steadily improve throughout the second quarter, and guest spending per capita again grew by double-digit versus the prior year. Disneyland Resort reopened on April 30, and as Bob mentioned earlier, we are very encouraged by the initial guest response. Forward looking bookings for park reservations at both of our domestic parks are strong, demonstrating the strength of our brands as well as growing travel optimism as Case counts decline, vaccine distribution ramps and government restrictions loosen. Looking ahead, there are a couple of items I would like to mention. At Linear Networks, we expect a significant decline in operating income year-over-year in the third quarter, largely due to higher sports programming and production costs at ESPN, which we expect to increase by $1.2 billion versus prior year. This year's Q3 includes marquee events, such as the NBA, Major League Baseball, The Masters, Wimbledon, and the European Football Championship, which compares to Q3 of last year during which we had a limited slate of events due to COVID. At our direct-to-consumer business, we now plan to launch Star Plus, our standalone general entertainment and sports streaming service for Latin America on August 31. Moving the launch to late summer allows us to leverage a strong sports calendar, which includes the return of European soccer leagues, including La Liga, and the Premier League. Championship games for the Copa Libertadores, the prominent regional international soccer competition, along with Grand Slam tennis. As Bob mentioned earlier, we remain right on track to reach our fiscal 2024 guidance of 230 million to 260 million subs, powered by the addition of 30 million paid Disney+ subs in the first half of the year. And notwithstanding our expectation for fewer net sub adds in the second half of the year, given the COVID related suspension of the IPL season, and our decision to move the Star Plus Latin America launch to the fourth quarter. We remain very optimistic about our future. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Lowell and we would be happy to take your questions.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks, Christine. And as we transition to the Q&A, let me note once again that since we are not all physically together this afternoon, I will do my best to moderate by directing your questions to the appropriate executive. And with that, operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe just starting on the direct-to-consumer side, for -- maybe for Bob, could you talk a little bit about how the price increases have landed relative to your expectations, both internationally with Star, but also in the U.S kind of the impact on churn and how that might inform your decision-making process going forward on price? And then I just wanted to ask, I think you guys generated maybe $700 million or so of free cash flow in the quarter. Normally, we don't talk a lot about quarterly free cash flow. But it's been a while, I\u2019m just wondering, Christine, if you think at this point, we're back in free cash flow positive mode going forward and expect to generate free cash flow for the year. Thank you both.\nLowell Singer: Okay, Ben. Thanks for the questions. Bob will take the first one on price response, and then Christine will take the cash flow question.\nBob Chapek: All right. Of course, these were our first price increase since we launched. I have to say that we're extremely pleased with how the market reacted to both. In the U.S., we've not observed any significantly higher churn rate since the price increased in EMEA. As we added Star as a six-brand title, we've actually seen an improvement in our churn rate. So we seem to be fairly resilient to those price increases. And as such, I think it makes us feel relatively bullish going forward that we still offer a tremendous price value relationship across the world for Disney+.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, Ben, and thanks for the free cash flow question. We don't usually get those. But I would like to comment on it because it's something that we're tracking not only this year versus last year, we look at it actually weekly. But I'm also looking at it versus fiscal 2019, which I consider a more normalized year. I would say that the upside that we're really seeing and we're quite pleased with it is since we've reopened Walt Disney World, and we really don't have the impact of Disney Land yet, but we're seeing, as I mentioned, a strong per cap growth in the parks that's flowing through the parks cash numbers, and we're also seeing good strong cash flow from our direct-to-consumer businesses. So those two elements are kind of upside to what we had planned for. And I would also say that the -- there is some choppiness year-over-year, because of some of the shifts and sports rights expense timing from last year to this year. But we expect that to be more normalized this year as we get through the year. But we're looking at a more favorable free cash flow than we did when we started off the year.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks a lot.\nLowell Singer: Ben, thank you. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. One on streaming as well and then one on the parks. How should we think about really Disney+ subscriber growth going forward? I know you gave a lot of great color in terms of how to think about the cadence for the balance of the year. And details on the growth we've seen so far -- on the impressive growth we've seen so far. But I'm wondering, if you look at what you see internally as major drivers for the step up, or step up until you get to your long-term target, is it really around certain content drops? Is it around eventually moving more into Eastern Europe or other markets in Asia? I guess what do you guys see is sort of the main drivers for sub growth? And then just a follow-up, if I can, on the parks. Any color you can provide on how we should think or how you're thinking about when it's okay to start raising capacity, attendance capacity, particularly at Walt Disney World.\nLowell Singer: Okay, Alexia. Thanks for both questions. Bob, do you want to take both of those?\nBob Chapek: Yes, I'll take them both. So on the first one, in terms of the drivers for sub growth going forward, we really see four different elements. First of all, is our content slate. As you know, we're spending a lot of money across our variety of franchises in order to create the content that's going to keep consumers coming back and keep not only our sub number growing, but also our engagement growing across all of our platforms. So the first one is content slate. The second one is our general entertainment international growth driven by our Star brand. And we think that's going to continue to fuel growth for international territories as well as Disney+. The third one is continued market expansion in markets where Disney+ has not yet been launched. And as you see, we're announcing in Malaysia today as June 1, and Thailand as June 30. So market expansion will continue to be a piece of it. But one thing that continues to impress us is the opportunity to have the bundle in the U.S be even larger. All the metrics that we see, all the performance factors are extraordinarily positive for that. So I would say those are the four components that continue to drive us and our bullishness in terms of our ability to continue to project that we're going to hit between 230 million and 260 million subs by the end of 2024. In terms of the parks, and when we're going to sort of be able to raise our capacity limits, we've actually already started that, given the guidance that just came today from the CDC, and earlier guidance that we got from the Governor of Florida, we've already started to increase our capacities. Those - obviously, today's guidance that we got from the CDC in terms of those that were vaccinated do not necessarily need to wear masks anymore, both outdoors and indoors, is very big news for us. Particularly, if anybody's been in Florida in the middle of summer with a mask on, that could be quite daunting. So we think that's going to make for an even more pleasant experience. And we believe that as we're now bringing back a lot of people back to work, that it's going to be an even bigger catalyst for growth in attendance. And we've been quite pleased to date. So I think you're going to see an immediate increase in the number of folks that were able to admit into our parks through our reservation systems that we recently implemented. So we're very, very excited about that.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. Well, I have two. One is on the gross addition side of Disney+. We heard from Netflix that may have been a pull forward and maybe perhaps the reopening is impacted gross additions. Can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in some of the more mature or I guess develop markets on the gross addition side? And then you guys have consistently beat us OI profits, or lack of losses, I'd say, on DTC. Which of the platforms is providing the biggest surprise? And does it make you rethink maybe some of the guidance you gave around breakeven, given how strong the year has been so far on limitation of losses? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: Bob, why don't you start and then we'll go over to Christine.\nBob Chapek: Okay, I'll take the first one. In terms of the additions, we've really seen it across our geographies. When you look at it from a mature versus new, every single market that we've launched in has exceeded our expectations so far in terms of the new. But in terms of mature, keep in mind that we added 30 million households in the first six months of the fiscal year, which is in line with our expectations, and domestic continues to contribute to that. The addition of the Marvel content and not only the Marvel content, but how strong it's been and the cadence of additions, and as you know, we'll soon be announcing our -- soon be launching Loki. That is a tremendous catalyst for growth for us. And in the future, as we get to more new content and serial content coming from Star Wars, we're really, really encouraged by what that's going to mean in terms of engagement, because as you know, engagement is sort of the precursor for net sub adds. And so we're very pleased with both our domestic as well as our, let's call, more mature markets, those that we've been in the marketplace for at least a year, but also our new markets as well.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. And I'll take the second part of your question, Michael, and nice to hear your voice. Look, the biggest drivers for direct-to-consumer were coming out of Hulu and Disney+. They're a little bit different. Disney+, we saw some lower content costs and that was due to some lower allocated costs for some of our own titles compared to what we had expected. And at Hulu, there was also some lower content costs, but for a different reason. It was from their third-party content that is coming -- that were delayed because of some COVID issues. So content coming in is not coming in as quickly as that they had thought, but the most important driver for Hulu is the addressable advertising strength. That continues to be a real upside. And it's going strong, and we expect that to continue. There's real demand for that addressable advertising.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks, Christine.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Michael \u2026\nMichael Nathanson: My other question was -- sorry, Lowell. Thanks.\nLowell Singer: Go ahead. Go ahead, Michael.\nMichael Nathanson: And does that make you rethink your guidance on breakeven timelines, given how strong Hulu has been?\nChristine McCarthy: No.\nMichael Nathanson: No.\nChristine McCarthy: The only guidance that we have reaffirmed was the 2024 total Disney+ global subs. Bob mentioned it, I mentioned it, that 230 million to 260 million. All the other guidance we have not reaffirmed or changed at this point. We're still going through our long-term planning cycle. So we're not making any changes now.\nMichael Nathanson: Okay. Thank you, Christine.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with BofA Securities. Your line is open.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thanks. I\u2019ve just the same, parks and DTC. Some of the pictures from the parks look like it's totally full even with this reduced capacity. So now with capacity increasing, how does that relate to like kind of normal attendance? Even though you don't have international visitors, it still feels like from what we can see that it's fairly full. And you said demand strong. I just wonder if you can comment on that. And also, any update you can give us given the strong demand, how that overlays with some of the things you've talked about in the past and didn't really discuss today, but the yield management, some of the cost changes you've put in place. And then, sorry for such a longwinded question, but given the tight labor market, are there any issues that you're seeing there either on the cost side or in hiring? And then finally on DTC, I mean, this lower net adds in second half, sounds like it's coming from India, which of course is understandable, given IPL as well as COVID. But there's also likely to be an impact on ARPU, a positive impact on ARPU and I'm just wondering, how does it all translate into the operating results OI?\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Jessica. So, Bob, why don't you take the parks questions? And then if you want to start on the Disney+ question, Christine, may want to jump in at the end.\nBob Chapek: Okay. So in terms of the parks demand domestically, our intent to visit at Walt Disney World is growing and is actually already flat with '19, which is obviously our last pre-COVID year. So that's really good news for us. And since we've opened up Disneyland Resort, intent to visit is actually growing as well. So we're thrilled with the guests response to that. So as capacity limits increased, we don't think we're going to have any problem at all, sort of increasing our attendance to match that capacity, that is not something that keeps any of us up at night. In terms of our yield management, as you know, we've been practicing yield management for a while. And it's really become an art form with this extraordinarily limited capacities that we've been operating yet. But you've seen the margins very healthy, our yield is growing up. From a very healthy standpoint, consumers are spending more, and we're doing it under some tremendous cost management parameters, because everything's become automated. And so we've sort of got the perfect positive storm, if you will, where we've got plenty of demand, we've got really great yield management gains and the cost management at the same time. And in terms of labor, we've had about 80% of our cast members return that we've asked to return. And obviously one of the gating factors for us to continue to increase capacity is to continue to get a more and more cast members back, it thrills us to be able to do that. But we've had no problems whatsoever in terms of trying to get our cast to come back and make some magic for our guests.\nLowell Singer: Christine? I think you\u2019re muted.\nChristine McCarthy: I'm going to talk about -- hi, Jessica. I'm going to talk about direct-to-consumer and the slower net adds expected for the second half of the year. That is, in fact the case. And it is largely due to the COVID related suspension of the IPO. And also that decision that we made to move the Star Plus Latin America launch into the fourth quarter. And once again, we did that because of the strength of the sports calendar that we would have upon launch. The other thing that's going to happen here is with the absence of the IPL games in India, that will also have an impact on advertising revenue. So you could see a decrease in the ARPU and the subs in India, if that plays out, like we just said. But the other thing is we did take price increases for domestic U.S as well as EMEA for Disney+, so our overall ARPU could benefit. So we just took the price increase in the U.S at the end of March. And we'll see how that plays out in our ARPU in the upcoming quarters.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Thank you, Jessica. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. Thanks for taking the question. So, Lowell, I would say sort of two areas of focus. The first you started touching on it a bit with the last series of questions, but I think one of the core thesis is that coming out of the pandemic, it's potential that the parks at Disney are more profitable than pre-pandemic. And you've talked about some of those drivers, one of them perhaps, when the parks returned to 100% of capacity, is that capacity different than it was pre-pandemic? Is it bigger? Are you smarter on pricing? Are margins structurally higher? So, one, I was just curious if you agree with that thesis at the parks could end up being more profitable coming out of the pandemic than it was going in? And then the second area, the NFL deal was obviously super interesting. And I'm curious under what circumstances would you consider doing what some peers are doing, simulcasting your football games, Friday Night football games from either ESPN or ABC onto ESPN+? Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Doug, thank you. Thanks for the questions. I will turn both of them over to Bob.\nBob Chapek: Okay. In terms of park, and in terms of the relative profitability, as you know, we have -- there's a lot of negative impacts, of course, with COVID. But one of the things that it gave us a chance to do as we were forced to stop operation was to completely reexamine how we priced and programmed our tickets. And as you all know, we ended our current annual pass program at Disneyland. And that gives us a chance to sort of create a modern version of a park loyalty program and affinity program that isn't necessarily governed by legacy. And as you know the net contribution back to the company varies tremendously, and was one of the levers that we use to grow yield over the past several years, depending on what type of ticketing structure a particular guest came in. With the ability now for us to sort of completely reconsider how we go about our loyalty programs and our frequent visitor programs, we have the chance to make even more advancements, not only in terms of the guest experience and make sure that guests have a tremendous experience, no matter what day of the year they come, whether it's a high demand day, or a relatively low demand day, but also the ability to increase our per caps and our yields. And we've already seen tremendous growth in those as you're seeing over the last couple quarters. But I don't think we've even scratched the surface in terms of what we can do when we finally restart with some of our programs, in terms of making sure again, that not only do we improve the guest experience, but at the same time get an adequate return to our shareholders for the type of experience that we do give to our guests. So very positive on those factors. In terms of the ability to simulcast with ESPN+ and ESPN and ABC, that's actually been envisioned in the deals and we've gotten a lot of flexibility, not only in terms of our ability to take our programming to our DTC platforms, and things like Hulu and ABC. So that's actually been envisioned and we plan on being fairly aggressive in that way. I think that one of the advantages of The Walt Disney Company in sports is that we've got so many ways to reach our consumer base. And I think the league's understand that and we certainly do as well, and I think our guests do as well.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Thank you, Doug. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Your line is open.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. So a couple, if I could. I mean, firstly, I guess, Bob, when you look at the vision for sports streaming, you now have digital rights across all the major sports that you carry on ESPN. And you've made some hard choices on the other businesses when it comes to licensing, and studios and so on in order to pivot -- make a hard pivot for streaming. But that choice with respect to sports streaming feels like it's still a couple of years off in terms of pivoting ESPN as a business completely towards streaming. So could you just talk about the longer-term vision now that your sports portfolios in place? How should we think about ESPN relative to ESPN+ and how you're thinking about the transition being accretive overall? And secondly, I guess, Christine, the guidance around the second half cadence for DTC subs. The IPL suspension, I guess could change. I think they're looking at other geographies to run the tournament. If that was to happen, would the outlook change for subscriber growth in the second half? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Kannan, thanks. Bob, I'll hand the sports question to you and then Christine, you can talk a little bit about IPL impact on subs.\nBob Chapek: We've talked a lot about -- excuse me, we talked a lot about flexibility when it comes to pivoting between linear and more traditional legacy platforms, and our digital rights direct-to-consumer platforms. And the reason we want that flexibility is because we know things are going to change. And as we've always said, when the right time comes for us to make a step function increase, as we've done with our entertainment platforms to our sports platforms and it's accretive to our shareholder proposition, we'll go ahead and do that. Our longer-term vision is to parallel path both ESPN and ESPN+, but if there's any indication of where we're going with this, I think our recent deals and the flexibility that we've negotiated in to go to these direct-to-consumer platforms and specifically ESPN+ or whatever follows ESPN+ in terms of the direct-to-consumer platform, I think that's 100% indicative of our bullishness of not only our capability of doing that, but the viability of doing that.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, Kannan. And your question around if they move the IPL. About half of the 60 IPL matches that were expected to be played this season have already taken place. So you're looking at the back half 30 games to be played. So sure if they were able to successfully relocate the tournament, we would hopefully see an impact, especially on advertising. And so there would be a positive what we're expecting. It would be better than if there were no rescheduled. The big issue is going to be when in the quarter and if it overlaps into Q4, or if it goes into the first fiscal quarter, which starts for us and the beginning of October. So it would have a -- it would have an impact on it, it just depends on when it would come in. So let's hope they are able to relocate it.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Got it. Thank you, both.\nLowell Singer: Hey, Kannan, thanks for the questions. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thank you, guys. Maybe keeping with the sports rights question, it does look like you guys are sort of bulking up on sports rights. Would you say you still have demand for additional rights, if the economics made sense and I think thinking sort of Sunday Ticket or the EPL? Or is there sort of a level that you get to in terms of spending where you feel you need to cut it off? And then given all the rights and the digital platform, are -- is the sports gambling become a bigger opportunity for the company and something that you expect to go deeper into? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: John, thank you. Bob, do you want to take those?\nBob Chapek: Yes, thank you. In terms of the sports rights, we've just recently closed MLB, La Liga, NFL, NHL. So we certainly as you have suggested have a full complement of sports to please almost anybody. And you take that in addition to the NBA rights that we have and yes, we're -- we've got a full house there. In terms of our appetite for going further, in terms of what's really left, there's not much, you mentioned Sunday ticket and that's something that we're in conversations with and we're considering and we're thinking about it. Obviously, it's an attractive property, but we'll only do it just like our other rights, if it is something that adds shareholder value. And that's the filter that we'll continue to look for. And we're really happy with, frankly, the deals that we've got in terms of representing things that are accretive to our shareholders so far. And we'll take that same approach going forward. In terms of the gambling opportunity, as you know, we stuck our toe in this water in the last couple of years in terms of sports links with a few of the players out there. And I think going forward, we see this as an opportunity. We seized an opportunity, we know that it represents very little risk to the company and very little risk to ESPN. As a matter of fact, it's actually -- it builds the brand equity from the research that we've had in terms of some of the younger audience that follow sports because it's such an integral part of the experience. And so we think it's actually a growth vehicle for us, but we'll walk into it carefully and monitor it carefully, but we have a greater appetite to do more and more in that area.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Thanks, Bob.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks, John. Operator, we have time for one more question today.\nOperator: We have a question from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrett Feldman: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned during your prepared remarks, the three primary ways you look to release theatrical content, whether it's in the theatres or on your direct-to-consumer platforms. And one of those methods is a simultaneous release in the theatres and Premier Access. And I can understand during COVID, when it was very unlikely that people would be in theatres, but that was a reasonably easy call. It seems like this could be a little trickier to make a decision around when a film has the right characteristics for that type of release model going forward. So I was hoping you can maybe give us an insight in terms of what you're weighing when you make that decision. And in particular, with your big franchises, for example, you'll be doing this with Black Widow. What gives you conviction that you can build and nurture and create a lot of enthusiasm around those mega franchises without at least some limited theatrical window. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Thanks, Brett. Bob, do you want to take that?\nBob Chapek: Yes, I'm going to take the second one first. If there's any marker in terms of our ability to continue to build franchises, we know theatrical is a proven way to do that. But our merchandise sales on Mandalorian that never had a theatrical release is certainly one extraordinary marker in terms of the fact that while theatrical continues to be a great way for us to build franchises, our first big data point using our Disney+ platform to sell merchandise has been extraordinarily successful for us as well. In terms of the Premier Access, you're absolutely right. As we get into a situation where we're trying to monitor our consumers ready to go back into theatres, of course, 90%, let's say of the domestic marketplace is open right now. And we're encouraged in terms of polling in terms of that growing going forward. But if you look at last weekend's box office for an example, and you compare it versus an average over the last 3 years of pre-COVID box office, it was 85% below domestically and 63% below -- 67% below internationally. So we know the markets not quite there yet. So the Disney Premier Access strategy, one of the things that gives us right now, and we're grateful for this is the ability to go ahead and try to release things into the market and try to reprime the pump, if you will. But at the same time, know that for those consumers that are a little leery still about going into a packed theatre, that they can go ahead and watch it in the safety and convenience of their home. In terms of going beyond this fiscal year, we've not announced exactly what our strategy is going to be in terms of which titles will be theatrical plus Disney Premier Access, which ones will be direct to Disney+, or which ones will go into theatres. But know that we'll continue to watch the evolution of the recovery of the theatrical marketplace. And we'll use that flexibility to make the right call at the right time. But right now, we've only called those films that are in this fiscal year because of the relatively fluid nature of the recovery of exhibition.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Brett, thanks for the question.

So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob, to get started.\nBob Chapek: Thanks, Lowell, and hello everyone. I hope, you're all doing well and staying safe. Unfortunately, as you know, the COVID pandemic continues to present significant hurdles, for businesses and communities across the US and globally. And most important, it has taken a tragic toll, on way too many lives. Fortunately, there have been some encouraging developments, particularly with the availability of the vaccine. And we're pleased to be doing our part, by providing space at Disneyland for one of Southern California's major vaccine distribution sites. To-date more than 100,000 doses have been administered at our location. It's hard to believe nearly a year has passed since the start of the pandemic, which continues to negatively impact the operations of our company. For the first quarter, adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.32 a share, compared to $1.53 a share last year. Christine will talk more in-depth about our results for the quarter. During this difficult time we have made significant changes while finding new and innovative ways to conduct our businesses. But at the same time, we have chartered a course for an even more deliberate and aggressive DTC push for Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu and Star. I'm really proud of how well our team has performed, in the face of a multitude of ongoing challenges, both creatively and across our parks and experiences, and legacy and DTC distribution platforms. We've been especially pleased with the success of our direct-to-consumer business. And our recent strategic reorganization has enabled us to accelerate the company's pivot, towards a DTC-first business model and further grow our streaming services. Disney+ has exceeded even our highest expectations, in just over a year since its launch with 94.9 million subscribers, as of the end of the first fiscal quarter. ESPN+ and Hulu have also performed well, with 12.1 million and 39.4 million subscriptions, respectively. And on February 23rd, we will be launching our new international general entertainment offering Star, across Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. Star will offer thousands of hours of movies and television from the company's multiple studios, including content from our acquisition of 21st Century Fox, along with Star-branded exclusive originals and local programming, tailored to specific markets. Star will be integrated into Disney+, as a distinct sixth brand tile. And will offer easy to use, parental controls to manage access to the content available on Star. We're less than two weeks away from launch and we're seeing tremendous excitement amongst consumers. As you saw during our Investor Day presentation, we've got an amazing robust pipeline of original content in development and production, for our full portfolio of streaming services. We have some of the best creative teams in the business. And that's reflected in the tremendous appeal, of our unparalleled programming. In just the last two months, Disney+ has delivered a string of hit programs, including Marvel's incredibly original WandaVision, season two of The Mandalorian which ended with the surprise reveal that fan favorite Boba Fett will have his own Disney+ series starting this December; and Pixar's artistic triumph Soul, which debuted on the service and in theatres on Christmas Day to great acclaim and has since taken in nearly $100 million at the global box office. The wealth of IP from our unrivaled collection of brands and franchises provides us with an incredible breadth and depth of storylines and characters to mine for Disney+ and our other streaming services. We have the ability to interconnect these storylines and characters in unprecedented ways as we saw with The Mandalorian and WandaVision tying into the broader Star Wars and Marvel franchises. We're excited to continue exploring the endless possibilities that this unique ecosystem provides. The fan response was overwhelming when we announced last week that Ryan Coogler who's hard at work on Black Panther 2 will be developing a Black Panther inspired series based in the Kingdom of Wakanda for Disney+. We're also thrilled to be expanding the scope and reach of ESPN's, The Undefeated by creating a destination on Hulu devoted to black entertainment and culture, another example of our continuing commitment and investment in diversity and inclusion, and we can't wait for the award winning and critically acclaimed film, Nomadland, to be released in theatres and on Hulu on February 19th. And on March 5th, Disney Animation Studios Raya and the Last Dragon, an artistically beautiful film celebrating female empowerment will arrive in theatres and on Disney+ via our Premier Access. As we've said our goal is to increasingly put the consumer in charge and let them decide when and how they want to enjoy our one of a kind entertainment offerings. Turning to other parts of the company. We've made a number of changes in how we manage and operate our theme parks and consumer products businesses in light of the disruptions caused by the pandemic. And we believe these and other adjustments we'll continue to make will best position us to operate more effectively now and in a post-COVID environment. Where we have been able to reopen our theme parks with limited capacity, guests have consistently demonstrated a willingness and a desire to visit, which we believe is a testament to the fact that they feel confident in the health and safety protocols we put in place. Average daily attendance at Walt Disney World grew significantly from Q4 into Q1, helped in part by the increased capacity we've been able to achieve as a result of our successful protocols. It's clear that people want to reconnect with loved ones and spend time together doing things they enjoy. And given the demand we're seeing now, we're confident we'll only grow once the pandemic is behind us. Even under difficult circumstances, we've been able to continue expanding our parks. At Walt Disney World Resort we're hard at work on two brand-new attractions at Epcot, Remy's Ratatouille Adventure and the highly anticipated Marvel themed rollercoaster, Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind. Work is also well-underway on the all-new spectacular nighttime show, Harmonious. This is all part of a much larger reimagining of Epcot to make it more Disney, more family friendly, more timeless and more magical. And I'm especially excited about the progress that's been made on the new Star Wars Galactic Star Cruiser hotel at Walt Disney World. People are going to be blown away by the experience. It is truly unlike anything we've done before. At Disneyland Resort the exciting new Marvel themed land, Avengers Campus is currently scheduled to open later this year at Disney California Adventure. And crews are hard at work on the highly anticipated state-of-the-art attraction Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway coming to Disneyland in 2023. We're also moving forward on a number of new projects at our international parks. At Shanghai Disneyland, work continues on the first ever Zootopia themed land. This fully immersive area will seamlessly blend Disney storytelling with advanced technologies, creating a one of a kind experience for our guests. Throughout this challenging period we've consistently demonstrated our ability to deliver world-class programming on all of our platforms, digital and linear. On ABC, we continue to have the number one returning drama in the key demo of adults 18 to 49 with Grey's Anatomy as well as the top new drama of the fall Big Sky. Both Grey's and Big Sky also hold the top broadcast drama spots on Hulu. Also of note, ESPN's first ever NFL Wild Card MegaCast featured six networks including ABC, ESPN+ and ESPN Deportes. It was the most extensive multichannel offering to date for an NFL playoff game. In the following day, the team at ESPN pulled off an equally impressive seat with a MegaCast of the college football playoff national championship game with 14 different presentations on multiple platforms. During an extraordinarily difficult year, our amazing local and national ABC News teams have been doing an absolutely outstanding job. And Good Morning America and World News Tonight with David Muir continue to hold the top spot as the number one morning show and evening newscast. While these remain challenging times, we are more confident than ever that we will emerge from this crisis in a strong position. We're proud of all that we've accomplished, especially as it relates to our top priority our DTC business and we believe that the strategic actions we're taking to transform our company will enable us to enhance the consumer and guest experience, grow and expand our businesses and increase shareholder value. With that, I'll now turn it over to Christine.\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the fiscal first quarter were $0.32. In spite of the challenging circumstances we have faced with COVID over the past year, these results reflect the strength of our brands and experiences as well as our ongoing commitment to operate our businesses efficiently. This is the first quarter in which we are reporting under our new organizational structure. We filed an 8-K last week with the summary recast segment financial information for fiscal 2020. Today's discussion of our financial results will be organized by two segments: Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution or DMED; and Disney Parks Experiences and Products or DPEP. I'll start with our newest segment DMED where operating income increased modestly in the first quarter versus the prior year. Our financial reporting structure for DMED includes three lines of business: Linear networks; direct-to-consumer; and content sales licensing and other. Operating income at linear networks, which now includes both domestic and international channels decreased versus the prior year quarter due to declines both domestically and internationally. At our domestic channels, the decline in operating income was due to lower results at our cable business partially offset by an increase at our broadcasting business. The decrease at cable was largely driven by ESPN where results in the first quarter were significantly impacted by higher rights costs. This was largely due to timing of College Football Playoff games relative to our fiscal periods as well as higher NBA programming costs. The first quarter included 6 CFP bowl games compared to 3 in the prior year quarter. Four NBA finals games were played in the first quarter due to COVID-related timing shifts whereas these games would have typically occurred in the prior fiscal year. ESPN domestic advertising revenue decreased 4% in the quarter due to lower average viewership and the cancellation of certain college sporting events partially offset by an increase in rates. Ad revenue at ESPN is currently pacing down quarter-to-date due in part to the timing of key events. At broadcasting, higher political advertising revenue at our owned television stations drove an increase in operating results versus the prior year, partially offset by a decrease at the ABC television network. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased 3% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of 8 points of growth from higher rates offset by a 5-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. At our international channels, lower results in the quarter were driven by higher programming and production costs and lower affiliate revenue, partially offset by advertising revenue growth and a reduction in non-programming costs. Higher programming costs and higher advertising revenue reflected a shift in the timing of Indian Premier League cricket matches due to COVID. And the decrease in affiliate revenue was primarily due to channel closures.  However, our international channels results this past quarter were better than the guidance we gave in our last earnings call, primarily due to stronger-than-expected advertising revenue, COVID-related timing shifts of non-cricket programming and sports rights costs and expense savings.  Moving on to direct-to-consumer. Improved results at all three of our streaming services drove an improvement in direct-to-consumer operating results of nearly $650 million versus the prior year.  Last quarter, we guided to direct-to-consumer operating income declining by $100 million versus the prior year under our former segment structure. Our reported results are $750 million higher than that guidance.  While some of the outperformance reflects better-than-expected results from Hulu and Disney+ the majority of the variance relates to the elimination of intersegment pricing markups under our new financial reporting structure.  At Hulu, the improvement in the first quarter versus the prior year was due to both subscriber and advertising revenue growth, partially offset by higher programming and production costs. Hulu ended the first quarter with 39.4 million paid subscribers including four million Hulu live digital MVPD subscribers.  Turning to Disney+, a lower loss in the first quarter compared to the prior year was driven by subscriber growth partially offset by higher costs due to the launch and expansion of Disney+. With 94.9 million paid subscribers at the end of Q1, Disney+'s global net additions were 21.2 million versus Q4.  Disney+ Hotstar subscriber additions continued their strong growth trend with Disney+ Hotstar subscribers making up approximately 30% of our global subscriber base. We also saw strong additions to our subscriber base from our November launch in Latin America.  Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $4.03. However, excluding Disney+ Hotstar it was $5.37. Higher results at ESPN+ were driven by subscriber growth partially offset by higher sports programming costs driven by soccer rights. ESPN+ ended the quarter with 12.1 million paid subscribers.  Given that we are past the launch year of Disney+, we no longer intend to update our DTC subscriber numbers as of our earnings dates. But we will continue to provide you with quarter end subs. We may choose to make additional disclosures when we hit certain milestones.  Content, sales, licensing and other operating income at DMED decreased in the first quarter versus the prior year due to lower theatrical TV SVOD and home entertainment results all consistent with our prior guidance. The decrease in theatrical results reflects no significant worldwide releases in the quarter compared to Frozen 2 in the prior year quarter.  Lower TV SVOD distribution results were the result of a shift from licensing to third parties to exhibiting our content on our DTC services. A decrease in home entertainment results was driven by the absence of significant title releases in the quarter compared to the performance of Toy Story 4, The Lion King and Aladdin in the prior year quarter.  I'll now turn to our Parks Experiences and Products segment. We continue to see significant impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic across many of our businesses. While some operations have resumed our Parks Experiences and Products segment has undoubtedly been hard hit by COVID.  In the first fiscal quarter, we estimate the pandemic adversely impacted DPEP operating income by approximately $2.6 billion due to revenues lost as a result of closures and reduced operating capacities. Operating income at Parks Experiences and Products declined significantly versus the prior year to an operating loss of $119 million. As a reminder, Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were open for all of the first quarter. Disneyland Resort was closed and our cruise business was suspended for the full quarter. Disneyland Paris was opened until the end of October or for about a third of the quarter and Hong Kong Disneyland was open until the beginning of December or for about two-thirds of the quarter. Our parks and resorts that were opened during the quarter all operated at significantly reduced capacities, yet all achieved a net incremental positive contribution for the periods during which they were open, meaning that revenue exceeded the variable costs associated with opening. At Walt Disney World, as Bob mentioned earlier, average daily attendance grew significantly from Q4 into Q1, benefiting from typical seasonality factors as well as solid underlying demand trends. At the same time, our operations team found innovative ways to responsibly increase capacity, while still maintaining rigorous COVID protocols. Per caps were also up double-digits year-over-year. We continue to be pleased with the rate of reservation bookings we are seeing in the current quarter and consumer sentiment around visiting our domestic theme parks over a longer period of time remains strong. At our consumer products business, we saw an increase in operating income in the first quarter, driven by an increase in games licensing revenue, which reflects the successful release of Marvel's latest licensed Spider-Man game. As we look ahead, despite continued limited visibility due to the challenges of the pandemic, we would like to give you some context around certain items that may impact our second quarter or full year results. First, at our domestic linear networks, we expect ESPN will benefit in the second quarter from the timing of college football and other sporting events with lower rights costs being partially offset by lower advertising revenue. In Q2, we had only one CFP game which was the National Championship game. This compares to four games in the prior year; three CFP Bowl games and the National Championship game. Our broadcasting business will be negatively impacted in the second quarter due to lower political advertising versus the prior year, in addition to the shift of The Academy Awards to the third quarter. We expect direct-to-consumer operating results in the second quarter to improve modestly versus the prior year quarter as improvement at Hulu and ESPN+ will be partially offset by increased content investment to support the expansion of Disney+. We expect that Walt Disney world attendance in the second quarter will be impacted by typical seasonality headwinds in addition to continued COVID-related headwinds and capacity constraints. Our current expectation is that Disneyland and Disneyland Paris will be closed for the entirety of the second quarter, but we are hopeful we will be able to reopen Hong Kong Disneyland during the quarter. We have refined our capital spending expectations and we now expect CapEx in fiscal year 2021 to be roughly comparable to fiscal 2020 spending. Compared to 2020 we still expect to see increased investment at DMED, in corporate, and reduced spending at DPEP. And with that, I'll now hand the call over to Lowell and we will be happy to take your questions.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Christine, thank you. And we're ready to transition to the Q&A. And as we do that, let me note that since we are once again not physically together this afternoon, I will do my best to moderate the call by directing your questions to the appropriate executive. So, with that Liz, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Our first question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Good afternoon. Bob can you -- I know visibility is limited, but can you tell us how you think about the parks through the rest of this year? In particular, Christine mentioned strong underlying demand. But do you expect to be able to increase capacity limits and fulfil that demand? And as you do, are there things that you've done on the technology or cost side that can help us think about the ramp back to breakeven? And then I was just wondering Christine, is there any way for you to help us think about the sports rights in fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2020. There's been so much movement in a number of games between the two years. And obviously, these are big dollars for the company. I'm just wondering if there's any way you can help us think about that, maybe on an annual basis. Thank you, both.\nLowell Singer: Okay, Ben. Thank you. So Bob, why don't you take the first question about parks and then we'll go to Christine on sports rights.\nBob Chapek: Okay. In terms of the outlook for the parks for the rest of the year and the capacity, it's really going to be determined by the rate of vaccination of the public. That to us seems like the biggest lever that we can have in order to either take the parks that are currently under limited capacity and increase it or open up parks that are currently closed. So that is sort of the gating factor if you will. As Christine suggested, we have ample demand for our parks. Despite everything that's happening with that pandemic, I think we've made a pretty big impression on our consumer base and prospective guests in terms of the safety measures that we've undertaken at our parks to give assurances to people that they should come in and bring their families. And we're very, very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of future bookings. In terms of the cost savings and the technical side of things, not only has our industrial engineering team at Walt Disney World and some of our parks like Shanghai across the world figured out ways to have increased capacity with the same safety measures that we've had in place, which has enabled us to increase our, if you will, our attendance. But there we have been able to substantially manage our cost side at the same time to right-size, if you will, our -- not only our fixed cost base, but also our variable cost base to match what's happening. And I think that's evidenced by what Christine said that all of our parks, regardless of what conditions they're operating under, assuming they are operating, are in positive net contribution side. I would also add you didn't mention this, but I think it's important to add that given those per caps that Christine referenced in terms of the double-digit increase in per caps, this is sort of the ultimate situation where demand has exceeded supply. We've had that -- been fortunate enough to have that situation for the last couple of years and we've learned how to yield this business. And I think this is the ultimate situation where we've got supply greater than demand. So not only working on the cost side, but we're also working on the revenue side. And I think you see some of those results at play at Walt Disney World.\nBen Swinburne: Got it.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. Hi, Ben. Now to address sports rights and the shifting between fiscal years, because of what happened with not only cancellations but delays of some of the sporting events, you will see some doubling up of some sports rights in this fiscal year. Things like you'll have two NBA finals, assuming the season for 2021 continues as we expect. You'll also have things like two Masters, two seasons of IPL games. And this all assumes that in fiscal 2021 nothing is drastically shifted out. But you can expect the sports rights overall to be up, because of the doubling and the shifting into fiscal 2021. And that's on linear. When we look at our ESPN+ rights costs, those are up also because we acquired some additional rights, most significantly in soccer that we announced earlier last year.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you, both.\nLowell Singer: Okay, Ben. Thanks for the question. Operator next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. I have two all. One is on DTC and the learnings from Soul being released directly versus what you experienced in Mulan. Any takeaways there? And maybe what's the right model for you? And then secondly on Hotstar, how important has cricket been to the growth in the adoption there? And is there a risk of churn when the IPL season comes to an end? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: Okay. So, Bob, do you want to take the Soul question? And then, Christine, you might want to take the Hotstar question.\nBob Chapek: Okay. In terms of the DTC business and Soul, as you remember, we took it out on Christmas Day, we thought that was a really nice thing to do for our consumer base and our subscriber base, given the holiday and given the fact that we have talked consistently about remaining flexible in terms of how we're going to go ahead and put our titles out into the marketplace. We were absolutely thrilled by what that brought to our business in terms of both acquisition and retention. And so, I would say, it was a big hit with our subscriber base. In terms of Mulan, I think the best thing I can say about Mulan is that it was successful to the extent that we're also using that strategy on Raya. So the individual decisions that we talked about in the future, in some films we'll take them theatrically and in some films we'll take them theatrically, plus Disney Premier Access as is the case with Raya and was the case with Mulan. And in some cases, we'll take it direct to service. It's going to be dependent, though, on what our slate of titles are and whether we think that we need to put something on the service for those particular guests, or whether this is something that we could use as another data point in our exploration of Premier Access [indiscernible] date with theatrical. So it's really about flexibility and we're going to steer our decision-making over time, given what information that we get from our guests and our subscriber base on what they prefer.\nMichael Nathanson: Okay. And can I just follow-up for a quick second, on Black Widow, which is still I think a May release date? Anything you want to share on potential changes to that release date?\nBob Chapek: Right. So I'm going to go back to the word flexibility, because we had made a reference at the investor conference that Black Widow was going to be a theatrical release and we are still intending it to be a theatrical release. But, again, we are going to be watching very carefully the reopening of theatres and the consumer sentiment in terms of desire to go back to theatres, to see whether that strategy needs to be revisited. But as of now the strategy is to continue on with the theatrical release and we'll be watching very, very carefully. \nMichael Nathanson: Okay. Thanks.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. And I'm going to address the question regarding churn on Disney+ Hotstar, with the IPL season finishing up. So just to put it in context, cricket is a very important part of a diversified programming strategy at Disney+ Hotstar. It also has a lot of other local content that consumers like to view. So we did see a bump up when the IPL season started. But we've also made it economical for a consumer to sign up for a one-year subscription versus going month-to-month. So those are some of the things that we're looking at and utilizing to mitigate the churn that one could expect from IPL, but it's a more diversified offering in terms of programming than just cricket.\nMichael Nathanson: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: All right. Michael, thank you. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Just sort of following up on those comments. On Disney+, can you please discuss, maybe, in general, how you are thinking about local partnerships for content versus more traditional Disney content? I believe, in Indonesia, you leaned a lot more into local content partnerships and you saw outsized growth in that launch there. And I'm curious, sort of, maybe some broader commentary about that mix going forward? And then, my second question is, just sort of following up on your comments on churn. Not necessarily looking obviously for a number on churn, but maybe just some colour about churn in general for Disney+? And how we should think about it in front of the upcoming price increase?\nLowell Singer: Okay. Alexia, thanks. So, Bob, do you want to talk a little bit about local partnership? And then, Christine, you can talk a little bit about churn.\nBob Chapek: Okay. So in terms of the local partnership -- well, first, I'm going to talk about -- I'll talk about the content side, because there was a content side element of it as well. There's really two things that gate our amount of content that's local in any given market, including Indonesia. And in some cases there are local requirements for local content, as a percentage of the total. So that is one factor that plays into it. And then, second one is what we think we need from a portfolio standpoint of overall content. And as you might suspect, we're pretty aggressively ramping up all of our production for all our local territories. In terms of the partnerships, in Indonesia, we're partnering with Telkomsel and we have a lot of data plan and promotional bundling that we're doing with them which not only is, sort of, keeping the rates at a place that's respectable in the marketplace given the overall economy there and what the market will bear, but also is giving us exposure possibly from a marketing standpoint and promotional standpoint to particular audience segments that we may not otherwise be able to get. So -- and in terms of overall churn are you going to take that one Christine? \nLowell Singer: Yes. Christine will. \nChristine McCarthy: Yes. So in general, we are very pleased with what we've seen so far on the level of churn. And as our product offering matures and we put more content into the service and our subscriber base becomes more tenured, we expect to see our churn rates continue to decline. So in regard to the specific churn related to the anniversary of the Verizon launch promotion from last November 2020, we're really happy with the conversion numbers that we have seen there going from the promotion to become paid subscribers. We also have that price increase that consumers know about and they're expecting. But we're very comfortable with the price-value relationship that we're offering. So we think that the $1 increase will be well-received. And we believe that our current and future pricing offers attractive value to consumers. So we feel really good about where we are but we always want to improve. \nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Okay, Alexia. Thank you. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. \nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Thanks. Maybe first on the parks, I mean, given the cost reductions and the efficiencies, can we expect longer-term margins in that segment to be higher once we get back to full capacity? And then maybe a quick one on the CapEx guidance. It looks like I think you guys revised guidance for CapEx. It was I think about $0.5 billion higher on a year-over-year basis. Can you just run through the items that keep it flat on a year-over-year basis? Thanks.\nLowell Singer: Okay. John, sure. Thanks for those questions. Bob do you want to talk a little bit about parks? And then Christine you can talk a little bit about CapEx.\nBob Chapek: I would characterize this last year as being not only a year of challenge, but also a year of learning in terms of what we can do, in terms of sustained margin growth in our parks. I say that because there's nothing like a pandemic to challenge the status quo and make you be fairly introspective about a lot of things that you've maybe taken as fairly dogmatic. I think you've all seen several new announcements about things that we've done recently that may have been heresy prior to the pandemic like recasting of our annual pass program at Disneyland and reconsidering the overwhelming demand we have relative to supply. Everything we do the first lens we look at is to exceed guest expectations. And it's very tough when your park has more demand than supply, we have to put limits on it. Well as you know, we have a wide variety of margins depending on the nature of the guest and how they visit and when they visit. So with a lens towards maximizing the guest experience, we are now able to essentially reset many pieces of our business both on the cost and revenue side of the business in order to say, if we had a blank piece of paper how would we set up our parks business and be a little bit more aggressive than we typically might be able to be without the impetus of unfortunately a year-long closure. So we've had a lot of time to think particularly, at Disneyland about what could be and I think you're about to see some of those strategies be born. \nChristine McCarthy: Okay. And before I talk about CapEx, I just want to say from my perspective the Parks management team has done an outstanding job addressing cost structure. Of course, variable costs will come back in as we ramp-up operations, but they've really looked at the way they're doing business and it's really been quite impressive. So I just want to add that to what Bob has already said. As it relates to CapEx, last earnings call we had said that we expected CapEx to be up from last year. I think the number was $550 million. But now we're expecting it to be relatively flat. We have here is a couple of dynamics. We'll have increased spending at DMED and corporate, but we're going to have reduced spending at Parks. Some of the DMED spending is going to be on things like technology, in infrastructure investments related to the launch of Star and DPEP at our Parks business. Obviously, the reason that the CapEx is slowing is because some of the parks are closed and we've chosen to slow spending there.\nJohn Hodulik: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nLowell Singer: John, thanks for the question. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities. \nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. Given the viewership of Super Bowl, this year on CBS was down and it's fairly low for the last 10 years and streaming was up a lot. Can you talk about how you think about that in light of ESPN+? Like how does that factor into your conversations with the NFL? And then maybe kind of related, but how much of a factor is sports betting in these conversations? And in general how will you leverage both ESPN and ABC to capitalize on the growing legalization and adoption of sports betting. And then just back to Parks for one second, can you talk about how attendance relates to capacity? I mean you only add capacity a few days a year. So is there any way you can frame that relationship. If you allow 35% capacity is that I don't know 70% of attendance?\nLowell Singer: Okay. So Jessica I'm going to let Bob take the sports question and maybe Christine will start with the Parks question. But Bob I'll turn it over to you.\nBob Chapek: Okay. So I'll take the sports. ESPN is always a consideration whenever we look at rights going forward. In terms of the Super Bowl being down and as we're going into rights conversations with them that's obviously, something we're considering but more important than any one Super Bowl we're looking at the long-term trends of sports viewership, the MVPD universe and our own prospects of potentially a more true ESPN DTC service. So there's a lot of moving parts and a lot of elements in that mix but it's all taking into account the trends that we're seeing in the marketplace. What I will say is that we've had a long relationship with the NFL and if we have a deal, if there is a deal that will be accretive to shareholder value, we will certainly entertain that and look at that. But our first filter will be whether it makes sense for our shareholder standpoint going forward. In terms of sports betting. As you probably know we already have some programming on ESPN around the subject of sports betting. It particularly is attractive to the younger, very passionate sports audience that we find. So it's an important piece of what we're doing. We've got relationships with DraftKings and Caesars. We've got sports links with -- sports betting links with both of those, not branded Disney or ESPN obviously. But branded through their own offerings. We've got a studio in Las Vegas with Caesars that we're working on. And we've also got a variety of different things that we're entertaining for the future. So sports betting we do realize the value in that. We've obviously got some bumpers in terms of our own brand and what we think our own elasticity is in terms of us participating in such endeavors. But we're highly interested in taking the relationships that we have with both parties and taking them to the next level if that makes sense.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. Jessica. I'll address your question about capacity at the parks. You're absolutely right, there are days. Especially holiday periods where we have to shut our parks for additional entries. Those tend to be days that the park fills up quickly and we just can't accommodate more people. But that being said. We are currently operating at 35% of that full capacity. And the teams in the park, especially at Walt Disney World have really figured out a way to be as efficient as possible in operating the park that allows us to get up to that 35% and still maintain all of the protocols for social distancing for COVID. The -- I think you'll remember, when we started opening, we started at a level less than 35% but it was the -- as Bob has already mentioned, industrial engineering that we utilize and just moving people around. The other thing I'd say is, when you think about the parks, it's a combination of attendance and per caps when you're looking at revenue. As we've -- as I said in my comments and I think Bob's alluded to it on the Q&A that we've had really nice growth in per caps. It was double digits not only on a linked-quarter basis from fourth quarter to first quarter, but also double digits year-over-year. So when you think about per caps and the yield management we want to have people have a great time when they're in our parks. And when they have a good time, they tend to spend more money. So this is something that we're refining as we go along.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Great. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Jessica thanks for the question. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. Good afternoon. So back to streaming, I think at your first Disney+ Analyst Day you indicated that you'd be launched to the full world by about the end of this fiscal year or calendar year. I think it was fiscal year. So I'm just curious, if the timing for rest of world launches for Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar is on track to be completed over the next few quarters? And I'm also interested, if you have any comments on engagement for Disney+. And I'm thinking, just how customers that have been on the service a little bit longer do they still use the service as much as when they first joined? How was Mandalorian and WandaVision in terms of being watched in as many homes as you hoped? And I guess, a third piece of that would be any comments on cadence around the content slate going forward? I know, at the Analyst Day, you talked about getting to 100 shows a year, should we think about content continuing to ramp aggressively in the coming months or coming quarters? How should we think about that? Thank you.\nLowell Singer: So, Bob why don't you take these -- the streaming rollout question? And then Christine maybe you could take the engagement question and Bob will go back to you on cadence of content cycle.\nBob Chapek: Okay. Yes, we are still on schedule, where we will get to the great majority of our rollout markets by the end of the year. It's all green lights in terms of our launch not only in terms of preparation of the service itself and being able to handle it from a delivery standpoint, but also from a content curation standpoint both creation and acquisition again on the local content when we need that. As you know, we've got quite a slew of new content coming and great library of content, which really rounds out our offering and we'll add to that our local offerings in order to make it a fully robust offering for each particular market given the idiosyncrasies of what each market requires. So, it's all as planned.\nChristine McCarthy: So Doug on engagement, as we said at the Investor Day, with Disney+ originals along with the theatrical releases and the library titles, we'll be adding something new to the service every week. And in general, I would say, we are very pleased with the engagement overall, especially when we put something like WandaVision on the service. So once again, these -- any time we put a new piece of content on the engagement for people, who know what the schedule of releases is it's quite encouraging. So we believe we're going to reach that cadence of getting content on the service every week within the next few years. We've also set that target for 100-plus new titles per year. And that's across Disney Animation, Disney Live Action, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, Nat Geo. And of course, we'll continue to add more to our library as we go through time as well.\nDoug Mitchelson: Great. Thank you very much.\nLowell Singer: Okay. Thanks, Christine. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi.\nJason Bazinet: Thanks. I just have a question on parks. Since the vaccine came out last year, the buy side has this soft expectation that anyone that saw a revenue downturn because of COVID will get back to 2019 revenues by 2022, once we have herd immunity and the vaccines distributed. And every once in a while, I read some article that suggests that social distancing will still have to be in place even when herd immunity is around and people will still have to wear masks. So, do you guys have any counsel or insight in terms of how you're thinking about sort of how the parks will operate by the time we get to 2022? And any reason, not to believe that we won't sort of get back to 2019 revenues assuming that the economy is fine and all that? \nLowell Singer: Thanks Jason. I'm going to turn that over to Bob. \nBob Chapek: Yes. I won't specifically comment on whether we anticipate getting to 2019 revenues by 2022, but I will tell you what our expectations are in terms of the state of the world by then. We have no doubt that when we reopen up in parks that were closed or increase the capacity that we'll have some level of social distancing and mask wearing for the remainder of this year. That's our expectation. But I believe that Dr. Fauci said earlier today that, he hopes that there's vaccines for everyone who wants them by April this year. If that happens that is a game changer. And that could accelerate our expectations and give people the confidence that they need to come back to the parks. Will there be some overlap until we know that we've hit herd immunity? Sure there will. But do we also believe that we'll be in the same state of 6-foot social distancing and mask wearing in '22? Absolutely not. \nJason Bazinet: Thank you.\nBob Chapek: Hey thanks Jason. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. \nBrett Feldman: Thanks for taking the question. So if I go back to the December Analyst Day, you had outlined an expectation that Disney+ would see peak operating losses in this fiscal year and achieve profitability by fiscal year '24. When we look at the DTC P&L in the quarter you just reported in your outlook, it seems like you're trending much better than that for this fiscal year. So I'm curious do we need to revisit any of this guidance either because of accounting changes related to the resegmentation or maybe just underlying operating trends that are perhaps better than you had expected? Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Brett thank you for the question. I'm going to turn that one over to Christine. \nChristine McCarthy: Okay. Thanks Brett. You're absolutely right. Peak losses we expect in this fiscal year. We said at our Investor Day which wasn't too long ago that we expected to reach profitability in fiscal 2024. We're not going to change that at this point although we are very pleased with the results that we just announced. But we are also -- given the value of growing our sub base, we are continuing to invest in high-quality content. We believe that content is the single biggest driver to not only acquiring subs, but retaining them. We're also going to have some other cost drivers that we just have to factor into our timing for profitability and that includes marketing, technology, customer service and just other expenses of running a new business. So we're sticking to that 2024 -- fiscal 2024 profitability. But once again we're very pleased with where we are today.\nBrett Feldman: If you wouldn't mind if I guess ask a quick follow-up question. You've gotten the question about whether you see any churn risk around the rate adjustments that are going to be coming this year. Are you expecting maybe to spend a bit more around engagement or awareness or marketing or anything just to make sure that as you transition out of the launch phase and promotional period phases and into your first ever rate adjustment that your customer base feels connected with you and that you don't experience that speed bump? \nChristine McCarthy: We believe that keeping subscribers informed about what's on the service is extremely important. So the awareness that we'll create through targeted marketing and marketing of the brand will basically mitigate what we believe is a very reasonable price increase given the amount of content and the value to subscribers. \nRob Chapek: Yes Christine if I can just jump in here as well. We believe that we've got a great price-value relationship. I mean think about it from a Star Wars franchise, we moved from Mando 2 to Boba Fett later on this year to Mandalorian 3. And on a Marvel standpoint we go from WandaVision to Falcon and the Winter Soldier and to Loki. So I think the best insulation we've got is to keep the price-value relationship very high and there's no better way to do it than powerhouse franchises cranking out regular new releases on a monthly basis. Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Operator we have time for one more question. \nOperator: This question comes from the line of Michael Morris with Guggenheim.\nMichael Morris: Thank you, guys. Good afternoon. A couple of questions on streaming. First, I want to ask you about Hulu, the SVOD service on Hulu. Hoping you can maybe share a little bit about the dynamic that's going on there, what the mix of sort of ad-supported versus ad-free subscriber base looks like. And there are a number of these now free ad-supported streaming services that have been growing and being more aggressively populated. I'm curious, how you see that competitive dynamic playing out? And I want to ask one question about sports. Bob, you mentioned the MegaCast approach to a couple of your big events. And I'm curious, as you look at your ability to provide that, what's the economic benefit to you? Do you -- is this primarily about putting it in front of more people, and therefore being able to monetize better? Or, is there an element of your ability to deliver a MegaCast, when you were negotiating for content rights, sports rights, with the leagues or teams, the owners there that you have a somewhat stronger negotiating position relative to your peers? Thank you.\nLowell Singer: Okay Mike. It's good to hear from you. I'm going to let, Christine take the Hulu SVOD question. And then, I'll ask Bob to address the MegaCast question.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, Mike. So on Hulu SVOD, when you look at the relative mix of ad-supported versus ad-free more of the subscribers are in the ad-free -- ad-supported. And that is where we have seen the really nice growth of our addressable advertising. So, that -- we're very comfortable and we actually -- we like the mix that we have, but it is more ad-supported, so we enjoy that relative increase of advertising. But it's pretty much been the track record that Hulu has of having that relationship of ad-supported versus ad-free has been relatively consistent, over their 10-year tenure.\nBob Chapek: Yes. And on a multicast question, I think it's both, both elements. So I think there's a consumer benefit to the fact that nobody else, could do what ESPN does in terms of the multicast. And I think we've proven that in several different ways, over the last few months with big football events being broadcast. But I think there's also an element that, that then, is obvious not only to us and obvious to our consumers, but obvious to our prospective partners, as we go into negotiations of new deals. I think there's probably a, mentality that well the more times we divide this up, the better off we're going to be, from the prospective rights owners. And I think what we're doing is throwing a wrench into that thinking. And suggesting that, maybe by taking a consumer-first approach and saying, boy, consumer choice is really a good thing for everybody, let's go ahead and maximize the number of touch points we have, not only do we get a benefit from our subscriber base for those folks that have ESPN, but I think it's also very apparent to the leagues who hold the rights.\nMichael Morris: Great. Thank you, Bob.\nLowell Singer: Mike, thank you. And thanks again everyone for joining us today.

At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the floor over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Walt Disney Company, Alexia Quadrani. Ma\u2019am, please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani: Good afternoon. It\u2019s my pleasure to welcome everybody to the Walt Disney Company\u2019s fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today\u2019s call is being webcast and a replay and transcript will also be available on our website. Joining me for today\u2019s call are Bob Chapek, Disney\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we will be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nBob Chapek: Thank you, Alexia and good afternoon everyone. Fiscal 2022 was a strong year for our company as we continued our journey of telling the incredible Disney stories, utilizing ground-breaking technology in order to further develop our brands and franchises while customizing and personalizing experiences to make magical memories that last a lifetime. Those efforts resulted in truly phenomenal storytelling, record annual results at our Parks, Experiences and Products segment, and outstanding growth at our direct-to-consumer services, which added nearly 57 million subscriptions this year to reach a total of more than 235 million. We are particularly pleased with growth in the fourth quarter, which saw the addition of 14.6 million subscriptions across our suite of services including 12 million Disney+ subscriptions, over 9 million of which were core Disney+. It has taken just 3 short years for Disney+ to transform from a nascent business to an industry leader. That transformation is the direct result of the strategic decision we made at launch to heavily invest in our Direct-to-Consumer offering, a decision made knowing that achieving rapid growth would result in short-term losses. Building a streaming powerhouse has required significant investment. And now with its scale, incredible content pipeline and global reach, Disney+ is well situated to leverage our position for long-term profitability and success. Our financial results this quarter represent a turning point as we reached peak DTC operating losses, which we expect to decline going forward. That expectation is based on three factors: first, the benefit of both price increases and the launch of the Disney+ ad tier next month; second, a realignment of our cost, including meaningful rationalization of our marketing spend; and third, leveraging our learnings and experience in direct-to-consumer to optimize our content slate and distribution approach to deliver a steady state of high-impact releases that efficiently drive engagement and subscriber acquisition. With these factors, we believe we are on a path to profitable streaming business that generates shareholder value long into the future. And assuming we do not see a meaningful shift in the economic climate, we still expect Disney+ to achieve profitability in fiscal 2024 as losses begin to shrink in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Christine will go into more detail on the drivers of our direct-to-consumer operating performance and provide more insight into our expectations going forward and some of our key assumptions. But first, I\u2019d like to share a few highlights from the quarter. Q4 was another strong period for Parks, Experiences and Products, which continue to deliver phenomenal results despite the impact of Hurricane Ian. I want to thank the amazing cast members in Orlando who went above and beyond to help keep our guests safe and entertained during the storm. From protecting the many animals at Disney Animal Kingdom to packing thousands of meal kits to donating and delivering emergency supplies to the community, I am so proud of how our team came together to support our guests, our neighbors and each other. Our Parks team is laser focused on enhancing the guest experience in creating those magical memories I mentioned at the outset. This focus, along with the investments we made to bringing new attractions and experiences to our domestic parks, is generating consistently strong demand, which, on many days, exceeds our current capacity. And we continue to manage attendance levels with a focus on providing guests with the highest quality experience and enhancing our Parks\u2019 overall financial performance. One of the things our guests love most is the opportunity to celebrate at our parks as evidenced by the post-pandemic return and sell-out of special ticketed events like Boogie Boogie Bash and Mickey\u2019s Not So Scary Halloween Party. I visited Disneyland with my family just before Halloween and the celebration was phenomenal. Tickets for Mickey\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Party at Walt Disney World has now officially gone on sale and over half of all dates have already sold out. As you know, we are about to embark on the company\u2019s 100th anniversary celebration. The fun kicks off at our parks on January 27 at Disneyland, where we will unveil new platinum infused decor, Premier 2, all new night-time spectaculars and opened a highly anticipated Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway attraction. This is only one part of what will be the largest cross-company celebration in Disney\u2019s history with activations around the world and we are so excited for fans and families to join us. At our international parks, Disneyland Paris is enjoying a great resurgence. Our fantastic new Marvel Avengers Campus opened on July 20 and guests love the highly immersive and dynamic environment of the first-ever Marvel-themed land in Europe. Prior to the recent closure of Shanghai Disney Resort, we are seeing positive momentum there and at Hong Kong Disneyland. We are hopeful that the situation will improve and are thinking of all of our employees there as we manage through the challenging COVID environment. Our Disney Cruise Line is showing strong signs of recovery. The new Disney Wish is in high demand, and we have seen a ramp-up in bookings for our base fleet. This quarter was also exceptionally strong in terms of creative excellence across our content engines. Our teams received 57 Emmy Awards spread across a remarkable 37 different titles emanating from a wide range of brands, franchises and distribution channels. ABC ended the season as number one in entertainment programming for the third consecutive year and ABC News continues to be the most trusted source in news with number one positions across all day parts. Theatrically, Thor: Love and Thunder, the character\u2019s fourth standalone film, earned over $760 million worldwide. This is our first time we released a fourth film based on a single Marvel character and Thor\u2019s longevity is a great sign for Marvel and our ability to tell stories based on its characters long into the future. The fourth quarter was also the first time in Disney history that we released tentpole original content from Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar and National Geographic, an indication that we are now at full cadence of new releases as we hit our steady state. As evidenced, Hocus Focus 2 was a smash hit, becoming not only the most watched premier on Disney+, but also a Nielsen record-setting streaming movie with 2.7 billion minutes viewed in its first weekend. And Marvel Studios, Ms. Marvel completed its run in July and She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, debuted in August, contributing to subscriber growth and driving substantial engagement. Lucasfilm\u2019s Andor, a spy thriller that explores the back story of Cassian Andor, a popular character from Rogue One, earned great reviews and showcases our ability to extend stories from the big screen to our streaming services. Turning to general entertainment, the critically acclaimed Prey from 20th Century Studios was Hulu\u2019s biggest premier ever across all films and series and was the most watched film premier on Star+ in Latin America and Disney+ under the Star banner in all other territories. Looking ahead, we are thrilled that audiences are returning to the box office for blockbuster films and we have big plans for the big screen in the fiscal year 2023. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever opens this Friday and Ryan Coogler has delivered yet another culture-defining powerful film. The reaction to this film\u2019s premier a few weeks ago was incredible and fan anticipation is very high, as indicated by the strength of advanced ticket sales. Up next is Strange World from Walt Disney Animation Studios, which opens in theaters this Thanksgiving. The highly anticipated Avatar: The Way of Water opens on December 16 and is the sequel to the highest grossing film of all time. James Cameron and his team have once again created something truly magical using ground-breaking technology. Audiences are as excited as we are to return to Pandora. And given the strong performance of September\u2019s re-release of the original Avatar, we can\u2019t wait for the film to hit screens. Our Searchlight Studio continues to deliver critically acclaimed films and three fantastic titles will be in theaters this quarter: The Banshees of Inisherin, which has earned critical acclaim since its Venice premier; The Menu starting Ralph Fiennes and Anya Taylor-Joy; and the Empire of Light from Academy Award winner, Sam Mendes. Looking even further to 2023, we will see theatrical releases of three highly anticipated Marvel films: Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3, and The Marvels. And we could not be more excited about Disney live actions, the Little Mermaid, a re-imagining of one of the most popular animated films of all time, starring Halle Bailey, whose rendition A Part of Your World has already lit up the Internet. We are also bringing 999 Happy Haunts to Life with the hilarious new live action Haunted Mansion featuring an all-star cast. Pixar will debut an all new original feature, Elemental and Harrison Ford is back in the eagerly awaited fifth Indiana Jones film, which is going to be spectacular. Of course, all of our theatrical titles will eventually make their way on to our streaming platforms, complementing a robust slate of original content. Utopia+, a new series from Disney Animation debuts tomorrow, along with Save Our Squad, an original series from the UK that sees soccer superstar David Beckham return home to mentor a grassroots team of young boys struggling to survive in their league. On November 18, Disney+ will release Disenchanted, based on the successful Enchanted that came out 15 years ago. Marvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special will follow right after and Willow, another long-awaited sequel from Lucasfilm, will premiere the following week. We are so fortunate to have an abundance of content from all of our creative engines paired with the wealth of knowledge and insight into what resonates with our fans. As we move forward, we will increasingly leverage that knowledge to refine our distribution decisions in order to best serve our audience and maximize the return on our content investments. Turning to sports, ESPN was the number one cable network in total day and prime viewing amongst audiences aged 18 to 49 in Q4 and The Walt Disney Company was responsible for 40% of sports hours watched amongst that age bracket, the biggest share of any family of networks. ESPN continues to lead with its multi-platform sports ecosystem with reach across linear streaming, digital and social media serving fans at massive scale. With the power and support of The Walt Disney Company behind it, ESPN is an unequaled reach machine. And the business is well positioned through our strategic portfolio of long-term rights agreements with an eye to remaining disciplined in our approach. We recently announced an extension with Formula 1 through 2025, which is one of the fastest growing sports properties and is on pace to surpass last year\u2019s record audience on ESPN. The 2022 College Football season is off to its best 9-week start in 5 years across our networks. And thanks to our incoming SEC agreement in 2024, we will remain the leading college football platform with over 60% of the college football market. And our new long-term NFL agreement includes Super Bowls and annual ESPN+ exclusive match-up and more regular season and playoff games and better scheduling. On October 30, we marked another milestone moment in our DTC streaming services and the growth of ESPN+ when the Broncos versus Jaguars NFL game from London became our most viewed ESPN+ event ever. Finally, we are exactly 1 month from the U.S. launch of Disney+\u2019s ad-supported subscription offering, which is a win for audiences, advertisers and shareholders. The launch will bring fans a new slate of subscription plans across Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ and the Disney bundle giving viewers flexibility in choosing an option that suits their needs. The offering also adds a key component to our total company advertising portfolio and advertiser interest has been strong. We have been a leader in streaming advertising for some time and are bringing our years of experience, leading ad tech and relationships to this important opportunity. Disney+ has secured more than 100 advertisers for our domestic launch window, spanning a wide range of categories and our company has over 8,000 existing relationships with advertisers who will have the opportunity to advertise on Disney+. Strong base pricing reflects the value advertisers put on our audience, our brand safe environment for their messages, and our sales experience. We also have proven technology to deliver a great advertising experience on day 1. And importantly, we have the ability to scale and innovate for audiences and advertisers alike. We are incredibly excited about the launch of our new ad-supported subscription offering for Disney+, which rolls out on December 8. 2022 was an important year of recovery coming out of the pandemic as we made foundational investments in our long-term success. As we celebrate the 3-year anniversary of Disney+ this week, I can\u2019t help but reflect upon how our commitment to and substantial investment in our DTC business has helped create the world\u2019s most powerful suite of streaming services with the ability to reach hundreds of millions of viewers around the world with must-see content. Services, which aren\u2019t just content delivery systems, but platforms that bring us closer to audiences than ever before and enable consumers to access more of The Walt Disney Company\u2019s total offering. With our unmatched brands and franchises, robust pipeline of content capable of filling all of our distribution channels, unique experiences and strong connections to audiences around the world, I believe we are well positioned for future long-term growth and I am confident in the path forward. With that, I will turn it over to Christine to talk in greater detail about our quarter and the year ahead.\nChristine McCarthy: Good afternoon, everyone. We have wrapped up another dynamic fiscal year. And as we enter into fiscal 2023, I will be diving a bit deeper than usual today into the results of our businesses and we will give some additional color on where we expect to go from here, especially given the inflection point that we believe we have now reached in our direct-to-consumer business. Excluding certain items, our company\u2019s diluted earnings per share for the fourth fiscal quarter was $0.30 and for the full fiscal 2022 year, diluted EPS, excluding certain items, was $3.53. Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment had another stellar quarter with DPEP operating income in the fourth quarter, more than doubling versus the prior year to $1.5 billion. Our domestic parks delivered significant year-over-year revenue and operating income growth despite an adverse impact of approximately $65 million to segment operating income from Hurricane Ian. And per capita spending remained strong, increasing 6% versus Q4 of fiscal 2021 and nearly 40% versus fiscal 2019, reflecting the continued popularity of premium offerings, including Genie+ and Lightning Lane. We are also making meaningful progress on the return of international visitors to our domestic parks, particularly at Walt Disney World, where the mix of international attendance in the fourth quarter was roughly in line with pre-pandemic levels. Looking towards fiscal 2023, while we continue to monitor our booking trends for any macroeconomic impacts, we are still seeing robust demand at our domestic parks and are anticipating a strong holiday season in Q1. Disney Cruise Line was also a meaningful contributor to the year-over-year increase in domestic parks and experiences\u2019 operating income in Q4, reflecting the successful launch of the Disney Wish in July and continued recovery of the existing fleet coming out of the pandemic. Quarter-to-date, occupancy for the Wish continues to exceed 90%, while we have also seen a meaningful pickup in the rest of our fleet with booked revenue up versus pre-pandemic levels. At International Parks, fourth quarter results also improved significantly year-over-year, driven by continued strength at Disneyland Paris, partially offset by a decrease at Shanghai Disney Resort. As Bob mentioned, the situation in Shanghai has recently been challenging. The park is currently closed, and we do not yet have visibility to a reopening date. Q4 results at Consumer Products also increased versus the prior year, driven by higher merchandise licensing results across several of our key franchises, including Mickey and Friends, Encanto and Toy Story. Moving on to Media and Entertainment Distribution. Operating income in the fourth quarter decreased by $864 million versus the prior year as a modest increase at linear networks was more than offset by wider losses at direct-to-consumer and to a lesser extent, at content, sales, licensing and other. At Linear Networks, operating income in the fourth quarter increased 6% to $1.7 billion, driven primarily by growth at domestic channels. The increase at domestic channels primarily reflects higher results at cable driven by lower programming and production costs, partially offset by a decrease in advertising revenue. Compared to the prior year fourth quarter, cable programming and production costs benefited from the timing of the NBA finals which were in Q4 of fiscal 2021 versus Q3 of fiscal 2022 as well as from lower costs for Major League Baseball programming due to fewer games under our new contract. These impacts were partially offset by higher NFL programming costs as a result of one additional game aired versus the prior year quarter. The decrease in cable advertising revenue versus the prior year fourth quarter also reflects the timing impact of the NBA Finals. ESPN advertising revenue in Q4 was down 23% year-over-year. However, adjusting for the timing impact of the NBA Finals, it was down roughly 2%. Note that in Q1 of fiscal 2023, we also expect to see a timing impact versus the prior year from two college football playoff games that are shifting into the second fiscal quarter this year versus the first quarter last year. Quarter-to-date, ESPN domestic cash advertising sales are pacing down, reflecting in part the absence of these two CFP games. The advertising landscape remains fluid. The sports marketplace, in particular, is delivering strong audiences across our platforms with marketers looking to take advantage of live events and several categories, including political, pharma, insurance and restaurants, have continued to show relatively stable demand while others remain cautious in anticipation of potential economic softness. Total domestic affiliate revenue in the fourth quarter increased by 2% from the prior year, driven by 5 points of growth from contractual rate increases, partially offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Looking ahead, we expect to see linear subscriber declines accelerate more in line with industry trends. International channels operating income decreased by $25 million in the fourth quarter versus the prior year, reflecting lower results from our ongoing channels and operation partially offset by a benefit from channel closures. At content sales, licensing and other, results decreased versus the prior year by a little over $100 million, in line with guidance due to lower TV/SVOD and home entertainment results, partially offset by higher theatrical results and an increase at our stage play business. While difficult comparisons may persist in the intermediate term at our TV/SVOD and home entertainment businesses, results will vary quarter-to-quarter. And we currently expect content sales, licensing and other operating results to improve slightly in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 on both the sequential and year-over-year basis. Finally, I\u2019d like to spend some time talking about our fourth quarter results at Direct-to-Consumer, where our losses peaked in the fourth quarter at approximately $1.5 billion. Hulu and ESPN+ added approximately 1 million and 1.5 million subscribers, respectively, during the quarter, while Disney+ added over 12 million global subscribers, of which a little less than 3 million were at Disney+ Hotstar. Core Disney+ added over 9 million subs in Q4, accelerating as expected versus the $6 million net adds we saw in the third quarter, reflecting the success of Disney+ Day and our Tempo content releases in addition to continued growth from third quarter market launches. Nearly $2 million of this net adds were from the U.S. and Canada and a little over 7 million were international core additions. At the same time, core Disney+ ARPU decreased by 5% between Q3 and Q4, reflecting an adverse foreign exchange impact and to a lesser extent, a slightly higher mix of subscribers from lower-priced international markets. ARPU at each streaming service is also impacted by the mix of subscribers to the bundle. Our bundled and multiproduct offerings now account for over 40% of our fiscal year-end domestic Disney+ subscriber count. This shift has been purposeful as the bundle drives higher total company subscription revenue and higher long-term subscriber value due to notably lower churn. Lower pay-per-view revenue at ESPN+ and slightly lower advertising revenue at Hulu and Disney+ Hotstar also impacted Direct-to-Consumer revenue in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. With our expectation that peak losses are now behind us, DTC operating results should improve going forward as we lay the foundation for a sustainably profitable business model. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect direct-to-consumer operating results to improve by at least $200 million versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, with larger improvement expected in Q2, reflecting a couple of key factors. First, our recently announced price increases across our Direct-to-Consumer offerings in the U.S. should begin to modestly benefit ARPU and subscription revenue in the first quarter. However, given that the Disney+ price increase will not go into effect until towards the end of Q1, this benefit will be realized more fully in the second quarter. Similarly, we do not expect the launch of the advertising-supported tier of Disney+ in December to provide a more meaningful financial impact until later this fiscal year. Additionally, our commitment to cost rationalization will allow us to scale effectively against our investments. In particular, while DTC programming and production costs will increase from Q4 to Q1 over the course of the year, content expense and OpEx growth should slow as we approach steady state and marketing costs should decline as we continue to focus on aligning our costs with our dynamic business models. As it relates to subscribers, we expect ESPN+ and Hulu will continue to add new subscribers in Q1, and we expect core Disney+ subscribers to increase only slightly in the quarter, reflecting tougher comparisons against Disney+ Day performance. As we\u2019ve mentioned before, subscriber growth will not be linear each and every quarter, and the trend is driven by several factors, including content releases and promotions. We expect Disney+ core subscriber growth to then accelerate in the fiscal second quarter, largely driven by international markets. And at Disney+ Hotstar, we are currently expecting that subscribers will decline in Q1 due to the absence of the IPL, but we do expect to see some stabilization in Q2. I\u2019ll note that our Direct-to-Consumer expectations are built on certain assumptions around subscriber additions based on the attractiveness of our future content, churn expectations for our upcoming price increases, the financial impact of the Disney+ ad tier and price increases and our ability to quickly execute on cost rationalization while preserving revenue, all of which, while based on extensive internal analysis as well as recent experience provides a layer of uncertainty in our outlook. Before we conclude, there are a couple of other items I would like to mention around our fiscal 2023 expectations. Cash content spend totaled $30 billion in fiscal 2022, and we continue to expect it to be in the low $30 billion range for fiscal 2023. Capital expenditures totaled nearly $5 billion in fiscal 2022, in line with our expectations, and we currently expect that CapEx will increase in fiscal 2023 to a total of $6.7 billion, driven by higher spend across the enterprise. Putting this all together, assuming we do not see a meaningful shift in the macroeconomic climate, we currently expect total company\u2019s fiscal 2023 revenue and segment operating income to both grow at a high single-digit percentage rate versus fiscal 2022. We are confident about the opportunities we see to continue to transform our business for the next 100 years and look forward to sharing our progress with you all throughout 2023. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Alexia, and we would be happy to take your questions.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thanks, Christine. [Operator Instructions] And with that, operator, we\u2019re ready for your first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Good morning. It\u2019s good afternoon, sorry. Two questions, Bob. Can you talk a little bit about how \u2013 what\u2019s the consumer experience going to be like as you roll out this price increase here in a month? You\u2019ve got customers on lots of different plans, different distributors. Can you talk a little bit about your confidence that it\u2019s going to be seamless and that consumers will have the ability to choose the plan that works best for them? And then, Christine, on the Parks margins, U.S. margins this quarter. I think through the first three quarters of fiscal \u201822, margins were up pretty nicely versus \u201819, and they were actually down, I think, this quarter. It didn\u2019t sound like there was anything in your prepared remarks that sort of commented on that. There was a mention of cost inflation in the release. But just wondering if you could spend a little bit of time talking about some of the cost drivers in the U.S. Parks business in the quarter, anything unusual that you would want to call out and how we might want to think about that heading into \u201823? Thank you.\nBob Chapek: Alright. Thank you, Ben. In terms of trying to communicate to consumers the multitude of options we\u2019re getting them, we believe that more choice is actually good. And you\u2019re right, it\u2019s predicated upon our ability to communicate the options to the consumer but we\u2019ve got so many years of history with Hulu, where we\u2019ve given them options between advertising and non-advertising Hulu+ Live TV, without Hulu+ Live TV that we believe that we\u2019ve got a pretty good formula for how we could communicate and that formulas* work very well domestically. And so we believe it will work as well internationally as well as across both Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. I think it\u2019s important to keep in mind that we\u2019ve got unmatched brands. And as we continue to go ahead and extend our reach and there are different business models, different pricing models to consumers that, that choice itself will really enable us to have maximum penetration regardless of the brand under which the option is given to consumers, but also at the same time, as our platforms become just that, more and more platforms and less and less just distribution options we\u2019ve got a pretty good formula, I think, for making that simple for the consumer, but also enabling for the consumer to go ahead and subscribe in the way that suits them best.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. Ben, on your question about the Parks margins. So DPEP\u2019s segment margin came in around 20.4% for this quarter, and that is lower than previous quarters this year. Let\u2019s remember that Q4 is historically the lowest quarter of the year for margins. And there is two things going on here, both is on the revenue and the expense side. On the revenue side, it is primarily driven by traditional seasonality, back-to-school time and to a lesser extent, as I called out in my comments, the impact of Hurricane Ian, that was a $65 million drag on the quarter. We have been using 2019 as our base for comparison, pre-pandemic. So when you compare it to fiscal \u201819 Q4 the lower margin is driven by international park performance. And then if you flip to the expense side, the increase in quarter-over-quarter expenses is the continued effect of bringing on some more guest offerings. Those are things like night-time spectaculars. We also have hard ticket events, and they have a lot of cost just in terms of setup and breakdown. We also remember, have a new ship, the Wish that just started operations, and there are some other smaller one-time items, but those are the real drivers of that lower margin this quarter.\nAlexia Quadrani: Alright. Thank you. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Philip Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nPhilip Cusick: Hi. Thank you. Turning to the DTC, I guess let\u2019s focus on the profit in \u201824 guidance. We have talked in the past that this means for probably a quarter or two in \u201824, not for the full year. Is that still the way to think about it? And I did notice the comment about assuming the economy maybe doesn\u2019t get worse or something like that. Can you just talk about what drove you to add that language?\nChristine McCarthy: Well, I will take that, Phil. So, direct-to-consumer for \u201824 profitability, you should be thinking about it as a quarter, not a year basis. And then on some of the profitability drivers that we talked about that I think answered the question about the economy. We do have things like the steady state of content on the service, that\u2019s independent of the economy. We are focusing on bundled offerings as we refine our value proposition. There is also increasing international core market penetration. Once again, that is somewhat reliant on a stable economy. And increasing ARPU through the pricing increases would also, I think be something that could be sensitive to the economic environment. We do have the Disney+ ad tier launch and ad monetization growth. And the indications that we have so far is that those are very strong. So, we really are looking at sort of the puts and takes on what\u2019s going to be economically sensitive. But we just think in abundance of caution, we really have to keep the health of the consumer in mind when we think about achieving all of our goals this upcoming year.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question.\nPhilip Cusick: Thank you. If I can follow-up\u2026\nAlexia Quadrani: Okay. Go ahead, Phil.\nPhilip Cusick: I was just going to say you called out a few \u2013 both you and Bob called out G&A and marketing savings on the call. How is Disney thinking about just cost in general? Is there a process going on today to cut costs across the board? And what might the timing of that be? Thanks again.\nChristine McCarthy: Yes. Thanks for that question and follow-up, Phil. We are actively evaluating our cost base currently, and we are looking for meaningful efficiencies. Some of those are going to provide some near-term savings and others are going to drive longer term structural benefits. I just would point to what we did in the parks during the pandemic. We did some structural changes and the parks is better off because of that. But those were structural benefits that did not flow back into their cost base. We will update you with more information as our plan evolves.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question.\nPhilip Cusick: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. I have two. One is on the parks in \u201823. I was trying to understand what levers can you pull do you think if there is a slow U.S. consumer, what can you do to kind of maintain the revenue growth or I guess the revenue that we have seen? So, in other words, what can be different this time versus previous downturns? And then Christine, I just want to* come back to that operating profit guide, which you never give. So, I appreciate the fact you did it. I am just trying to get the piece parts, right. DTC is going to get better, parks is showing the weakness. But can you hone in a bit on the outlook for the rest of DMED in \u201923? Is that what you see as kind of the slower of a lot of growth next year? Thanks.\nChristine McCarthy: Yes. So, talking about parks, Michael, what is different is compared to the last time we had a slowdown in the economy for managing our parks business, we have more commercial tools and levers available to us. One of the ones that\u2019s quite obvious is discounting. That\u2019s something that we have used in the past, and we will continue to use it because it is an effective lever for managing your yield, but we are not going to use it to the extent to which we used it during the last recession. Some of the other things that are new would be the reservation system. So, we manage attendance now. We can track it real time. On many days, we are fully booked now, but we can adjust that and be very flexible and real time on adjusting it if we so choose. The other thing is we have a tiered pricing structure that gives us a lot of flexibility. And we also have re-imagined our annual pass business model, and we could also have some more flexibility in using our annual pass program. We also have technology advancements, and this is more on the expense side. That provides us opportunities for cost flexibility. So, we have things like mobile ordering, contactless check-in, so those kinds of things give us levers on the expense side. But we do feel that we have, once again, harkening back to the opportunity we took during the pandemic. We did permanently remove a significant amount of operating expense at the parks, and that better positions us right now as we go into an uncertain economic environment.\nMichael Nathanson: Okay.\nAlexia Quadrani: Michael, do you have a second question?\nMichael Nathanson: Well, it was on the OI guide, right, which you don\u2019t usually give. Just trying and dig into the DMED outlook given what you have said about the other businesses at this point.\nChristine McCarthy: Yes. We gave the outlook that was more for the company as a whole, but we are still looking at DPEP being a strong \u2013 continuing its strong growth. DMED, we are looking at it in three components. The direct-to-consumer, we are looking at improving profitability, as we have mentioned. We believe that this quarter that we are reporting is the low point, and it will improve for here. CLS&O, that will have some challenges, as we said, so that will be variable quarter-to-quarter. And then we have to look at our linear business. And we do have sub declines that are in line with the industry, and that\u2019s one that is just an industry issue that we are all going to be managing through.\nAlexia Quadrani: Alright. Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. Maybe I guess \u2013 if you look at the streaming business as a whole, and if you step back and look at the strategy going forward, you will see a price increase next quarter. And of course, there is also the ad-supported tier that could help manage some of the churn. But as an offset, it seems like some of your marketing expense will be optimized along with some content spending. So, Bob, if you look at the guidance right now, your subscriber growth needs to accelerate going forward in order to get to the guidance, but a lot of the levers like pricing may actually force churn to be higher and marketing costs naturally trend a little bit lower. So, when we think about this, how do we reconcile the subscriber guidance with the financial model of the business? And does it make sense to maybe focus more on profitability rather than some growth from our perspective going forward?\nBob Chapek: Our approach going forward is going to be focused largely on profitability, keeping in mind though, that the revenue growth that we have is also going to be a key component towards the overall profitability. If we look at the content that\u2019s going to actually fuel our subscriber growth and our engagement, we are obviously managing that very carefully. Christine talked about some cost management initiatives. That\u2019s not only across marketing, but also on the content spending itself as well. But we have also got an opportunity, I believe to manage that profitability through that pricing power that we believe we have. We launched these services at tremendous values to the consumer. And everything that we have got shows us that we still have some opportunity for continued price value exploration on all of our services. So, we believe that \u2013 and our history shows that when we have taken price increases across our streaming businesses that we don\u2019t meaningfully increase churn or cancellations. So, we believe we have still got some headroom there. So, whether it\u2019s cost management or attention to revenue growth through sub ads through our great content additions or through ARPU, we believe that we have got a formula that gives us great confidence that we are going to achieve the guidance that we communicated.\nAlexia Quadrani: Great. Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nSteven Cahall: Thanks. So Bob, I think you called ESPN, a reach machine, and Christine talked about the cord-cutting and how that\u2019s something that everybody is going to be managing through. So, as you look to expand the reach of ESPN, I know we have had this question before, but how do you think about starting to make a lot of the marquee streaming rights \u2013 or sorry, marquee sports rights also available on the streaming services whether that\u2019s ESPN+ or others? And how do you think about monetizing in a streaming world with a lot more of those expensive rights available? And then, Christine, just on the CapEx, it\u2019s moving up $1.5 billion or so this year. I know some of that is maybe a shift of about $500 million from last year, but it\u2019s still a little more elevated than history. You said it was enterprise-wide. So, I am wondering if the increase is more capital projects on the park side or if it\u2019s other things like technology or studio expansions. Thank you\nBob Chapek: Okay. In terms of ESPN growth, I think we all have to keep in mind that, number one, ESPN is that powerhouse brand. And we certainly, over time, have been able to enjoy the benefits of that brand in a linear world. However, going forward, we have got the ability not only to continue to enjoy those benefits in the linear world, but also began to grow our opportunities in the digital realm and leverage that brand\u2019s growth into other avenues that therefore we have not been able to necessarily tap into. I think it\u2019s also important to look at ESPN in terms of an important part of the overall Disney portfolio or synergy machine. It is an integral part of the bundle itself. So, when you take the fact that it\u2019s a great brand, we have the opportunity to grow it into different avenues. And as I have said before, sort of one foot on the dock, one foot on the boat and be flexible in terms of our speed of evolution, I think it\u2019s going to be an important part of our business going forward. Live advertising continues to be a really important benefit that we sell into our advertising community. We have got multiple platforms, and I believe that it\u2019s going to be a very robust part of our company going forward, whether or not it\u2019s linear or whether it\u2019s digital or somewhere in between.\nChristine McCarthy: So, on CapEx, Steve, yes, you are right. It is up. That was in my comments. As you \u2013 for those who have followed the company for a while, we usually give you a CapEx number for the beginning of the year and by the end of the year, we haven\u2019t spent it all. So, there is some slippage that goes from 1 year into the next. And also just with supply chain and labor shortages in various parts of the world where we are having projects, that slippage is probably a little more amplified. We do have some technology spend both at the enterprise level as well as in DMED. Some of it is consumer-facing. Some of it is more internal to once again deliver longer term efficiencies. And we have DPEP projects pretty much everywhere around the globe. So, we are continuing to build out those projects either on schedule or with some slippage that is slipping into \u201823.\nSteven Cahall: Thank you.\nAlexia Quadrani: Alright. Thank you. Operator, I think we have time one more question.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Morris from Guggenheim. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Morris: Thanks for taking my question. Good afternoon guys. Two for me. One, Christine, I am hoping you can give us a little more detail on the sequential revenue decline at the DTC segment. You talked about foreign exchange. Could you quantify how much of it came from foreign exchange, because as I am looking at the ARPUs on the domestic business, domestic Disney+ in particular, they have sequentially come in as well. So, maybe how much was FX? And a little bit more detail on kind of at the core, what\u2019s driving that Disney+ ARPU compression. My second question is on sports rights. There was an article out today about Netflix potentially looking at some sports rights. Amazon seems to have had success with Thursday night football package. So, Bob, I am curious how you see the landscape changing as these new entrants come in, if you see it changing at all and how it impacts the environment? Thank you.\nChristine McCarthy: Yes. I will take the first one, Mike, on the revenue decline. So, there are a couple of things. One is that on the ARPU, the impact of foreign exchange on ARPU was about half of the decline. And we do hedge and we have very successfully managed through this year\u2019s strong dollar for the most part. However, as you know, we are in markets all over the globe and some of the markets in which we have launched their currency, we do not hedge for either extraordinarily high costs or illiquidity. So, that foreign exchange impact was about half of the impact. And the other one is lower pay-per-view and this was at ESPN+. We have UFC, but we had a different game sched \u2013 different match schedules. You can tell I am not a UFC fan when I call them games, but a different match schedule and the omission of a key personality in MacGregor. So, that actually were the two primary factors lowering that year-over-year revenue.\nAlexia Quadrani: Bob, do you want to take the second?\nBob Chapek: Okay. Yes, in terms of the sort of the landscape changing with new entrants, we really like our strong position that we have got going forward, not only in terms of the breadth of the sports that we are engaged in, but also the terms of the deals that we have. So, we have exercised with discipline. I think the college conferences in terms of our negotiation, making sure that we recognize that we don\u2019t need everything. We just need the right things. But also making sure that as we go forward, we are looking at multi-platform rights. We will not do deals where we don\u2019t get multi-platform rights to give us that very flexibility that we talked about toggling between sort of the more linear traditional legacy distribution channels and that of the more digital forward-looking platforms. The big one that\u2019s coming up, obviously, for us would be the NBA. We would love to be in business with the NBA. But again, we are going to do it in a fiscally responsible way and seeking multi-platform rights. So, we feel really good about our position going forward with the rights that we have already got and the one or two that are still in play.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you.\nMichael Morris: Thank you.\nAlexia Quadrani: I think with that, we will conclude the call. I think we are out of time.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we will conclude today\u2019s conference call. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.\nAlexia Quadrani: Okay. Thanks. Note that \u2013 I have to read a statement here, for those of you that are still on.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Alexia Quadrani, Senior VP of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani: Good afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to The Walt Disney Company's third quarter 2022 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast and a replay and transcript will also be available on our website. Joining me for today's call are Bob Chapek, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we will be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nBob Chapek: Thank you, Alexia, and good afternoon, everyone. We had an excellent quarter powered by world-class storytelling, outstanding performance at our domestic theme parks, increases in live sports viewership across our linear channels and ESPN+ and significant subscriber growth at our streaming services which added 15.5 million subscriptions in the quarter, including 14.4 million Disney+ subscribers, of which 6 million were core Disney+ and 8 million were Hotstar. As of the close of Q3, we now have 221 million total subscriptions across our streaming offerings. Our results showcase the ability of The Walt Disney Company\u2019s uniquely diversified business to power our ecosystems and explore growth opportunities across industries and distributions channels. I\u2019ll expand on all this and more and then Christine will go through the details of our results and provide additional insight into our fiscal 2024 expectations for Disney+. Creative excellence in storytelling that builds deep emotional connections with audiences is at the root of our success. And I am pleased to say that our creative engines are firing on all cylinders across franchise, general entertainment and sports. In a testament to the depth, breadth and quality of our creative teams, we received 147 Primetime Emmy award nominations this year, including 92 for our streaming platforms and 21 for best program in a genre, recognition across formats and distribution channels with 47 different shows receiving nominations, including titles like Only Murders in the Building. Abbott Elementary, What We Do in the Shadows and The Dropout, right alongside shows from Disney, Marvel and Star Wars. And most recently, we received an additional 71 news and documentary Emmy nominations across ABC News, National Geographic, FX, Hulu and ESPN. In addition to critical and industry recognition, we are thrilled by the audience response to our general entertainment offerings, response that is enhanced by a distribution strategy that maximizes reach by taking advantage of the strength of both our linear and streaming channels. Given the multiple ways, we bring our content to audiences, we take a thoughtful approach to each distribution decision to determine the best strategy for each of our many high-quality titles and platforms. Some like the Buzz-Generating Candy, the Kardashians and The Bear may be best served as Hulu originals. Others like Abbott Elementary and The Old Man have become multiplatform hits by reaching different audience demographics, across both linear and streaming. And when it comes to our key franchise content, I could not be more proud of the teams at Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars. The hugely successful, Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness has earned nearly $1 billion at the global box office. And Thor: Love and Thunder, which premiered on July 8 has grossed over $700 million at the global box office and is the highest domestic grossing film of the Thor franchise. Pixar's Lightyear, marked the studios return to the big screen and the film debuted on Disney+ last week. Speaking of Disney+, which is now available in 155 markets after recently launching in 53 new territories, we released content with appeal across demographic groups including Obi-wan Kenobi and Ms. Marvel, as well as feature films like Disney's Chip n' Dale: Rescue Rangers and Disney Nature's: Polar Bear. As you know Disney+ is still a young business and we are learning more every day about the services ability to attract new fans to our powerhouse franchises. For example, in addition to driving engagement amongst tens of millions of existing Marvel fans, we have seen each new Disney+ original Marvel series, attract incremental viewership and new subscribers that hadn't previously engaged with Marvel content on the service, thanks to the episodic format that enables us to explore new characters and genres. The value of expanding the fan base is tremendous, and this new audience can then experience Marvel across our other offerings from consumer products to games to theme parks. Looking ahead Q4, will feature a fantastic Disney+ content slate, with the steady flow of key releases including Marvel's, She-Hulk, Attorney at Law, Lucas Films' Andor and Disney's Hocus Pocus 2 and we look forward to celebrating the second annual Disney+ Day on September 8 with activations across our synergy machine. Given the global nature of Disney+, we are thrilled to bring international music sensation BTS to the service, with an exclusive cinematic concert film and docuseries following the band's incredible journey. BTS and the K-Pop genre at large, carry massive global appeal and affinity, which will further extend our reach into that global fan base.  And we continue to step up our investment in international local originals, across formats including bringing the seventh season of Coffee With Karan, one of India's most popular talk shows exclusively to Disney+ Hotstar. On the theatrical side, we have a robust slate debuting later this year, including the highly anticipated Avatar: The Way of Water, our newest animated film Strange World and the final film in Marvel's Phase 4, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Excitement for this film is amazing and the trailer received more than 170 million views in its first 24 hours.  Turning to sports. Our industry-leading run of rights acquisitions positions us extremely well for the future. We will continue to focus on audience expansion and long-term profitability by being disciplined in our acquisition approach and making deliberate distribution decisions for each sport in the portfolio. The results of this approach were fantastic last quarter, as the Walt Disney Company was responsible for 47% of sports hours watched by the 18 to 49 demo in fiscal Q3. Our innovative NHL deal has been a difference-maker across platforms with the Stanley Cup playoff viewership up 60% over 2021 across cable and broadcast including significant year-over-year increases in younger demos and female viewers. We also secured exclusive TV rights for the upcoming 2023 to 2027 IPL season following a competitive process where we make disciplined bids with a focus on long-term value.  We are excited to continue offering IPL to our linear customers in India where growth potential exists for our portfolio of more than 70 channels that reaches 90% of pay cable and satellite TV homes in the region. Pay TV distribution in India continues to be a robust business with projected GDP growth expected to drive advertising and consumer spending. In fact, India is one of the only markets in which we are launching new linear channels.  Finally given the results of our recently completed Upfront, it is clear that our unmatched portfolio continues to be highly sought after by advertisers. Combined with our deep expertise in ad tech we are in a position of strength with record Upfront advertiser commitment leading into the launch of our ad-supported Disney+ tier. Since the launch of Disney+ advertisers have been asking for the opportunity to connect with audiences alongside the most premium brands in content and streaming.  As we shared earlier today, the Disney+ ad tier goes live on December 8 and we are taking a thoughtful approach by launching with a lower ad load and frequency to ensure a great experience for viewers. This approach coupled with strong advertiser demand translated into Disney+ earning industry-leading CPM rates at the most recent upfront.  Turning to our parks. This quarter featured new magic around the world and strong operating performance. All of our theme parks are now open and we continue to bring back more of the great experience that guests love that includes Character Meet and Greet, Nighttime Spectacular at Disneyland and Theatrical Performances. These offerings are not only big hits with guests, but also enable us to welcome more people into our parks each day. We continue to see strong revenue and profit growth at our Domestic Parks and Experience businesses. Even as our cruise ships and international visitation have yet to fully recover domestic demand at our theme parks continues to be strong and we are seeing continued progress in those businesses still recovering from the pandemic. At the same time the business model transformation we have achieved over the past few years have driven substantial increases in per capita spending and give us the flexibility to adapt should economic conditions change. We celebrated three major milestones for our Parks and Experience business this quarter each of which were priorities I said when I had the opportunity to lead our Parks team. First, the innovative and immersive new roller coaster, Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind opened an Epcot as part of the park's ongoing transformation to a place that is more family more timeless and more Disney. Second, we expanded the Disney Cruise Line fleet with a Disney Wish, which sailed its maiden voyage on July 14. This is the first of three new ships and is infused with Disney storytelling one-of-a-kind entertainment and a modern interior aesthetic. It is powered by liquefied natural gas one of the cleanest burning fuels available. And finally, Disneyland Paris opened Avengers Campus on July 20 completing the first phase of our ambitious expansion plan. The new immersive area features two new attractions, five action stunts encounters with Marvel superhero and theme restaurants. I had the opportunity to help open this new land with stars from the Marvel Cinematic Universe and our cast and I could not be more proud of the resort's ongoing transformation. Guests are responding in a big way to our enhanced offering at Disneyland Paris' per capita spending in Q3 was up over 30% versus 2019 a great sign of the site's potential for growth. I am incredibly pleased with our performance this quarter, our competitive position and the unique collection of assets and capabilities that sets us apart. Going forward, The Walt Disney Company's incredible employees cast members and creative teams will continue to transform entertainment by combining extraordinary storytelling with innovative technology to create an even larger more connected and magical Disney universe for families and fans around the world. With that, I'll hand it over to Christine. \nChristine McCarthy: Thanks, Bob and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our strong financial results this quarter with diluted earnings per share excluding certain items increasing to $1.09 versus $0.80 in the prior year quarter. At Parks, Experiences and Products, third quarter revenues increased by more than $3 billion and operating income increased by $1.8 billion versus the prior year reflecting improvements across both domestic and international parks and experiences. Demand at our domestic parks continues to exceed expectations with attendance on many days tracking ahead of 2019 levels. And our continued focus on improving the guest experience through the use of our reservation system to purposely manage capacity versus simply increasing volume has the added benefit of improving yield and optimizing overall economics. So even while the average daily attendance at our domestic parks across the first three quarters of this fiscal year was slightly below 2019, we have delivered significantly higher revenue and operating income over that same time period. This approach also provides flexibility with levers we can adjust if demand were to shift. Per capita spending at our domestic parks also remained strong increasing 10% versus Q3 of fiscal 2021 and over 40% versus fiscal 2019. And in another sign of the robust demand we have seen at our parks and resorts, occupancy at our domestic hotels in the third quarter was 90%. Looking ahead, domestic demand at our theme parks continues to look robust with current forward-looking hotel bookings and intent to visit roughly in line with pre-pandemic trends. Improvement at our international parks in the third quarter was driven by Disneyland Paris where both revenue and operating income exceeded 2019 levels. And we are seeing the same momentum well into Q4, as we continue to celebrate the 30th anniversary and the opening of Avengers Campus in July. Disneyland Paris' strong performance in the third quarter was partially offset by closure-related impacts at Shanghai Disney Resort, where the theme park was closed for all, but the last three days of the quarter. At the Media and Entertainment Distribution segment, third quarter revenues increased by over $1.4 billion versus the prior year, and operating income decreased by $645 million, as an increase at linear networks was more than offset by declines at direct-to-consumer and content sales licensing and other. Linear Networks operating income in the quarter increased 13% to approximately $2.5 billion, driven primarily by growth at our Domestic Channels. The increase at Domestic Channels reflects double-digit percentage operating income growth, at both Cable and Broadcasting. Growth at Cable was largely driven by higher advertising revenue and to a lesser extent a decrease in marketing costs and an increase in affiliate revenue. Advertising revenue at Cable benefited from the timing of the NBA Finals, which represented six of the top seven telecasts among the coveted P18 to 49 demo, across all networks this quarter. Note that the final aired in the third quarter this year versus the fourth quarter of the prior year. This timing impact in addition to the benefit of adding the NHL to our portfolio and strong pricing, from the continued strength of Live Sports, drove ESPN advertising revenue growth of nearly 40% year-over-year. Demand for Live Sports remains strong. However, due to the NBA Finals timing impact fourth quarter-to-date domestic cash advertising sales at ESPN are currently pacing down. Moving on to Broadcasting. Operating income increased versus the prior year due to higher results at both ABC, and our owned television stations. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased by 2% in the quarter. This was driven by six points of growth from higher rates, partially offset by a three point decrease from fewer subscribers. International Channels' operating income was comparable to the prior year, reflecting increased sports programming costs, partially offset by advertising revenue growth. Both of these trends were driven by the airing of 35 additional IPL cricket matches in the third quarter versus the prior year. Note that, results also benefited from the closure of certain channels over the past year. At Direct-to-Consumer, lower operating results across Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, reflect increased programming and production costs, in line with the guidance we gave last quarter, as we continue to strategically invest in our streaming businesses. At Disney+, we crossed the 150 million subscriber milestone and ended the third quarter with more than 152 million global paid subscribers a net addition of more than 14 million subs versus Q2. Strong Disney+ core net subscriber additions of six million reflect growth in existing markets as well as launches in over 50 new markets during the quarter, and we currently expect Disney+ core net additions in the fourth quarter to accelerate modestly versus Q3 and particularly in the domestic market. At Disney+ Hotstar subscribers increased by over eight million as the IPO concluded its 15th season in the quarter. Hulu added more than 600,000 subs during the quarter and ended the third quarter with 46.2 million paid subscribers and ESPN+ ended Q3 with 22.8 million paid subscribers, a net increase of about 0.5 million versus Q2. At content sales, licensing and other, operating results decreased in line with our expectations by about $160 million versus the prior year quarter, reflecting an unfavorable foreign exchange impact and lower TV, SVOD and home entertainment distribution results, partially offset by higher stage play and theatrical results. As it relates to foreign exchange, note that the overall impact to the company's segment operating income was only modestly negative in the quarter, as our FX hedging program continued to be effective in mitigating the impact that changes in exchange rates have on our businesses. As we continue to scale back on third party content licensing, we believe content sales, licensing and other results will continue to face headwinds and expect fourth quarter operating results will decrease versus the prior year by close to $100 million. Cash content spend across the company is now expected to total approximately $30 billion for fiscal 2022. This estimate is slightly lower than our previous guidance largely due to timing changes, and we expect annual cash content spend over the next couple of years to be roughly in the low $30 billion range as well. We are also revising our full year forecast for capital expenditures to $5 billion compared to fiscal 2021 CapEx of $3.6 billion. Our new expectation for 2022 is roughly $500 million lower than our previous guide, in part reflecting timing shifts of various projects across the company. Finally, before we move to Q&A, I want to spend some time sharing a few updates on our fiscal 2024 guidance for Disney+. We are providing more detail on subscriber targets by separating our guidance into two categories: core Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar. Excluding the impact of any significant future macro headwinds, our core Disney+ subscriber target range is 135 million to 165 million by the end of fiscal 2024, largely consistent with previously provided guidance that non-Hotstar Disney+ subscribers in 2024 would approximate 60% to 70% of the expected 230 million to 260 million total subscriber base. We are, however, updating subscriber guidance for Disney+ Hotstar to up to 80 million subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024. We intend to refine this target over time as subscriber visibility in India will be clearer once the ICC and BCCI cricket rights sales processes are completed. As you may know we recently made the disciplined decision to not proceed with the Indian Premier League digital rights and we'll evaluate these rights with that same discipline. As we sit here today, we remain confident that Disney+ will achieve profitability in fiscal 2024 and look forward to several upcoming catalysts including reaching a steady state of tentpole original content releases, delivery of premium general entertainment and international local originals and the upcoming launch of our ad-supported tier alongside the new pricing structure announced earlier today. And with that, I'll turn it back to Alexia and we would be happy to take your questions.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thanks Christine. As we transition to Q&A, we ask you please limit yourself to one question in order to help us get to as many analysts as possible today. And with that operator, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from Doug Mitchelson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. One question, there was so much to ask about. Why don't I go with this and I do appreciate you separating out the guidance between Hotstar and core Disney, but Parks were impressive this quarter. And as you talked about levers of demand were to shift, has the company satisfied pent-up demand from the pandemic at the Parks' point? Should we look at the go-forward basis is relatively normal trends? And I'm guessing you have a different answer for domestic versus international. And Christine I'd be curious if you'd put any meat on the bone regarding the levers if demand were to shift at the Parks? Thank you.\nChristine McCarthy: Sure. Thanks Doug. Our Parks certainly did have a fantastic quarter. And I just want to say that the parks team is the same team led by Josh D'Amaro that was able to manage through the COVID crisis that impacted the business significantly. They also were able to ramp back in on a very phased basis back to the recovery phase and they're now positioned for growth. So I just want to acknowledge that team for being a triple threat when it comes to being able to manage from very, very different vantage points based on the environment. As it relates to levers of demand some of the things we could do Doug we had limited the number of annual passes that we have across some of our businesses -- some of the Parks. And all of those come with some with the exception of the highest tiered priced annual passes. They all come with some blackout dates. So to the extent to which perhaps you had lightened demand, you could loosen up some of those to bring more people in the Park and just enjoy the Park and spend money while they're there. And also as it relates to demand we have not yet seen demand abate at all. And we still have many days when people cannot get reservations. So we're still seeing demand in excess of the reservations that we are making available for our guests.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will be from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne: Good afternoon. Bob can you talk a little bit about, sort of the research and insight you have into your streaming customer base that sort of informs the decision to take these price increases which on a percentage basis are pretty large, without really reducing net adds with from churn spiking as you implement these price increases? And maybe talk a little bit about, how the product that consumers will be paying for next year at these higher prices will compare to this year. And I'm just wondering are you planning to take similar pricing moves at least directionally outside the U.S. overtime? Thanks for the color.\nBob Chapek: Well, as you know, we launched at an extraordinarily compelling price across all the platforms that we have for streaming. I think it was easy to say that, we're probably the best value in streaming. And since that initial launch, we've continued to invest handsomely in our content as you know. We believe, because the increase in the investment over the past 2.5 years relative to a very good price point that we have plenty of room on price value. And we do not believe that there's going to be any meaningful long-term impact on our churn as a result. I mean, one only needs to look at our recent significant increase on ESPN+, which had the exact same impact of really no meaningful impact at all on our churn. And we believe that we've got plenty of price value room left to go.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will come from Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nSteven Cahall: Thanks. So the DPEP margins were really spectacular. I'm just wondering, what kind of trends you're seeing from international visitations. Were those strong in the quarter, or is that a tailwind to either per caps or hotel occupancy as you get into the back half of the year and you see more international traffic?\nChristine McCarthy: I'll take that one, Steve. The DPEP margins were indeed, very strong. One of the things that we've seen is, during the pandemic international visitation to our domestic park primarily Walt Disney World was basically non-existent. That has proceeded to come back and it has come back very nicely, but it is still below the traditional range that we've given you which is around 17% 18%, up to the low-20s. But it's made significant progress. And we expect the international visitation when it is fully back to actually be additive to margins, because those guests tend to stay longer at the parks and they spend more money when they're there as well.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nathanson: Thank you. I just wanted to dig a bit on the ad product at Disney+. What's your expectation for ad load or modernization per sub, given there's a $3 difference between the premium with no ads and the ad product? And maybe what you've learned from Hulu over the years, that informs your expectations on monetization. Thanks.\nBob Chapek: As you know, we've had a lot of experience with this on Hulu and a lot of success with this on Hulu. And we are walking before we run in terms of seeing what the market will bear in terms of an ad load. So we're going in very conservative upfront. But we believe that, there's probably going to be some more ultimate elasticity in that as well as we go forward. And we're just really thrilled that we're able to launch the Disney+ ad tier and expand our audience access through all these multiple price points that we're going to have. And as Christine had alluded to, the advertising demand since the launch of Disney+ is great. And we think that by taking a conservative approach in terms of that ad load upfront, it will give us the ability to expand if we need to and not have to go the other way, which I think would be a much bigger deal.\nChristine McCarthy: And the only other thing I'd add to that Michael is based on our Hulu experience that even current subscribers who have ad-free may choose to stay at the same price point with ads. The Hulu ad-supported tier has more subscribers than the ad-free. In fact, it's well over about \u2013 it's about two-third. And that's something that we can't anticipate that we'd have exactly the same behavior because it's a different demo that has Disney+ versus Hulu but that's the best indication that we have. But we expect the ad tier to be popular and we also expect some people to want to stay with ad-free.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question?\nOperator: And that question will come from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. Maybe switching gears a little bit to sports. Can you give us your thoughts on what the structure of an NBA renewal might look like? Would it be different? And in the past you've mentioned participating in sports betting. You have the best brand name. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit on timing of what you're thinking? And then just a follow-up to some of the comments. Just on \u2013 you launched a new cruise ship. Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of cruise demand overall? \nBob Chapek: I think you want to divide yourself. Okay. I'll talk about the MBA first. As you know, we've had a great history with the NBA, really proud of our partnership there. And the past season and the ratings for the finals have been absolutely extraordinary. So we're interested in a renewal with the NBA. But like all of our decisions that we make in terms of content, we'll only do it if it's accretive to shareholder value. And I think that remains the overall guidance, whether you're talking about India with IPL, whether you're talking about college sports, whether you're talking about Formula 1 racing or you're talking about NBA. So we have an interest to do that. We're really happy with our portfolio of sports rights that we have. But of course, the continued relationship with the NBA would be something that would be very attractive to us.\nChristine McCarthy: Do you want to take sports betting? \nBob Chapek: Yes. Well, in terms of sports betting we are \u2013 have been in conversations for quite a long time now with a number of different platforms to add some utility to sports betting and take away some friction for that for our guests. We have found that basically our sports fans that are under 30 absolutely require this type of utility in the overall portfolio of what ESPN offers. So we think it's important. We're working hard on it, and we hope to have something to announce in the future in terms of a partnership there that will allow us to access that revenue stream and also make sure that our guests are being \u2013 having their needs met.\nChristine McCarthy: So Jessica on cruise. As you know, we welcomed our fifth ship to our four ship fleet, so we now have five. The new ship goes by the name of Wish, as Bob mentioned, and it's quite an extraordinary vessel. But we've always said that that business has been the most severely impacted by COVID in terms of duration of disruption to the business. So we're still coming out of that, but we are focused on the business recovering. Historically, the cruise line has been terrific with really attractive ROICs for us and it's generated double-digit returns on the investment. And we expect that business to come back to the similarly attractive returns that we had previously experienced. And a couple of things. The WISH is our newest ship and that has gone with very, very high capacity. And that one it's just very well received. But we have a competitive position overall in the cruise business, especially the family cruise market. So we generate pricing that's well above the industry average. And our cruise ships deliver for us one of the highest rated guest experiences across all of our parks and experiences offerings. And this is a really interesting comment that we received from our cruise passengers. 40% of them say that they would not have chosen to go on a cruise vacation if it weren't a Disney Cruise. So we're a unique product and we're still a relatively small share of the cruise market and we're positioned for growth. And the other four ships are all sailing and their occupancy is improving week by week.\nAlexia Quadrani: Next question please.\nOperator: Next question is from Kutgun Maral from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKutgun Maral: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. One on the parks and then a follow-up on FX if I could. First, the parks are going through a particularly innovative and transformative period given your investments in technology, digital tools and improvements in the guest experience. So from the outside, it seems that the business is as well positioned as it's ever been in the face of a potential recession. But I'd love to get your views on the various sensitivities associated with what the consumer is seeing and how you'd characterize the resiliency of the business. I know you talked about different levers at your disposal, but perhaps there's been a structural change in the business compared to prior recessionary periods that you could speak to? And then Christine, if I could follow up on your foreign exchange commentary. Can you share a bit more on how you manage your FX risk? And what was the impact of FX on DTC ARPU? Thank you.\nBob Chapek: Yeah. I think a lot of onlookers look at our park business and try to sum up our success recently and say that it has something to do with pent-up demand. And certainly, there is pent-up demand. But what we're seeing is far more resilient, far more long lasting in terms of increase in the affinity for our parks both from the willingness to come to our parks and its attendance, but also in terms of what guests are willing to spend when they get there in order to personalize their experience. As you know, everything we do in our parks is all about improving the guest experience. And part of that has to do with limiting capacity, but also about personalizing those experiences. So we believe we do have a lot of flexibility to shift, if our demand changes. Remember, we have a reservation system which now enables us essentially real time on the fly to change whatever factors we need in terms of our ticket packaging that we want where years ago we didn't have that. We published our prices by the quarter and that was essentially all the flexibility we had. But as you know our business looks very strong with forward-looking bookings and intent at pre-pandemic levels and we see nothing in the future that's indicating anything to the contrary of what we've seen. So we're very pleased with that. I should also remind you that our reservation system really does a great job at spreading demand. So if we see any spikiness, we can actually smooth that in a way that we couldn't before. And we're real pleased with that because even our Genie product, which as you know we released just a little bit short of a year ago, now about 50% of the people that come through the gate, actually buy up to that Genie product which I think you can see the result of in our yields. \nChristine McCarthy: And I'll take the question on foreign exchange and the way we hedge. So, we do have a hedging policy that is well established and has really served the company well over very volatile foreign exchange markets. So, just level set, we have a program and the goal of it is to reduce the impact that changes in foreign exchange rates have on our current and future earnings. So, we really have an objective of trying to attain earnings and cash flow stability and predictability. So, we try to take out the ups and the downs. So, the hedging program it has significantly reduced the negative earnings impact of the strong dollar that we've seen both in the third quarter as well as the fiscal year-to-date. And so despite being economically hedged as it relates to ARPU, we do not allocate the hedge gains or losses specifically to ARPU in the various markets. So, therefore, the reported ARPU for international Disney+ was impacted by the unfavorable exchange rates in the quarter. Another thing is when you look at content sales and licensing, especially if you go back and look at the transcript, you'll note that there was a reference to that also being impacted by negative foreign exchange. That was just a balance sheet ineffectiveness. We also hedge the balance sheet. And that had to do more with we based our hedging on forecasted plans. And if the plans come in stronger and were underhedged or overhedged, in this case we were it did not benefit us because we were hedged the right way for the dollar strengthening, but that is a one-timer that should not be repeated. But as it relates to ARPU, if you have some volatility, you will see it in the ARPU, but it nets out as a company overall. As I mentioned in my other comments that this is not a material item for us on a consolidated basis. You just saw it spike out, especially in DMED. And the other thing is we do hedging on a multiyear basis. So, we layer in our hedges over a period of time, which has really served us well in the current environment. \nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: And the next question is from in Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. So, maybe Bob from a strategic perspective, when you think about sports, it does seem like that there are a lot of new entrants. I mean Apple seems to be interested in more and more sports rates. And from your perspective, you obviously walked away from the cricket rights in India and it looks like Big 10 may also be going in a different direction. So, when you think about sports strategically, given that cord cutting is structural, how do you think about this business longer term? Do you really have to own ESPN or get into sports streaming in a much bigger way or invest a lot more? I mean directionally, they are off of it obviously from a decision perspective. So, it would be great to get a sense for how you're thinking about sports more broadly? And then on the advertising side, if I could just ask a bigger picture question around Disney+. From a subscriber base perspective, Disney+ is comparable domestically to Hulu and US is the biggest ad market when it comes to the television opportunity. So when we think about the scale of advertising for Disney+, is Hulu the kind of benchmark we should be thinking about, or can Disney+ be much bigger because it is international in scale all those CPMs are much lower outside the US? So if you could just help us scale that opportunity that would be great? Thanks.\nBob Chapek : Okay. In terms of the strategy on sports, we're continually enamored by the power sports in terms of viewership and what it adds to our overall portfolio particularly in an advertising type world. As you know, we get strong cash flows on linear and it helps to pay some of the bills in the companies we make some of our significant investments in content, and we also like the proposition of growth and expansion on our DTC.. In terms of the rights, if you look at the college rights, we've got the SEC, we've got the ACC, we've got the Pac-12. We've got the Big 12. We've got the play off. We've got the most comprehensive programming. So if we don't get rights in every single conference, we don't believe that's in any way limiting for us. But what we're all preparing for is the future of what ESPN would look like in a direct-to-consumer -- in a true direct-to-consumer fashion. And I think the way that we're looking at this is that we want to proactively prepare for that future without prematurely disrupting the cash flow that we get from the linear networks right now. And as you know we've negotiated flexibility into our rights agreements across the board for any new rights that we have acquired over the last several years, but we're still bullish on sports. We believe there's tremendous degrees of freedom in terms of what ESPN DTC ultimately looks like. I think we're very proud of what we've done to-date on ESPN+, but that no way limits how we envision what true ESPN DTC proposition would look like going into the future. \nChristine McCarthy: Hi, Kannan. Thank you for asking this question about advertising. I know there's been a lot written recently about ad trends. But I just want to start off by saying pacing in our scatter market continues to be solid across streaming sports, as well as our broadcast network. Now to get to your question about Disney+ AVOD and the scale, first of all, we are going to launch later this year, as Bob said, December 8. And we're taking an intentionally limited approach to it, meaning, we're launching with a lower ad load and a lower frequency than say Hulu. And so this will ensure a great experience for viewers, and these viewers are different then, because a lot of them are families and you have a lot of adults at Hulu, but it's a different viewing experience. But because of that disciplined lower ad load, lower frequency and the strong advertising, demand that we've had that translates into some of the industry-leading CPM rates at the most recent upfront for Disney+. And then we look at beyond domestic, what we can do internationally, and we plan to go international sometime next year. And we've built these strong advertising relationships around the world with our previously existing and currently existing linear footprint. So we're confident in our ability to navigate the international advertising marketplace given our depth of knowledge and experience with the traditional linear business. So, we really feel well suited to deliver both domestically on Disney+ AVOD, as well as international.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: And that question is from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPhil Cusick: Hi. Thank you. One and a follow-up on DTC. First, Christine, there were higher DTC and Disney+ programming costs than we expected this quarter. Can you give us some direction of where to go in the fourth quarter? And when should we expect those Disney+ operating income losses to peak? And then second, if you could dig into the guidance to acceleration of subs in the fourth quarter. I think that's an acceleration in the total subs and then you set a higher mix of growth toward domestic? Thank you.\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. Let me start first with the acceleration of subs. I did mention that that we expect acceleration of subs to be -- especially in the domestic market to be modestly above where we are now. But you will see growth in Q4 and we feel good about that because of the content releases we have and just the existing shows that are on. Peak losses, we expect peak losses -- as of today, we expect Disney+ to reach peak losses in this current fiscal year '22. So that is something that is consistent with what we've previously said. As it relates to higher costs of content and programming, we have said that, we have -- this is a peak year of losses which includes those costs. But also, we expect as we go into developing our full slate that the next quarter you will see a similar increase year-over-year that you saw this quarter.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: And that question is from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBrett Feldman: Hi. Thanks. And if you don't mind I'd like to follow up with the question about the ad experience on Disney+. And it's only two things, I was hoping you could comment on. The first is, would you expect to potentially display ads alongside any of the content? Some of that content including some of the kids' content I think historically in a linear world didn't necessarily have ads alongside of it. So I'm just thinking about that element of it. And then secondly, you have a competitor that's looking to layer advertising into their product, they're suggesting that, they're going to somehow do it differently. And I'm just curious, as you think about the experience you've had in streaming advertising. Are you mostly going to look to leverage the formats you've used very successfully with Hulu, or do you actually think there may be an opportunity to use some innovative new formats on Disney+ for ads? Thank you.\nBob Chapek: I should say that the technology for Disney+ is a completely different platform than the Hulu platform. So, while we certainly have tremendous learnings over the years, in terms of how to do addressable advertising and we've done that at the advantage of our shareholders' result. I will have to say that, we are not encumbered by that or in any way limited by what we've done in the past. Therefore, we could have an ad proposition as good as the one that we've had on Hulu, but it could actually be better because of that different technology platform. So, it has the ability to evolve over time much more on the new platform than it does in the old platform.\nChristine McCarthy: And as it relates to the ad experience Brett, it's not all content on Disney+ being treated equally. There will be no ads in kid's profiles or preschool at least at the launch. And so this is going to be done very thoughtfully and looking at the content and also making sure that the advertiser is consistent with the content.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Operator, I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Sure. And that question is from Bryan Kraft from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Kraft: Hi, good afternoon. Christine there's been a heavy working capital use year-to-date in fiscal 2022 both from cash content cost as well as what we traditionally think about as working capital. Can you just talk about your outlook for the rest of the year and the prospects for some of that reversing in 4Q and to next year? And then I was wondering if you could also comment briefly just on tax. I think you've had an elevated tax rate this year. You talked about it last quarter. Is that something that's going to extend into 2023? And if you could just provide any color around what some of the factors are driving that? Thank you.\nChristine McCarthy: Sure. So on working capital, we have seen net working capital outflows as our businesses are getting back up and running and going back to more normalized operations after they were turned down during the pandemic. And you'll see in this quarter, we did generate positive free cash flow of $187 million in the quarter. On taxes, our effective -- annual effective tax rate has generally been correlated with the US statutory rate. But there are a lot of things on a quarterly basis. We call them puts and takes in any given period. And these can lead to these quarterly variances. But we still expect our full year 2022 tax rate is going to be somewhat elevated above the US statutory rate similar to what you saw. And for Q4 it could even be slightly above Q3. As it relates to fiscal 2023, we're just working now through our annual operating plan. And I don't want to get too specific today but it's one of the factors we keep a close eye on as it relates to our ability to utilize foreign tax credits. And that ability to utilize foreign tax credits has been the source of some volatility that you've seen especially in Q2 tax rate.\nAlexia Quadrani: Okay. Thanks for the question. I want to thank everybody for joining us as well. And for your convenience we will be posting the pricing schedule and updated content slate on our website.

Joining me for today's call are Bob Chapek, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we will be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nBob Chapek: Thanks, Alexia, and good afternoon, everyone. In Q2, Disney's employees and cast members continued to execute against our strategic priorities of storytelling excellence, innovation and audience focus, and I could not be more proud of what they've achieved. Our strong results this quarter, including fantastic performance at our domestic parks and continued growth at our streaming services, along with the creative achievements of our content teams once again proved that we are in a league of our own. We have entertainment's most iconic brands and the world's favorite franchises, a high-quality creative pipeline that will continue to drive engagement and consumption and an unrivaled synergy machine with touch points that reach audiences across distribution channels, geographies and demographics, all of which come together to create a deep emotional connection with audiences across generations. I'd like to share a few highlights from the quarter that illustrate these strengths, and then Christine will go through the details of our results. As I said, our domestic parks were a standout. They continue to fire on all cylinders, powered by strong demand, coupled with customized and personalized guest experience enhancements that grew per capita spending by more than 40% versus 2019. Response to next-generation storytelling like Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser has been phenomenal. In fact, guest ratings for this immersive experience, which opened March 1, are incredibly high and in line with our best-in-class offerings. Demand is strong, and we expect 100% utilization through the end of Q3. Looking ahead, we could not be more excited to officially welcome riders on Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind at Epcot on May 27. One of the longest indoor rollercoasters in the world, the attraction puts guests in the middle of an exciting adventure as they're called on to help the Guardians out of a jam. With our first-ever reverse launch and rotating cars that turn riders 360 degrees, guests won't miss a second of the story during our most immersive coaster experience yet. At Disneyland Paris, we are thrilled to take the next step in our ambitious expansion plan, the opening of Avengers Campus this summer as part of the resort's 30th anniversary celebration. As Europe recovers from the pandemic, we've seen strong yield growth at Disneyland Paris and look forward to its continued recovery. Another standout this quarter were our streaming services. We ended Q2 with more than 205 million total subscriptions after adding 9.2 million in the quarter. That includes 7.9 million Disney+ subscribers, keeping us on track to reach 230 million to 260 million Disney+ subscribers by fiscal '24. The growth of the platform since its launch reinforces its unique nature. Quite simply, we believe Disney+ is one of a kind, a service based on exceptional branded content with wide appeal across all 4 quadrants. It's certainly popular with families, but as a reminder, almost half of Disney+ subscribers are adults without kids. In recognition of Disney+'s unique ability to attract viewers from a range of demographic groups, we are selectively enhancing Disney+ with general entertainment titles designed to drive sign-ups amongst specific audiences and deepen engagement amongst those cohorts. A benefit of our incredible creative engines and decades of general entertainment excellence is that we can reach these demographics not only through the creation of original titles but also by shifting resources from across our content ecosystem, especially as consumer behavior continues to evolve. Our strategy is not just to fill our distribution pipelines but to be thoughtful with each asset to best position it amongst our various distribution options. For instance, Dancing with the Stars is a beloved show that has entertained viewers for more than 30 seasons on ABC and is a wonderful example of content that brings the whole family together. We recently announced Disney+ will be the series\u2019 new home starting this fall. Beyond targeting specific demos, we are equally enthusiastic about our growth potential in international markets. We currently have over 500 local original titles in various stages of development and production. 180 of those titles are slated to premiere this fiscal year, increasing to over 300 international originals per year in steady state. We believe these premium local originals, along with branded content with broad international appeal, will attract new subscribers and drive engagement. One example in production is Nautilus from our EMEA team. Based on 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Nautilus is the origin story of the iconic submarine from the perspective of its mysterious commander, Captain Nemo. This is just one example of how our global network of creative hubs can develop and produce original content with worldwide appeal. And by the end of Q3 we plan to roll out Disney+ to 53 new markets across Europe, Africa and West Asia, starting with South Africa next week. Before leaving Disney+, I want to mention our recently announced plans to introduce an ad-supported subscription offering in the U.S. by the end of the calendar year and internationally in 2023. Expanding Disney+ access through multiple price points is a win for consumers and advertisers. Of course, all of our success is rooted in great content. Our general entertainment team continued its string of phenomenal series with Hulu's Pam & Tommy and The Dropout. And while not in the quarter we could not be happier with the performance of the Kardashians. More great general entertainment content is ahead, like the second season of Only Murders in the Building on Hulu and the record-breaking 19th season of ABC's Grey's Anatomy. This quarter, our studios earned 6 Academy awards, including best Animated Feature for Walt Disney Animation Studios, Encanto; and Best Documentary Feature for Onyx Collective and Searchlight Pictures Summer of Soul. Pixar Animation Studios Turning Red premiered on March 11 on Disney+ and became the fastest title to reach 200 million hours viewed on the platform. The Disney+ original series Star Wars: The Book of Boba Fett drew positive reaction from audiences, and Marvel's Moon Knight continue the studio's impressive track record. Looking ahead, our studios will continue to deliver high-quality content at scale with an exciting array of series and films coming to all of our distribution channels. In fact, our slate for the remainder of this year is incredibly strong with titles like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ms. Marvel, Lightyear, Thor: Love and Thunder, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and the long anticipated Avatar: The Way of Water. Finally, I must mention the phenomenal success of Marvel's Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which opened to roughly $450 million worldwide this past weekend. Domestically, it was the second-highest opening of the pandemic era and the 11th highest opening of all time. Our strategy of distribution flexibility has worked well for us, and these fantastic results are another sign of our ability to succeed no matter the platform. That success extends to sports. ESPN viewership was notably strong for the quarter across both live events and studio programming with ratings up double digits, and we remain encouraged by how fans are engaging with sports content coming out of the pandemic. Opening weekend of the NBA Playoffs was the most viewed in the past decade, and the ratings have been fantastic with over 4.3 million average viewers through 20 games on ABC and ESPN. Our ground-breaking NHL deal is unique in its exposure across ESPN, ESPN+, ABC and Hulu, culminating with the Stanley Cup Playoffs, which began on May 2. In fact, the combination of the NHL and NBA Playoffs going on simultaneously kicks off an exciting stretch of championship programming that also includes Wimbledon, the NCAA Women's and Men's College World Series, UFC Boxing and more. Coming off the success of Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli, we recently debuted our new season-long MLB alternative broadcast, KayRod Cast with Michael Kay and Alex Rodriguez. And we began the inaugural season of PGA TOUR Live on ESPN+, featuring over 4,000 hours of live golf coverage from 35 tournaments. Before I hand it over to Christine, I want to say a few words about our unique synergy machine or franchise flywheel, if you prefer. What sets Disney apart is our ability to reach people with our uniquely engaging content across an array of touch points to make our portfolio of businesses and brands a bigger part of their lives. This enables us to not only create new franchises like Encanto, but to also build on existing IP across our lines of business. One example of this is our Toy Story franchise, which was created almost 3 decades ago with the release of the first film in 1995 and which is now brought to life across distribution platforms, geographies, businesses and time. In our parks, we've built a portfolio of 4 immersive Toy Story lands with more than 20 attractions and live character interactions available around the world as well as 2 themed hotels. The franchise is the cornerstone of Disney+ with all 4 feature-length films as well as the original short series, Forky Asks a Question, exclusively available on the service. And nearly 30 years after the film debuted, Toy Story is still a key consumer products franchise, generating over $1 billion in annual retail sales. And in just a few weeks, Pixar's Lightyear will tell the origin story of everyone's favorite Space Ranger when it hits theaters on June 17. Of course, Toy Story is just one of our many franchises, but it illustrates our unparalleled ability to bring stories to life in more ways for more people in more places. In fact, our franchise library and capabilities will continue to set us apart even further as we bring our IP to life through next-generation storytelling that is more integrated and connected across consumer touch points. As we look to our second century, that's our mission: to transform entertainment by combining extraordinary storytelling with innovative technology to create an even larger, more connected and magical Disney universe for families and fans around the world. With that, I'll hand it over to Christine.\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the fiscal second quarter were $1.08, an increase of $0.29 versus the prior year quarter. We continue to be pleased with our financial results with total segment operating income increasing by 50% versus the prior year quarter and by over 80% year-to-date. Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment continued to show strong signs of growth and recovery as operating income increased by nearly $2.2 billion year-over-year to approximately $1.8 billion. Growth was primarily driven by our domestic parks, which were open for the entire quarter. In the prior year, Walt Disney World was open, but Disneyland was closed for the entire quarter. We continue to be pleased with the overall demand and attendance trends at our domestic parks. In fact, there were many days in the quarter where we saw demand exceed 2019 levels. However, we are continuing to control attendance through our reservation system with an eye on delivering a quality guest experience. As Bob mentioned earlier, per capita guest spending at our domestic parks increased by over 40% versus Q2 of fiscal 2019 and by 20% versus Q2 of fiscal 2021 with increases across the board on admissions, food and beverage and merchandise. Looking ahead to the third quarter. Our forward-looking demand pipeline at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland remains robust. And while attendance from international visitation is still in the early days of recovery, we are beginning to see some improvements. We are also thrilled that as of the end of March, all of our domestic resorts are now open, a major milestone as we continue to move through the impacts of the pandemic. At our international parks, operating results improved versus the prior year due to growth at Disneyland Paris, which was open in Q2 and closed during the prior year quarter. This was partially offset by lower results at Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disney, both of which were impacted by COVID-related closures in the quarter. Consumer Products operating income increased in the quarter, reflecting higher sales of merchandise based on several of our iconic franchises, including Mickey and Minnie, Spider-Man, Star Wars and Disney Princess. Moving on to the Media & Entertainment Distribution segment. Second quarter operating income decreased by approximately $900 million versus the prior year as revenue growth of about $1.2 billion, primarily driven by direct-to-consumer was more than offset by higher expenses, including programming and production expenses at Linear Networks and Direct-to-Consumer, which came roughly in line with the guidance we gave last quarter. At our Linear Networks business, operating income in the quarter was $2.8 billion or roughly flat versus the prior year as modest growth at our domestic channels was offset by a decline at our international channels. Domestically, higher operating income at Broadcasting was partially offset by lower results at Cable. Broadcasting results benefited year-over-year from affiliate revenue growth in addition to higher advertising revenue due to the timing of the Academy Awards, which aired in Q2 this year versus Q3 last year. These impacts were partially offset by higher programming and production costs also driven by the timing of the Academy Awards. At Cable, lower operating income versus the prior year was primarily due to an increase in programming and production costs. The largest component of the increased cost was driven by 4 additional NFL games versus the prior year, consisting of 3 regular season games as well as the return of the Pro Bowl. These impacts were partially offset by growth in cable advertising and affiliate revenue. Advertising revenue at ESPN increased by over 30% in the quarter, and third quarter-to-date domestic cash advertising sales at ESPN are currently pacing up significantly benefiting from a return to a pre-COVID NBA schedule that is driving increased viewership and pricing. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased by 5% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by 7 points of growth from higher rates, partially offset by a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Operating income at our international channels decreased versus the prior year, driven by lower affiliate revenue and an increase in programming and production costs, partially offset by advertising revenue growth. At Direct-to-Consumer, operating losses widened to almost $900 million due to higher losses at Disney+ and ESPN+ and lower operating income at Hulu. The higher losses at our DTC services were largely driven by higher programming and production expenses in line with what we noted in our guidance last quarter. At Disney+, programming and production costs grew along with marketing and technology costs to support our growth around the world, partially offset by higher subscription revenue. We ended the quarter with nearly 138 million global paid Disney+ subscribers, reflecting close to 8 million net additions from Q1. A little over half of those net adds were from Disney+ Hotstar, which benefited from the start of the new IPL season towards the end of the second quarter. Internationally, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, we added over 2 million paid subscribers versus the first quarter with Latin America being the strongest contributor, driven by growth of the Combo+ offering. Domestically, net adds of approximately 1.5 million reflect in part the success of tentpole content releases, including Turning Red and Moon Knight as well as the strength of our bundled and multiproduct offerings. ESPN+ ended Q2 with 22.3 million paid subscribers, a net increase of about 1 million versus Q1. Operating results decreased compared to the prior year due to higher sports programming costs and lower pay-per-view income, partially offset by subscription revenue growth. And at Hulu, which ended the second quarter with 45.6 million paid subscribers, higher subscription and advertising revenues versus the prior year were more than offset by higher programming and production, marketing and technology costs. Moving on to content sales, licensing and other. Results decreased by approximately $300 million versus the prior year, driven by lower TV and SVOD results, which we discussed in our guidance last quarter, in addition to a decrease in home entertainment results. As a reminder, these impacts are deliberately aligned with our strategic decision to utilize our content on our own direct-to-consumer services. Before I touch on a few things that we'd like you to keep in mind for the back half of the fiscal year, I'll quickly note 2 other relevant items for the second quarter. We recognized a revenue reversal of $1 billion related to the early termination of content licensing agreements with a customer in order to make that content available on our own direct-to-consumer services. Because substantially all of the consideration we received was recognized as revenue at the time that content was originally made available in previous years, we've recorded amounts to terminate the agreement net of remaining amounts of deferred revenue as a revenue reversal. Finally, a note on the impact of some tax-related items on our Q2 EPS. Our diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items of $1.08 includes an adverse impact of approximately $0.11 due to the impact of higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of a recent change in U.S. tax regulations. It's worth mentioning that while our annual effective tax rate has generally been correlated with the U.S. statutory rate, there are many complex puts and takes in any given period, which can lead to these variances quarter-to-quarter. And we currently expect the full year tax rate could remain somewhat elevated above the U.S. statutory rate. Now as it relates to the third quarter and the second half of fiscal 2022. At DPEP, closures at our Asia theme parks could adversely impact operating income in the third quarter by up to approximately $350 million versus the prior year. As a reminder, Hong Kong Disneyland was closed for the first 3 weeks of the quarter. Shanghai Disney has been closed quarter-to-date, and we do not yet have visibility to a reopening date. As we continue to strategically prioritize leveraging our content for our own services, we expect content sales, licensing and other operating results to decrease in the third quarter by approximately $150 million to $200 million versus the prior year. The expected decrease is primarily driven by declines in content licensing along with a continued decline in home entertainment results. Direct-to-Consumer programming and production costs in Q3 are expected to increase by more than $900 million year-over-year, reflecting higher original content expense at Disney+ and Hulu increased sports rights costs and higher programming fees at Hulu Live. At Disney+, while we still expect higher net adds in the second half of the year versus the first half, it's worth mentioning that we did have a stronger-than-expected first half of the year. Additionally, note that some of the Eastern European markets were launching in towards the end of Q3, including Poland, are in regions being impacted by geopolitical factors. As it relates to content spend, we previously stated that we expect fiscal year 2022 cash content spend to total as much as $33 billion. We've adjusted that amount to as much as $32 billion to reflect a slightly slower cadence of spending than anticipated during the first half of the year. Note that we are still expecting a strong content slate in the back half of the year. And as Bob mentioned, we are confident in our long-term subscriber guidance of 230 million to 260 million Disney+ subs by fiscal 2024. We also still expect that Disney+ will achieve profitability in fiscal 2024. And with that, I'll turn it back to Alexia, and we would be happy to take your questions.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you, Christine. We are happy to be back here in person for this call. But to make it easier, I will help direct the questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question in order to help us get to as many analysts as possible today.  And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Your first question is from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman : Bob touched on pricing to some degree during his comments. So I thought we could come back to that. One of the questions we've been getting is, how do you think about the right cadence for revisiting pricing on Disney+ really when you can take price higher? It just seems like there's a lot of factors that would go into that, including the fact you'll be launching a new ad-supported tier. You're putting a lot more content onto the service. You've seen some increased competition. And obviously, there's some inflationary pressures, and I'm just not quite sure if you put all that to a pot what that yields in terms of how you're thinking about pricing.\nBob Chapek : All right. Thank you. As you know, we launch with an extremely attractive opening price point on Disney+, and we've been very comfortable with the price-value relationship that we've offered. And as you know, as we increase our content investment, we believe that that's going to give us the ability to adjust our price by -- and still, at the same time, maintain that strong value proposition. You mentioned the Disney+ ad tier I think this is going to give us the ability to reach an even more broad audience as we expand Disney+ across multiple price points. And using some of our other services, we can see the additive nature of an ad-driven service that enables us to keep the price lower. Of course, that's made up for by the additional revenue that we would get per user on the advertising spending. So we believe that we can sort of move up and cascade up our net price over time given the tremendous value that we started with and the increased price-value relationship of all the new content, but we're pretty bullish about that. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne: A question, and if I can, Alexia, just a clarification from the prepared remarks. On parks, as you know, you'll start to lap some really strong significant double-digit per capita growth as you move through the rest of the summer and into the fall. And I'm just wondering, particularly given how focused everybody is on the economy and inflation, the consumer, if you're seeing any signs that would suggest that you're going to see substantial deceleration or even maybe not grow your per capita growth at the domestic parks. Just be curious on how you're thinking about the full year and as you lap these comparisons. And then I just wanted to come back, Christine, on the second half net adds. Are you still expecting a stronger second half at Disney+ than the first half and you're just calling out that maybe the relative comparison won't be as pronounced? I just wanted to make sure I understood what you -- we understood what you were saying.\nAlexia Quadrani : Bob, why don't you take the first half and then Christine can follow up.\nBob Chapek : Okay. So we continue to see really strong demand, and we're encouraged by the trends that we're seeing, particularly as we're going to get some improvements to international visitation. But we're controlling our attendance, as Christine mentioned in her comments, using our reservation system to optimize the guest experience. But that domestic yield strategy, and we're also seeing it in Paris, is really exceeding our expectations. If you remember, last quarter, we mentioned that we had some high hopes for it, but we were seeing well above what we had anticipated. While I'm happy to say that in Q2 or even, as you say, we're lapping those numbers again even higher. So we're very, very encouraged by the continuation of the trends that we're seeing in terms of the number of people. For example, that sign-up for Genie+, plus the willingness to come to our parks with our balanced reservation system, which really helps us sort of manage our price per day, if you will. So that domestic yield strategy has really structurally allowed us to increase that per capita spending meaningfully without having to rely solely on raising ticket prices, and we don't see any end in sight for that.\nChristine McCarthy : Great. Ben, your question on net adds for the second half of the year, we still do expect an increase over the first half. However, the first half came in better than expected, so that delta that we had initially anticipated may not be as large. But we still do expect an increase in the second half to exceed the first half.\nOperator: Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.\nMichael Nathanson : I have 2. First would be, Bob, it seems that the equity markets are now focused on kind of the cost to achieve subscriber growth and maybe not just focused on the sub numbers as much as the cost to achieve. So I wonder with you, given the rising content costs you're seeing in things like sports and competition around the globe, how do you measure maybe the need to drive shareholder returns versus attaining those sub targets that were laid out in 2020? And how do you -- and how and when will you determine what the ROIC would be on maybe the next 100 million subs versus the first 100 million subs? And then, Christine, can you talk a bit about any type of incremental margins at the parks? Very strong so far, halfway through the year. Any type of inflation on the parks that could limit maybe the margin growth we've seen at this point?\nBob Chapek : So as you know, we're very carefully watching our content growth -- content cost growth. And we reaffirmed, as you heard earlier, our targets, our guidance on both subs and on profitability. So we think they move together. It's obviously a balancing act, but we believe that great content is going to drive our subs, and those subs then in scale will drive our profitability. So we don't see them as necessarily counter. We see them as sort of consistent with the overall approach that we've laid out. We're extremely happy with the content that we've got, both across the general entertainment option, which frankly is -- you heard that 50% of our subs are families without kids. And so at the same time, that relative content expenditure is a little cheaper than our typical franchise expenditure on a per-program basis. So even though we're adding a lot of content both in local, international markets and as well in the general entertainment area, it doesn't come at the per-title level, if you will, that we've been seeing sort of to date on our general franchise films. That said, we're balancing all 3. And we're very confident that going forward, we're going to hit both of those sub guidance and profitability guidance by bringing in the cost at a reasonable level relative to their ability to attract and retain our subs.\nChristine McCarthy : Hi, Michael. On the parks margins, as Bob said, we feel really good about the consumer demand and what we're seeing in the forward-looking bookings and everything else in the attendance levels. So we feel good about that portion of margins. The one that is more challenging is what we face with inflation. But we do pay close attention to all the recent inflationary pressures, and it covers everything from merchandise to food and beverage. I'll give you an example of something -- for those, we are actually always looking at mitigating impacts of rising costs. But I'll give you a good example of one that we are executing on, and that is the increased cost in fuel. We have a very robust fuel hedging program at Walt Disney World, and that reduces risk and minimizes volatility, reduces volatility in the cost of fuel. And so that -- while we suspended that program while the parks were shut, we have reopened that program and we are doing what we can to minimize the impact on that particular cost. We do have the labor impacts. Rising wages is something everybody is dealing with and a tighter labor market. On the supply chain, our business isn't immune to the global supply chain challenges. And to the extent we experience any product availability impacts given strong demand that we're seeing, we're working with our suppliers to diversify some of our suppliers, and we're also working with shippers to expedite the time to receive those through shipping. But right now, it's very difficult to accurately forecast the potential financial impact due to the fluidity of the situation. But you can trust that we are fully aware of it, and we're working hard to mitigate any pressure on the margins.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, next question?\nOperator: From Jessica Rief Ehrlich with Bank of America.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich : I have one big question, one multipart. Can you -- with the upfronts coming next week, can you give us some -- any color on how you're thinking about what this year's effort will be like given changes in measurement, multiple platforms that you're selling across and, of course, the economy? And staying with the theme on -- given your upcoming rollout of the AVOD platform for Disney+, you already have Hulu ad inventory, and now you're adding Disney+. Do you think this will grow the pie overall for Disney advertising dollars? Or will this ultimately just drive share shift from traditional broadcast linear? Is it incremental or not? How are you thinking about that? And how much do you think that having an ad-supported service will increase overall TAM for subscribers?\nBob Chapek : Okay. Let's see. I'm going to take the first part first. We're expecting a very positive reaction from advertisers overall. And as you suggest, this is a combination of our excitement around the Disney+ ad tier. They have been asking for this for years. And we also expect Hulu, as you know, which has been very strong for us at the same time, to be a key contributor of our performance at the upfront this year. The other thing is that sports are going to continue to be in high demand. And so with the advertisers, we focused on the right deals that we've made over the past few years as well as our robust slate of original content shows and our studio shows and original content games. In terms of sort of the growing-the-pie idea, we believe that the value proposition of advertising with Disney+ is only enhanced with our addition of an ad-supported tier on Disney+. So we believe it's good for the consumer because it's going to give us another entry price point, but it's also going to be great for the advertisers. Our advertisers increasingly are looking for multiple platforms to reach a broader reach. And we think that as a company, we're going to provide that given our portfolio of streaming and our linear networks. So I think we're creating more avenues, both for consumer choice and for comprehensive advertising solutions, for our advertising customers at the same time.\nOperator: From Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo.\nSteven Cahall: Just 2. Maybe first, Bob, what's holding you back from making ESPN a fully a la carte sports network? Disney historically has always been more aggressive in the pivot to streaming than some of the peers. We've already seen some of the peers put a lot of their key sports like the NFL on to streaming. You talked a lot about how much the bundle is working with Disney+ and Hulu. So just really wondering how you're thinking about all the content you've got on ESPN+ and what it would take to make that fully a la carte and drive the DTC strategy even harder. And then Christina, I have asked this before, so I'm just going to try again. Of the $32 billion in content spend, any help in sizing maybe how much of that is either general entertainment or local content?\nBob Chapek : Okay. So as you know, on all of our Linear Networks, they're huge cash generators for us. So to some extent, we're doing a really good job of chopping down some of the debt that we've had to accumulate due to either acquisition or through the COVID challenge. And so the hesitancy to move too fast away from those is really a cash flow situation that I think puts our company in a healthier overall situation. At the same time, we're very conscious of our ability to go more aggressively into the DTC area of ESPN. And so what we're doing is sort of putting one foot on the dock, if you will, and one foot on the boat right now. But we know that at some point when it's going to be good for our shareholders, we'll be able to fully go into an ESPN DTC offering the way that you described. And we fully believe that there is a business model there for us that's going to enable us to regain growth on ESPN+ in a full DTC expression. But at that point, obviously, that will have ramifications on immediate cash flow that we get from our legacy Linear Networks.\nChristine McCarthy : Okay. Steve, to answer your question on that $32 billion of content spend and where it's going, remember back when we talked about that initially, we talked about it being about 1/3 in sports. That still remains. And when you think about the balance of that $32 billion, a meaningful amount of it will be enterprise-wide content budget that will be dedicated into investments into the general entertainment content that we can leverage across all of our various distribution platforms. When we say that, we mean linear, theatrical as well as direct-to-consumer. And as I mentioned earlier, our world-class creative teams are focused on creating content that will drive subscriber growth in targeted segments and deeper engagement across the platform. This includes leveraging our existing intellectual property. Also, we're intent on creating new franchises. You saw that in Encanto and investing in general entertainment, local language content and sports rights. I just want to -- even though you didn't ask about local language content. I do want to give you some perspective because we haven't provided this previously. But as Bob mentioned, we have about 500 shows in the pipeline for local content outside of the U.S. or English speaking. When you look at that 500, I'll give you some broad breakdowns. In the Asia Pacific region, including Southeast Asia, of that 500, 140 is in that region; in EMEA, it's 150; in India, it's 100; and in Latin America, it's 200. So we haven't given that before, but I think that also kind of breaks it up in the various regions that we are in outside of the U.S.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, next question?\nOperator: Next question is from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays.\nKannan Venkateshwar : A couple, if I could. So Bob, first, I guess, when we think about the streaming goal, if we are really looking at 240 million subs at the midpoint, with the new ad-supported streaming service, what proportion of the base do you expect will be on that tier versus normal premium tier, especially given the fact that now you may have to do more than 50 million subs a year to get to that goal given the trend lines for this year? So that would be the first one. And secondly, I don't think Disney has been able to release a movie in China since 2019. If you could just help us understand what the roadblocks there are and when we could see some change in that process?\nBob Chapek : Okay. I'm going to start with China. And the situation there has been very fluid, and as you probably guess, very complicated both from a business standpoint and from a political standpoint. But as you know, we've got a long record of success and a strong fan base for our brands and franchises in this market. And our most recent releases were Death on the Nile and Encanto. And we'll continue to submit our films for release. And it's worth noting, I think, though, that at the time that we're having some difficulty in getting our films in China that Doctor Strange did extraordinary. We've just crossed $500 million in less than a week without this market. So we're pretty confident that even without China, if it were to be that we continue to have difficulties in getting titles in there, that it doesn't really preclude our success given the relatively lower take rate that we get on the box office in China than we do across the rest of the world. Christine, do you want to talk about streaming?\nChristine McCarthy : Sure. On streaming, right now, we have not disclosed a mix or expected mix of an ad-supported tier. So we don't have any additional details on that product, and that includes pricing as well. But when we expand Disney+ across multiple price points with this new Disney+ ad tier, we are able to reach an even broader audience, and we'll create more avenues for consumer choice. And this is a consistent theme that you've heard from us, having the consumer be our North Star. We'll continue to evaluate what makes sense for the service, our brand and our core principle of providing consumers with the maximum flexibility and choice. So we expect the advertising revenue we earn will contribute positively to our ARPU as we look to achieve our long-term profitability goals.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator next question?\nOperator: Question is from Philip Cusick with JPMorgan.\nPhilip Cusick : A couple of follow-ups, if I can. On parks, can you talk about where the parks are -- the U.S. parks are in terms of staffing at parks as well as the potential for upside or not in those domestic attendance numbers for customers? And then, Bob, if I can go back to your comment on ESPN going all online someday, I think most of us expect us to happen eventually. Clearly, that will be a huge change in the P&L at both DTC and linear. When that happens, does the overall profitability of the company take a hit for a year or 2? And how does the long-term sports on ESPN+ model work? And what's the structure of that versus what we've seen in the past of a purely linear model?\nAlexia Quadrani : Christine, do you want to start with the first question? And then Bob second.\nChristine McCarthy : Sure. On our parks business, we're obviously extremely pleased with our domestic parks operations and how they have come back robustly. But on domestic attendance, we are -- we could, but we're choosing to limit attendance using our reservation system. And once again, that goes back to us trying to balance demand and attendance throughout the year, not have days when consumers in the parks aren't enjoying the experience. So attendance is something that we're controlling, but we're doing it to have a better consumer experience. And some of the things that we've brought back, we will continue to with additional capacity. But some capacity that we just brought back in April were things like the character meet-and-greets at our domestic parks. And we also brought back in April our Nighttime Spectaculars at the Disneyland Resort. And we'll also be opening a new attraction at Walt Disney World Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind at the end of this month on Memorial Day weekend, and that is all new capacity, and we're really looking forward to having our guests experience that.\nBob Chapek : Okay. And on the ESPN question, we're not ready to share the specifics of our model in terms of how long it would take for us to reach profitability on that or the impact that it would have on our linear business. But I would emphasize that we're only going to do it if it's accretive to our shareholder value when it comes time to actually pull the trigger. But I can tell you that it will be the ultimate fan offering that will appeal to super fans that really love sports. And I think there's nobody but ESPN that, frankly, could actually pull that off. But we don't have a lot of specifics when it comes to structure. But we do believe that because sports is so powerful, in fact, in the last quarter, 46 of the top 50 most viewed programs on linear TV were sports. And obviously, ESPN dominates that. And I do believe that sports is the third leg of our domestic offerings in terms of our DTC offerings. And right now, that expression is through the bundle. And I think that could become very powerful for us going forward in the future.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator next question please?\nOperator: From Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse.\nDouglas Mitchelson : So I guess 2 questions, if I could. Bob, you've continued to suggest a lot of confidence in Disney+ guidance. Can you talk about trends for churn and engagement for Disney+? And I'm not sure if you're willing to share how much of Disney+ viewing is new content versus library, just thinking as more and more new content starts to show up and ramp. And then separately, and maybe this is for Christine, Alexia, you'll let me know. But I'm just curious what you think the international fee park margin potential as it peaked at 16% in fiscal '19. I think we're getting a pretty good idea that the domestic theme parks is going to be very, very profitable. But international is still a bit of a mystery. I know you've got some parks closed and there's some disruption, but you also have a good idea of what you're seeing in the U.S., how you could apply that overseas and what you've done with the cost structure during the pandemic. And also, if you look back at fiscal '19, sorry for making the question a little bit longer, but Hong Kong was shut down for part of the year; china was, what, in year 3. So I'm just curious if those international margins, do we think about them getting closer and closer to U.S. margins over time?\nAlexia Quadrani : Bob, why don't you take the first half? And then Christine can follow up on parks.\nBob Chapek : Okay. In terms of our confidence in Disney+ guidance, as you probably know, we have a tremendous amount of data that we get on our DCC platforms, things like the first view, what's the first view that somebody watches when they first come on to our platform, which is a pretty good proxy for maybe why they signed up. There's also the amount of time spent, the engagement scores and then, of course, the churn information that you sort of look at. And we've said this before in past earnings calls, but we're extraordinarily pleased with the low churn that we see, particularly given the bundle. The bundle is really efficient in terms of churn. And that gives us a lot of bullishness when it comes to the idea of bigger offerings from Disney. So as we sort of take each of these elements, when we get a new piece of content, we'll look at first view, we'll look at engagement, we'll look at the amount of time they spend on it. And we can model. We can do a lot of modeling. And that modeling suggests that in addition to things like local market content, new content coming online, both in terms of general entertainment and from franchises as well as new markets being added, that, that Disney+ guidance is going to be very achievable for us both in terms of the sub adds and in terms of the operating performance.\nChristine McCarthy : Okay. On international theme parks, Doug. On Asia, I think it's really too early for us to tell. And as you heard in my comments, we said that we could see a negative impact of Hong Kong and Shanghai of $350 million in the next quarter, so just keep that in mind. But it is a bit of a tale of 2 cities. I can give you some very positive trends we're seeing out of Disneyland Paris. So just like domestically, we're seeing very strong yield growth at Disneyland Paris. And we're looking forward to its continued recovery, particularly with the recent launch of their 30th anniversary celebration. Avengers Campus, that's the first new themed area of our multiyear expansion that we've talked about previously for DLP, that will open this summer. And what has already opened is the -- one of our large hotels over there, the New York Hotel, has been re-themed in a Marvel theme and Avengers theme. So that's very exciting. And our guests love staying there. So I think it's -- what we're seeing in Paris gives me hope. Hope is not a strategy, but it gives me hope that our other parks in Asia will see that same rebound when their COVID-related headwinds abate.\nDouglas Mitchelson : If I could just follow up, maybe the simple way to put it is, you've talked about the potential for higher park margins than previous peak. Would that apply to both domestic parks, and separately, international parks longer term?\nChristine McCarthy : Well, Doug, we've said it for domestic. I -- we're not going to update that for international. There's just too much uncertainty with the region in Asia that has 2 of our parks right now.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator we have time for one more question.\nOperator: From Michael Morris with Guggenheim.\nMichael Morris : I have a couple on this advertising tier we're talking about for Disney+. My first is, can you share anything else on what remains to be done prior to the rollout, the implementation of that advertising tier? Are there assets you need to acquire? Or what are you building or anything like that given the pieces that you do already have in place through your ownership of Hulu, et cetera? So I'm curious about the advertising infrastructure. And then the second, you touched on this a little bit, Christine, but I'm curious if you can share any more relative sizing of the ARPU potential of the ad-supported service. Given that Disney+ is still half the price of Netflix domestically, I'm curious if ad-supported ARPU could actually be higher than where you are right now and if this does present a catalyst for you to raise price on the ad-free service?\nAlexia Quadrani : Bob, why don't you start and then Christine can finish.\nBob Chapek : Okay. We're in really good shape in terms of being able to meet our timing with our Disney+ ad tier. And that's largely because we're already doing it. The combination of our ESPN+, streaming tech stack and our experience in Hulu and the software, we think that our current advertising capabilities really substantially prepare us to already bring this tier into operations. So there's nothing that we need to go acquire or, frankly, even in any significant way developing anything new. And that's due to the ongoing investments in technology that we've made over time to increasingly automate much of this process. And we've been looking forward to this for a while. So this is something that's well-greased, if you will. And our teams are hard at work at making that become a reality.\nChristine McCarthy : So on the incremental information you would like on our ad-supported tier, at this time, we haven't announced a price point for it. So we're not going to do that today. But we will continue to evaluate what makes sense for the service in terms of pricing. And I will say that you can look to our experience with Hulu and their ad-supported tier. We believe that this will contribute to ARPU. And we look at it as certainly something additive that will work towards achieving our long-term profitability goals.\nAlexia Quadrani : Okay.

Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is also being webcast and we'll post a transcript of this call to our website. Joining me today are Bob Chapek, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we'll be happy to take some of your questions.  So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nBob Chapek: Thanks, Jenn, and good afternoon, everyone. As we begin the final year of The Walt Disney Company's first century, I am pleased to share our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, starting with the highlights. Our adjusted EPS of $1.06 is up from $0.32 a year ago. Our Domestic Parks and Resorts achieved all-time revenue and operating income records despite the Omicron surge. And our streaming services ended Q1 with 196.4 million total subscriptions after adding 70.4 million in the quarter, including 11.8 million Disney+ subscribers. I'll share more about those items shortly. But first, I want to talk about this unique moment in the history of The Walt Disney Company. It is perhaps fitting that our 100th anniversary comes at a time of significant change for us and our industry. In the midst of a global pandemic, fast-changing consumer expectations and a leadership transition, we reimagined our Parks business, substantially increased our investment in content creation and executed a reorganization that will facilitate our ongoing transformation. Each of those actions has helped set the stage for our second century, and as we approach that remarkable milestone, I am filled with optimism. We have the world's most creative storytelling engine, an unmatched collection of brands and franchises and an ability to tell stories that form deep emotional connections with audiences. We have a portfolio of distribution platforms, including powerful and growing streaming services. We have diverse revenue streams that span business models and industries, but which all are interconnected to create entertainment's most powerful synergy machine. We have the country's top news organization and the most trusted brand for following sports and our theme parks continue to be the most magical places on earth. In short, our collection of assets and platforms, creative capabilities in unique place and the cultural zeitgeist give me great confidence that we will continue to define entertainment for the next 100 years. To carry through on that promise, we will be guided by three strategic pillars: storytelling excellence, innovation and audience focus. Storytelling excellence is, of course, dependent on having excellent storytellers. I am thrilled to share that our legacy of being home to the most accomplished leaders in the industry will continue, as nearly all of our top creative executives have recently renewed, extended or signed new contracts. I could not be more excited to continue working with these creative powerhouses. The quality content from our teams was recognized just yesterday with a fantastic 23 Oscar nominations, including three of the five best animated feature films: Pixar's Luca; Walt Disney Animation's Raya and the Last Dragon; and our newest franchise, Walt Disney Animation's Encanto, which received three nominations. Summer of Soul was recognized in the best documentary category, and Nightmare Alley and West Side Story both received best picture nominations. As you may have seen earlier today, we announced West Side Story will debut in most Disney+ markets on March 2 and we can't wait for our subscribers to see this incredible film. In Q1, our studios took us deeper into the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Eternals and the Disney+ original series, Hawkeye. And returned us to that galaxy far, far away with another Disney+ original series of Book of Boba Fett. Our general entertainment teams also continued to produce programming of the highest quality. In fact, last year, our general entertainment team produced nearly 1/4 of the industry's best review shows. And Q1 saw 10 of their shows achieved a 100% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes. That includes Abbott Elementary, the first Freshman Broadcast comedy to earn the 100% certified fresh score since ABC's own Modern Family in 2009. Our success in branded storytelling is, of course, no secret. However, it's often lost that the depth, breadth and quality of our general entertainment content is also a driving force behind the success of our streaming services. In fact, 6 of the 10 most watched programs across our services are general entertainment titles produced by our own team. And general entertainment is an increasingly powerful driver of engagement in most of our international markets where such content is already included in our service under the Star brand. Going forward, integrating more owned general entertainment into our services, especially Disney+, will be a priority. In fact, just today, we added episodes of Grown-ish, Blackish and the Wonder Years to our domestic Disney+ service. Rounding out our content focuses, is of course, sports.  Sporting events continue to be the most powerful draw in television accounting for 95 of the 100 most watched live broadcast in 2021, and ESPN once again set the bar this quarter with live games across each of our four major U.S. sports, including the revolutionary Monday Night with Peyton and Eli. And I am pleased to announce that we have expanded our agreement with Peyton Manning and its Omaha Productions Company to extend our relationship through the 2024 NFL season, and we'll add alternative presentations for UFC golf and college football events for each of the next three years. While multiplatform television and streaming will continue to be the foundation of sports coverage for the immediate future, we believe the opportunity for The Walt Disney Company goes well beyond these channels. It extends to sports betting, gaming and the metaverse. In fact, that's what excites us, the opportunity to build a sports machine akin to our franchise flywheel that enables audiences to experience, connect with and become actively engaged with our favorite sporting events, stories, teams and players. Turning to distribution results. The continued growth of our streaming services was certainly a standout. Our success at Disney+ this quarter was not the result of any one item, but instead a combination of organic growth and powerful new content, our strategic decision to include the Disney bundle with all Hulu Live subscriptions and new market launches. The remainder of this fiscal year will feature compelling Disney+ originals from across our brands and franchises, beginning with Pixar's Turning Red and Marvel Studios Moon Night in March. And the back half of FY '22 will feature a truly stunning array of content, including two Star Wars series: Andor, and the highly anticipated Obi-Wan Kenobi, which I am excited to announce will premiere on May 25. We'll debut two Marvel series, Ms. Marvel and She-Hulk; fresh new shorts from Disney Animation and Pixar, featuring the worlds of Big Hero 6 and Cars; a live-action reimagining of the Disney Classic Pinocchio, starring Tom Hanks as Geppetto; and one of the most anticipated sequels in some time, especially in the Chapek household, Hocus Pocus 2. As I've said before, we continue to manage our services for the long term and maintain confidence in our guidance of 230 million to 260 million total paid Disney+ subscribers globally by the end of fiscal 2024. Christine will provide more detail into our theatrical results. However, I want to reiterate that we continue to see value in the moviegoing experience, especially for big franchise blockbusters. And given the performance of titles like Spider-Man: No Way Home, we are looking forward to kicking off our summer slate with another Marvel franchise film, Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. That said, audiences will be our North Star as we determine how our content is distributed. And we do not subscribe to the belief that theatrical distribution is the only way to build a Disney franchise. This quarter, audience has proved us right, as Encanto became a phenomenon within days of its arrival on Disney+ after families continued reluctance to return to theaters resulted in a muted theatrical performance. With outstanding music from Lin-Manuel Miranda, it became the fastest titled across 200 million hours viewed on Disney+ and took social media by storm. People around the world expressed their fandom through their own content and conversation and the Encanto hashtag has been viewed more than 11 billion times. The sound track, which debuted at #197 on the Billboard 200 Chart reached #1 shortly after debuting on Disney+ and 8 of the film songs hit the Hot 100 Chart, including We Don't Talk About Bruno, which became the first Disney song to reach #1 since Aladdin\u2019s Whole New World in 1993. At the same time, sales of Encanto merchandise defied traditional post-holiday declines and actually increased following the film's release on Disney+ on Christmas Eve and guests at Disney California Adventure have loved seeing Mirabel in real life. These results are exactly what you would expect from the launch of a new Disney franchise and we are thrilled that Disney+ was the catalyst. We are more confident than ever in this platform as a content service, a franchise engine and as a venue for the next generation of Disney storytelling. Finally, I could not be more pleased with the performance of our Parks, Experiences and Products segment, which posted its second best quarter of all time. Over the last several years, we've transformed the guest experience by investing in new storytelling and ground-breaking technology and the records at our domestic parks are the direct result of this investment. From new franchise-based lands and attractions to craveable food and beverage offerings, the must-have character merchandise, there is more great Disney storytelling infused into every aspect of a visit to our parks than ever before. At the same time, we're giving guests new tools to personalize their visits and spend less time in line and more time having fun. While we anticipated these products would be popular, we have been blown away by the reception. In the quarter, more than 1/3 of domestic park guests purchased either Genie+, Lightning Lane or both. That number rose to more than 50% during the holiday period. While demand was strong throughout the quarter at both domestic sites, our reservation system enabled us to strategically manage attendance. In fact, their stellar performance was achieved at lower attendance levels than 2019. As we return to a more normalized environment, we look forward to more fully capitalizing on the extraordinary demand for our parks along with the already realized yield benefits that took shape this quarter. And we, of course, will continue to invest in the guest experience. I am personally looking forward to Star Wars: Galactic Star Cruiser at Walt Disney World, a 2-night adventure into the most immersive Star Wars story ever created. We are pleased with demand for this premium ground-breaking experience, which will welcome guests starting on March 1. Later this summer, we will debut an innovative new rollercoaster at EPCOT, Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind and Open Avengers Campus at Disneyland Paris, where the iconic Quinjet landed a few weeks ago ahead of the resort's 30th anniversary celebrations. I want to close by thanking our 195,000 employees for bringing Disney magic to audiences and guests around the world, especially in times like these, when the world needs it most. Our company is truly extraordinary, and I am honored to work with the most talented team in the industry to create the next generation of Disney stories and experiences through our focus on storytelling excellence, innovation and our audience. With that, I'll hand it over to Christine.\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.06, an increase of $0.74 from the prior year quarter. Fiscal 2022 is off to a good start as evidenced by our first quarter results and our continued progress towards more normalized operations across our businesses. At Parks, Experiences and Products, operating income was up $2.6 billion year-over-year as all of our parks and resorts around the world were open for the entirety of the fiscal first quarter. In the prior year quarter, Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were open for the entire quarter, while Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Disneyland Paris were each open for a limited number of weeks and Disneyland Resort was closed for the entire quarter. At our domestic parks, we were very pleased with the strong levels of demand we saw from both Walt Disney World and Disneyland. And as Bob mentioned, our reservation system has allowed us to strategically manage attendance. Overall, attendance trends at our domestic parks continued to strengthen in the quarter with Walt Disney World and Disneyland\u2019s Q1 attendance up double digits versus Q4, in part reflecting holiday seasonality. Per capita spending at our domestic parks was up more than 40% versus fiscal first quarter 2019 driven by a more favorable guest and ticket mix, higher food, beverage and merchandise spending and contributions from Genie+ and Lightning Light. Putting these factors together, our domestic Parks and Resorts delivered Q1 revenue and operating income exceeding pre-pandemic levels, even as we continue managing attendance to responsibly address ongoing COVID considerations. Looking ahead to Q2, our demand pipeline for domestic guests at Walt Disney World and Disneyland remained strong, benefiting from our 50th anniversary celebration at Walt Disney World and new attractions and experiences at both parks. At International Parks, a profitable first quarter reflected improving trends at Disneyland Paris. We also saw improved results at Hong Kong Disneyland although the resort is now temporarily closed in response to a resurgence in COVID cases in the region. We expect International Parks will continue to be impacted by COVID-related volatility for the remainder of Q2. Moving on to our Media and Entertainment Distribution segment. First quarter operating income decreased by more than $600 million versus the prior year as revenue growth across our lines of business was more than offset by higher programming and production costs. Revenue growth in the quarter was primarily driven by increased subscription fees from our direct-to-consumer services. We also delivered record advertising revenues for the segment as we continue to see strong advertiser demand for our live sports and streaming and digital businesses. Turning to our results by line of business. At Linear Networks, you may recall that we guided to a decrease in operating income of nearly $500 million for Q1 versus the prior year. Operating income of $1.5 billion came in better than expected, primarily driven by our international channels, which I'll discuss in a minute. At our domestic channels, both Broadcasting and Cable operating income decreased in the first quarter versus the prior year. Lower results at Broadcasting were impacted by an adverse comparison to prior year political advertising revenue at our owned television stations, as we noted in the guidance we gave last quarter. At Cable, the year-over-year decrease in operating income reflected higher programming and production costs and increased marketing spend, partially offset by increases in advertising and affiliate revenue. Growth in advertising revenue was driven by ESPN as we benefited from the start of a normalized NBA calendar and increased viewership for football. ESPN advertising revenue in the first quarter was up 14% versus the prior year and second quarter-to-date domestic cash advertising sales at ESPN are currently pacing up. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased by 2% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by 6 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. Operating income at our international channels decreased slightly versus the prior year. These results came in more than $200 million better than our prior guidance primarily due to lower programming and production costs as well as better-than-expected advertising and affiliate revenues. At Direct-to-Consumer, first quarter operating results decreased by $127 million year-over-year, driven by higher losses at Disney+ and ESPN+ partially offset by improved results at Hulu. I'll note that beginning this quarter, we are providing disclosure on our programming and production expenses by service as well as additional detail for Disney+ in our 10-Q. Operating losses at Disney+ increased versus the prior year as growth in subscription revenue was more than offset by higher programming, technology and marketing costs. We ended the quarter with nearly 130 million global paid Disney+ subscribers, reflecting over 11 million net additions from Q4. Taking a look at subscriber growth by region. We added 4.1 million paid domestic Disney+ subscribers, including a benefit of approximately 2 million incremental subscribers from our strategic decision to include Disney+ and ESPN+ as part of a Hulu Live subscription. In international markets, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, we added 5.1 million paid subscribers, primarily driven by growth in Asia Pacific and European markets. I'll note that growth in Asia included the benefit of new market launches in South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong in the quarter. Finally, we were able to resume growth in Disney+ Hotstar markets with 2.6 million paid subscriber additions in the quarter. Overall, we are pleased with Disney+ subscriber growth in the quarter and are looking forward to new market launches and a strong content slate later this year. As I've previously shared, we don't anticipate that subscriber growth will necessarily be linear from quarter-to-quarter, and we continue to expect growth in the back half of the fiscal year to exceed growth in the first half. At ESPN+, we ended the first quarter with over 21 million paid subscribers versus 17 million in Q4. Results decreased compared to the prior year as growth in subscription revenue was more than offset by higher sports programming costs driven by the NHL and LaLiga. And at Hulu, higher subscription revenues versus the prior year were partially offset by higher programming and production costs driven by increased affiliate fees for live TV. Hulu ended the first quarter with 45.3 million paid subscribers, inclusive of 4.3 million subscribers to our Hulu Live digital MVPD service. Moving on to content sales, licensing and other. Results decreased in the first quarter versus the prior year to an operating loss of $98 million, driven by lower theatrical results and higher film impairments, partially offset by improved TV/SVOD results. As I noted last quarter, while theatres have generally reopened, we are still experiencing a prolonged recovery to the theatrical exhibition, particularly for certain genres of films, including non-branded general entertainment and family-focused animation. This dynamic contributed to increased losses in the quarter as we released more titles in Q1 this year versus the prior year, resulting in lower theatrical results. This was partially offset by income from our coproduction of Spider-Man: No Way Home. As we look ahead, we would like to give you some context around 2 items that may impact our second quarter results. First, as we continue to increase our investment in content, we expect programming and production costs at DMED to increase versus the prior year, primarily driven by Direct-to-Consumer and Linear Networks. At Direct-to-Consumer, we expect programming and production expenses to increase by approximately $800 million to $1 billion, including programming fees for Hulu Live. At Linear Networks, we expect programming and production expenses to increase by approximately $500 million, reflecting factors including COVID-related timing shifts. We aired 4 additional NFL games at the start of the current quarter. And as a reminder, the Academy Awards will be held in Q2 of this year, while they fell into Q3 of the prior year. Second, at content sales, licensing and other, a difficult Q2 comparison to prior year TV and SVOD program sales is due in part to our strategic decision to hold more of our owned and produced content for our direct-to-consumer services. As a result, we expect operating income to be adversely impacted by more than $200 million versus the prior year quarter. With that, I'll turn it back to Jenn, and we would be happy to take your questions.\nJenn Kettnich : Thanks, Christine. As we transition to the Q&A, let me note that since we are not physically together this afternoon, I will do my best to moderate the Q&A by directing your questions to the appropriate executive. [Operator Instructions]  And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Our first question comes from Ben Swinburn with Morgan Stanley.\nBenSwinburne: Thanks. Good afternoon, and thank you for the additional disclosure. Bob, I wanted to ask you about Disney+. The U.S. subscriber base or the, I guess, the U.S. and Canadian subscriber base is larger than we would have thought. You guys have gotten to, I think, almost -- probably more than 1/3 penetrated of total broadband homes. And it's, I guess, interesting to me because it's a narrower service than the international product, which has the Star tile. So I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you see the runway still ahead in North America for that product. And then when you look at the international business, so leaving Hotstar aside, what does your research tell you about what the company needs to do to drive that business meaningfully higher? Because it deliver on your '24 guidance, that's really probably the biggest key is to get that sub base going. So I'm just curious, as you look at the plan, what are the things you think really can make that happen? Thank you.\nBob Chapek: Thanks, Ben. So on the Disney+ U.S. side, you mentioned that we're roughly 1/3 penetrated. We still have some headroom in each one of our major franchises in terms of those viewers, those fans that have expressed interest in subscribing. So we are not nearly tapped out on each of the major franchises if someone identifies as a Lucas fan, Star Wars or as a Marvel fan or as a Disney fan. The biggest opportunity in terms of significance is with general entertainment being added to the service.  And I think you've seen just this quarter, we mentioned that today that we're adding in Grown-ish, Black-ish and a few other titles into our service. I think that will be a trend of us taking more general entertainment and moving it over to Disney+ because, as you know, about 50% -- slightly over 50% of our consumer base on Disney+ do not have kids. It's a very broad general service, of course, driven by the Disney brand and driven by families, but what we've seen time and time again is that the elasticity of Disney and its brand is much greater than we might have given it credit. And I think nowhere does this play out more, now getting into the international side of your question, than we see in Europe with the Star brand tile being the sixth brand tile within the Disney+ offering in Europe.  The other thing, though, to your question directly on international that's going to drive the international business is the predominance of local content that we are developing in order to appeal to the unique taste of each of those international markets. And I'll point out to the 340 productions that we referenced on the last call that we're developing. And by the way, we just created a new organization within our company to shepherd the development of that content, so that we can maximize the chance that we get some global hits, if you will, out of some of that local content. And so we're bullish on the future of Disney+, both domestically and internationally, driven by not only additional prevalence of titles within our major franchises, but also general entertainment and specifically in the international territories local content.\nBen Swinburne: That's super helpful, Bob. And just curious, as a follow-up, of those 300 productions or the local originals, will we see a lot of that in fiscal '22 come on the service?\nBob Chapek: Yes. That's the slate that comes on, I think, over the next 1.5 years, next 1.5 years to 2 years. So I don't exactly know the percent that will fall within the context of this year. But we started this initiative about a year ago, and I must say it's actually extraordinary how great the content is that's being developed in the international territories.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you.\nJenn Kettnich: Thanks, Ben, for the question. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.\nMichael Nathanson: Hey, thanks Bob. Going on that same part about international Disney+. Can you talk about what role the sports play, maybe even outside of India? So what are you seeing in Latin America? Does that help close the gap? And in general, how do you consider maybe loss leading with sports versus pulling back on sports and investing in more of your own content? Thanks.\nBob Chapek: The sports proposition internationally really varies by market. As you know, in Europe, it's not a big component for us, but in Latin America, it actually is. And our -- the way that we've gone to market in each territory, one of the differences between how we go to market in Asia versus how we go to market in Latin America versus how we go to market in Europe is a function of sports. That's a really big piece of it. And where you see like in Latin America where we've got a very big percentage of our consumers that are subscribing to our services because of sports, it's a bigger component to that. Sports for us are -- it's a very important strategic offering because the fandom and the passion is so deep. If you look at India, we're certainly going to try to extend our rights on the IPL. But we're very confident that even if we were not to go ahead and win that auction that we would still be able to achieve our 230 to 260. So it's an important component for us around the world. Obviously really important in India, but not critical to us achieving the 230 to 260 number that we've guided to.\nMichael Nathanson: Thank you.\nJenn Kettnich: Thanks, Michael. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. So Bob, if I could just follow-up on that comment on IPL. Hotstar was about 40% of your long-term guide and without cricket, getting to that number seems like a little bit tougher to do, just given the popularity of the sport in the country and also the fact that Hotstar has been in the country for a long time as a localized service. So just wanted to see what bridges that gap to your guidance if -- in the scenario that you don't end up getting Hotstar? And then beyond that, maybe -- sorry, go ahead, Bob.\nBob Chapek: No, no, go ahead, please.\nKannan Venkateshwar: So Christine, from a guidance perspective, I guess the other variable is just a breakeven guidance in 2024 for the streaming service. And you did talk about content spend being at least $8 billion to $9 billion in that year last quarter. So just given the growth in entertainment content locally around the world as well as some of the investments in sports in Latin America and potentially an increase in cost in India, could you just frame what kind of upside we could see to that content spend budget? Any framework in terms of how to think about it would be useful? Thanks.\nJenn Kettnich: Bob, do you want to start off on the IPL and Christine can chime in with some more detail on that and the breakeven guidance in content spend?\nBob Chapek: Sure, sure. So while the IPL obviously, is an important part of the Disney+ Hotstar content offering, it's really one component of a broader portfolio of entertainment and sports. In addition to, obviously, the original content and the library content from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and Nat Geo, our Disney+ Hotstar offering does have a massive collection of local content, and we add over 18,000 hours of original programming every year. So while certainly it's an important component, that local content that we're developing really will mitigate the impact of us if we were not to win the auction on IPL. So an important component, but it's not like we see that business evaporating if we don't get it. Christine?\nChristine McCarthy: Okay. Kannan, on your question on the breakeven guidance and on Disney+ content spend. We're not updating the guidance. We have that fiscal '24 guidance out in the marketplace, and we're sticking to it. We're not yet at a steady state of content expense for Disney+, but we expect to have made significant progress by fiscal 2023.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jessica Reif Erlich with Bank of America Securities.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Maybe switching gears to Theme Parks. The leverage in that business is ginormous as we've seen in this quarter. Would you consider the 34% operating income margin peak margin? And then just maybe some color because international visitors really haven't come back, we know they stay longer and spend more. Have you gotten all of the technology improvements that you expect? And within that, with some of the changes that you made in the park, it sounds like you're actually improving capacity. So how should we think about capacity now versus what it was prior to COVID?\nBob Chapek: Christine, do you want that one on the margins?\nChristine McCarthy: Sure. I would say we've been saying this all along through the pandemic, where we have taken measures to really look at the cost base and how we're doing things. And there's been a fundamental shift in some of the operational processes that the parks had used for many, many years and things like the ability to do mobile dining or not having to check in with the human being at a hotel, those kinds of things are all things that add to upside that we have at the parks. And as you mentioned, Jessica, we haven't yet seen the return of our international guests. And remember, historically, and we always hit this historical boundary of our band of 18% to 22% of our Walt Disney World guests came from outside of the U.S., and they haven\u2019t even yet started to return.  So I think there's a lot of things that are boding well, and we saw the performance this quarter of Genie and at the other things like Lightning Lane, but it's not just that. It's also really compelling offerings in food, beverage, merchandise. And it's really great to see not only creativity in our content business, but creativity at our parks as well. And that's driving some of that incremental spending that's certainly helping the margins get to that level that we've seen this quarter.\nJenn Kettnich: All right. Thanks for the question, Jessica.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman : I believe we're going to be coming up on an anniversary of the first price change that you had for the Disney+ service. And so I was hoping you could give us some insight in terms of how you're thinking about pricing strategy for the product going forward? And what are the key things that influence that in terms of timing, when you bring new content on, distribution partners or anything else we should be thinking about as we model out ARPU?\nBob Chapek: Christine, I'll start with this. And if you want to augment, please do. We maintain that we offer an extraordinary price value relationship around the world for Disney+. Obviously, the last few years, pretty much the entirety of the launch of Disney+ have been plagued by COVID-related production interruptions. Plus in all fairness, our own recognition that we needed to essentially double our production output. You put those 2 things together, and we certainly have less content than we want. But as we've said over the last few earnings calls, that will rectify itself in the second half of this year, we've already reached 1 of our 2 goals. One of the goals was to go ahead and ensure that we had a new title every week, and we've achieved that. But by '23, we want to get to a steady state, which is even higher than we have right now. And I think that will give us the impetus to increase that price value relationship even higher and then have the flexibility if we were to so choose to then look at price increases on our service. But it's all about content, content, content and we are bullish about our future content going forward, not only in terms of quality, but also in terms of quantity. And that's really what's driving our bullishness for what we might see as the pricing power that we would have going forward.\nChristine McCarthy: Brett. The only other thing I would add to that is that we are still only less than 2.5 years into this business, and we're learning a lot about what consumers are watching, consumption patterns, repeatability and all of those things will factor into when we look at the -- as Bob mentioned, the price value equation going forward. So as we learn more, we'll continue to refine the business model.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse.\nDougMitchelson: I'd echo Ben's appreciation of the extra streaming details. I guess a couple of questions. Latin America was not mentioned. And I know on the last conference call, there was a discussion of working with distributors on Star post launch to improve traction there. Is there any story as to why there was pretty good success here in Europe and Asia Pac, but a little bit less so in Latin America?  And then probably for Christine, but on the Direct-to-Consumer programming cost increase that you highlighted for fiscal 2Q, I'm not sure if there's more context there, but also can we think about the next couple of quarters thereafter to be something in a similar range? Certainly, the fourth quarter was already highlighted as a quarter where we're going to see a lot of fresh original programming. Anything that could sort of help us shape out the year on that regard would be helpful.\nJenn Kettnich: Thanks, Doug, for the question. Bob, do you want to start off on LatAm or international subs and then Christine, you can add to that.\nBob Chapek: Yes, I will. I'll talk about LatAm because it kind of goes back a little bit to this live sports story that was questioned earlier. We're actually encouraged by what we see in LatAm, especially given the straight of that Live Sports calendar and a growing pipeline of local original productions. I mean, the reason why we're doing so many local productions because we know what their power is in those localized markets. And we're also encouraged that we're seeing a dynamic that we also see in the U.S., which is the vast majority of the sign-ups that came this quarter came from the Combo Plus. In other words, it's the bundle. And so we're starting to see LatAm sort of pick up some of the same characteristics that we see in domestic. When we started off in LatAm, just like we did with Disney+, it was a little bit slower, but they always seem to keep -- kind of a catch-up, if you will. And we believe in the strength of our local originals and those 2,000 live sporting events that we program each month. Our growing wholesale footprint, you talked about partnerships. That's an important part, particularly in Latin America, that wholesale footprint and new promotional offers that we are testing in the marketplace. So we think that the combination of those things plus our ability to migrate our customers from our linear channels to their digital channels really gives us reason to be fairly bullish in Latin America right now. And Christine.\nChristine McCarthy: Doug, the question on Disney+ programming. We expect to -- for the full year spend on content to be -- including sports rights to be as much as that $33 billion in total. The increase from year-over-year is more spending on our DTC expansion. And this also assumes there is no significant production delays and things could happen for things other than COVID as well. We had a couple of productions that did get delayed for other reasons. But when you think about -- your comment on our heavy slate of content coming to the service in the fourth quarter is true. But remember, the spending for that is before then. So you'll continue to see increased spending this year. And when you're looking at that $33 billion, I think it's also informative to take into account that about 1/3 of that is for sports rights, including the programming and production, but primarily it's the sports right. So if you want to think about the total $33 billion, take out 1/3 for sports and the remainder is for content. Not all on Disney+, some of that's for Hulu as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim.\nMichael Morris: I wanted to ask you one about Hulu and just follow up on the parks. On Hulu, the SVOD ARPU was down a bit year-over-year. You guys cited the lower per subscriber ad revenue. I'm hoping you could talk a little bit more about what's driving that. Is engagement down? Is pricing down? I know there's been some talk of some content that may be coming off the service. So if you could expand on that a bit, that would be helpful. And then second, I just want to follow up on the earlier question about capacity at the parks and whether that has expanded through the cycle. So I'm just trying to think about the runway given how strong the per caps have been and we can kind of do the math on how much attendance went down and how much you've reported, it's come back. But I'm curious if you can give us any more perspective on whether we can exceed or by how much we could exceed those prior attendance levels.\nJenn Kettnich: Bob, do you want to start off on parks then Christine can touch on Hulu SVOD ARPU?\nBob Chapek: Okay. I'll start off on parks. So the issue or the question of capacity at parks is a bit of a complex one because it's driven by several different dynamics. First of all, we've got really strong domestic demand, as we've said, mitigated a little bit by a lagged return from the international markets. Now that in itself is expected because the booking timetable is so long on international trips. So we believe that will come up and enable us to get closer to where we would have been in the past. But in terms of sort of the self-management capacity, one of the last things to come back for us in a post-COVID world -- what we hope is a post-COVID world, is actually live entertainment because much of the live entertainment is close proximity. And we are self-regulating that. We are self-managing that because we don't want our guests to feel an excessive level of density. And the place that you get it is parades and firework shows and things like that. So I suspect that over time, we'll start to regain some of the capacity drop-off that where it's kind of self-imposing on ourselves. The other thing I should say is that, to a certain extent, because people spend such a long time in our parks and resorts, the food and beverage component is actually a pretty big one of those. And if there's -- we really haven't had too big of an issue in terms of retaining and attracting people into our parks -- to work into our parks at all. As a matter of fact, we had 85% of our cast members pretty much say, yes, immediately, when we ask them back. But at the same time, the 2 areas that have been difficult is hospitality, and right now, we've got 90% of our hotels at Walt Disney World open and we've got all of our hotels at Disneyland open, but also sort of cooks, I think kind of short order cooks. And so the capacity constraints, the self-imposed capacity constraints are really a function of our food and beverage sort of mitigation, if you will. But the second one is live entertainment, and we're working towards restoring both of those so that we can get up to something that would be more similar to what we've seen in the past in terms of the number of people we put into our parks. But I must tell you that our ability to increase our guest experience through a very -- a reservation system in a very carefully managed demand ticketing system has been something that we really like. And I think guaranteeing our guests that they have a great experience no matter when they come, whether it be the Christmas holiday or whether it be in the middle of the month of September, that's really important to us. And so we're going to self-manage as to optimize the guest experience. But at the same time, we know we firmly got some headroom, whether it's due to international or whether it's due to an expansion and reinstatement of things like live entertainment.\nChristine McCarthy: Great. And Mike, your question on the Hulu SVOD ARPU. Let me just start with advertiser demand because I think this is an important concept. It's incredibly robust for advertising on Hulu. We're able to use our data. We offer targeted advertising. Some people call it addressable. We've built a unified ad platform across all of our businesses that do utilize advertising. So we're seeing that as being a growth business for us and are very, very pleased with it. On this particular question on the ARPU for Hulu. In the quarter, we benefited growth from some high-impact promotional offers during the quarter on Black Friday. There was one that went into the market. Those particular subscribers are showing high rates of engagement and the conversion of them from the promo to the full price, we're pretty optimistic of that given their engagement levels. So while it was down, you could view it as this was an offering to get people to sample the product. And the -- it seems like the product is being certainly appreciated. And we're hoping for those to once again convert to full paid subscribers\nOperator: This question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi.\nJason Bazinet: I just had one long-term question. You guys have done so well over the years in terms of running theme parks world-class and storytelling as you alluded to. The one area where I think Disney has sort of struggled a little bit has been with software development. And as you think about sports betting and the metaverse, it just seems like strategically, that's going to become potentially a more important piece of your core competency going forward. Is that sort of top of mind? Or do you think that's sort of not a correct way to think about sort of the muscles that you guys need to build over the next 5 years?\nJenn Kettnich: Jason, I think you're cutting in and out, but I think we got the gist of the question. Bob, do you want to take that one?\nBob Chapek: Yes, yes. I think I got the gist of it. It is top of mind. It is absolutely top of mind because we realize that in the future, you can call it what you want. You want to call it metaverse, you want to call it the blending of the physical and digital experiences, which I think Disney should excel at for all the reasons that you said in your opening. We realize that it's going to be less of a passive type experience where you just have playback whether it's a sporting event or whether it's an entertainment offering and more of an interactive lean forward, actively engaged type experience. And this is a very top of mind thing for us because we are continuing over time to augment our skills and the types of people that we attract into The Walt Disney Company to reflect the aggressive and ambitious technology agenda that we have. You probably noticed that one of my 3 pillars is innovation and specifically technological innovation because we realize that this is going to be an important part of telling story in that third dimension that lean forward Interactive dimension. So it is absolutely top of mind.\nJenn Kettnich: Okay. Thanks for the question, and we want to thank everyone for joining us today.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Alexia Quadrani, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani: Good afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to The Walt Disney Company's fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast and a replay and transcript, as well as the fourth quarter earnings presentation will all be made available on our website after the call. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Lansberry, Interim Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Kevin, we will be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nRobert Iger: Thanks, Alexia, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we begin, this week we announced that Hugh Johnston will be joining the Walt Disney Company as Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer after 34 years with PepsiCo. It's great to have Hugh joining Disney at this important moment for our company. I'd also like to thank Kevin Lansberry, who stepped into the CFO role on an interim basis earlier this year and has provided strong leadership in the month since. Kevin is returning to his role as CFO of our Disney Experiences segment and you'll hear more from him in just a bit. Now let's turn to the quarter. Our results this quarter speak volumes about the underlying strength of our company and the remarkable amount of work we have accomplished this past year. Q4 adjusted earnings per share nearly tripled over the prior year. And all three of our businesses, Entertainment, Experiences, and Sports saw significant increases in fourth quarter operating income compared to Q4 of fiscal 2022. The thorough restructuring of our company has enabled tremendous efficiencies and we're on track to achieve roughly $7.5 billion in cost reductions, which is approximately $2 billion more than we targeted earlier this year. Our new structure also enabled us to greatly enhance our effectiveness, particularly in streaming, where we've created a more unified, cohesive and highly coordinated approach to marketing, pricing and programing. This has helped us to improve operating results of our combined streaming businesses by approximately $1.4 billion from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023. And we remain confident that we will achieve profitability in Q4 of fiscal 2024. And most importantly, our new structure has restored creativity to the center of our company and we certainly know from our now 100 year history that nothing is more important or critical to our success. Indeed, our strong creative accomplishments helped drive impressive growth in core Disney+ subs with nearly 7 million added in the quarter. This reflects the success of numerous popular titles to hit the platform, including Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, The Little Mermaid and Elemental, continuing the trend of our theatrical releases being some of the most watched content on Disney+. Key originals also performed incredibly well across all our platforms, including Ahsoka on Disney+, The Kardashians, which is now our most viewed unscripted Hulu original series ever and the spectacular Korean original series, Moving, which has become a breakout hit. As I reflect on our achievement this past year, I'm mindful of the fact that a lot of time and effort was spent on fixing, both contending with certain decisions made in the recent past and addressing the numerous challenges brought on by disruption and the pandemic. And while we still have work to do to continue improving results, our progress has allowed us to move beyond this period of fixing and begin building our businesses again. As we look forward, we are focusing on four key building opportunities that will be central to our success. And they are: achieving significant and sustained profitability in our streaming business; building ESPN into the pre-eminent digital sports platform; improving the output and economics of our film studios; and turbocharging growth in our Experiences business. We have already made considerable progress on these four opportunities and we will continue to move forward with a sense of purpose and urgency. I've articulated many of my thoughts about our strategic initiative. So today, I want to discuss in more detail these four building opportunities as we enter this next phase. First, is turning streaming into a profitable growth business and I'm pleased to say our recent performance solidifies that we're on that path. In the four years since we launched Disney+, which generated roughly 10 million sign ups in the first 24 hours alone, core Disney+ subscribers have now reached over 112 million as of this end of fiscal 2023, including the nearly 7 million we gained this quarter. What's more, our ad-supported Disney+ product grew by approximately 2 million subscriptions in Q4 to a total of 5.2 million. In fact, more than 50% of Q4 new US subscribers chose an ad-supported Disney+ product. And over the past six months, these [indiscernible] subs spent 34% more time watching the service. We have the best advertiser technology in the streaming business globally and we have just introduced new tools that will make this an even more attractive platform for advertisers, much as we've done with Hulu. And speaking of Hulu, we were pleased to announce last week that we will acquire the remaining stake in Hulu held by Comcast, which will further Disney streaming objectives. We remain on track to rollout a more unified one-app experience domestically, making extensive general entertainment content available to bundle subscribers via Disney+. That includes critical and audience favorite like Hulu's Only Murders in the Building. The Bear, Abbott Elementary, as well as titles from our extensive content library built over decade, including adult animation stand-up like Family Guy and long-running hit series like 911, which is moving to ABC for Season 7. We expect that Hulu and Disney+ will result in increased engagement, greater advertising opportunities, lower churn and reduced customer acquisition costs, thereby increasing our overall margins. We will launch a beta version for bundle subscribers in December, giving parents time to set-up profiles and parental controls that work best for their families ahead of the official launch in early spring 2024. Also, we have additional opportunities for improvement in our streaming business that will come from implementing stronger standards around account sharing, although given the timing of our planned rollout, we don't expect a meaningful impact until 2025. Now that we have realigned our pricing and marketing strategies focused aggressively on getting the technology right, merged our creative and distribution teams and restored creative excellence is our singular motivating priority with the content we create, we are bullish about the future of our streaming business. And as you consider the components in the future of that business, just imagine the opportunities that are further combined Disney+, Hulu and ESPN streaming experience could offer us as a company and our consumers. Another core building opportunity is taking ESPN, which is already the world's leading sports brand and turning it into the pre-eminent digital sports platform, allowing us to reach fans in compelling new ways and fully integrating key features into our primary ESPN offering. We're already moving quickly down this path, and we are exploring strategic partnerships to help advance our efforts through marketing, technology, distribution and additional content. As we continue to develop our streaming business, the continued strength of ESPN relative to the backdrop of notable linear industry declines, demonstrates the value of sports and the power of the ESPN brand. Overall, our domestic ESPN business grew in revenue and operating income in both fiscal 2022 and in fiscal 2023. This fiscal year also saw the network deliver its best overall viewership in four years and its highest viewership in the key 18 to 49 demographic in the same time period. ESPN viewership was up in each of the four quarters as well, maintaining steady success throughout the entire year. Across ESPN networks, the company increased its already industry leading share of sports viewership in fiscal 2023 and we continue to see stability in ad sales, despite challenges facing the broader media industry. ESPN BET will launch next week through our agreement with Penn Entertainment and we're excited to bring sports fans this compelling new experience. Regarding our broader linear business. We continue to evaluate options for each of our linear networks with the goal of identifying the best strategic path for the company and maximizing shareholder value. However, our review of the business thus far has uncovered significant long-term cost opportunities which we are implementing, while continuing to deliver high quality content. Speaking of which, I'd like to acknowledge the world-class journalists and producers at ABC News. Over the past few months, many have risked their lives to keep our audiences informed during relentless news cycles and made ABC number one in network news for the 11th consecutive year. Next is the need to strengthen the creative output of our film studio, which generates value throughout the entire company. To achieve this, we are focusing heavily on the core brands and franchises that fuel all of our businesses, and reducing output overall to enable us to concentrate on fewer projects and improve quality, while continuing our effort around the creation of fresh and compelling original IP. I'm devoting considerably more of my time to this with the goal of improving returns, always seeking to exceed the level of creative excellence audiences expect from Disney. Meanwhile, we have four of the top 10 highest grossing films at the global box office this year, including Pixar's Elemental which has grossed nearly $0.5 billion worldwide in addition to being the most viewed film released this year on Disney+. We have more new releases still to come in calendar year 2023 including the Marvels from Marvel Studios, which will be released this Friday and Wish, our newest film from Walt Disney Animation Studios, which marks our company's 100th Anniversary and will be in theaters beginning November 22nd. We're also looking forward to our strong theatrical slate in 2024 with several films tied to popular franchises like Deadpool 3, featuring Wolverine, Kingdom of the Planet Apes and Inside Out 2. Additionally, Mufasa: The Lion King and sequels from our Toy Story, Frozen, Zootopia and Avatar franchises are all in the works. Finally, we have an opportunity to build Disney Experiences into an even bigger and more successful cash flow generation business. Parks and Experiences overall remains a growth story, and we are managing our portfolio exceptionally well. Even in the case of Walt Disney World, where we have a tough comparison to the prior year when you look at this year's numbers compared to pre-pandemic levels in fiscal 2019, we've seen growth in revenue and operating income of over 25% and 30%, respectively. Over the last five years, return on invested capital has nearly doubled in our domestic parks, and we have seen sizable increases over that same timeframe across the total Experiences portfolio as well. Not to mention the improved guest experience ratings we're now seeing at every one of our parks. As we announced in September, we plan to turbocharge growth in our Experiences business through strategic investments over the next decade. Given our wealth of IP, innovative technology, buildable land, unmatched creativity, and strong returns on invested capital, we're confident about the potential from our new investments. Looking at the company as a whole, today, we are focused on driving profitable growth and value creation as we move from a period of fixing to a new era of building. We have a strong balance sheet and we expect free cash flow to significantly improve in fiscal 2024, approaching pre-COVID levels. Disney's Experiences business with its expansive offerings around the world is a key differentiator and remains a powerful growth engine, expanding operating margins by nearly 300 basis points over the past five years. As we transition ESPN to a streaming future and more fully integrate general entertainment content into Disney+, we will have a DTC offering unlike any other in the industry. And Disney's leadership and workforce around the world are second to none. When you combine all of that with our unrivaled portfolio of valuable businesses, brands and assets, and the way we manage them together, Disney has a strong hand that differentiates us from others in the industry. Our results this quarter are a testament to the work we've done across the company this past year and I'm bullish about the opportunities we have to create lasting growth and shareholder value and to strengthen Disney's position as the world's leading entertainment company. And with that, I will turn things over to Kevin.\nKevin Lansberry: Thank you, Bob. I appreciate your kind words at the outset of the call. It's been an honor serving as Interim CFO these past few months. We are excited to welcome Hugh to the Walt Disney Company and I look forward to working with both of you on all of this ahead. Now to dive into this quarter's results. Diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items, increased versus the prior year to $0.82 in the fiscal fourth quarter, and $3.76 for the full fiscal year. This past year has been marked by both transformation and execution. And we are pleased with the momentum we are building and the results we've realized, including meeting our guide of high single-digit percentage growth in both revenue and operating income for fiscal 2023. Total company revenues for the year increased 7% and segment operating income grew by 8%, excluding the impact of accelerated depreciation from the Galactic Starcruiser. And free cash flow for the year increased substantially, totaling close to $5 billion, driven by the work we've been doing on the cost efficiency front and by improvement in our underlying financial results. A few weeks ago, we published our recast financials, aligned to our newly reorganized segment structure. Today, I'll be walking through the fourth quarter's financial results for each of our three segments: Entertainment; Sports; and Experiences. And I'll also provide some color for the year ahead. Starting off with Entertainment. Q4 operating income grew by over $800 million versus the prior year quarter, driven by improvement in our direct-to-consumer business. We continue to make headway on our path to profitability in streaming with fourth quarter operating losses at our Entertainment D2C services improving by nearly $1 billion versus the prior year or $85 million sequentially to $420 million. Note that our Entertainment direct-to-consumer results exclude ESPN+. Including ESPN+ our combined streaming businesses and an operating loss in the fourth quarter of $387 million, a year-over-year improvement of a little over $1 billion and a sequential improvement of $125 million. As Bob noted earlier, we added nearly 7 million Disney+ core subs over the past quarter, reflecting strong content performance and our global summer promotion. Disney+ core ARPU increased sequentially by $0.12, driven by pricing increases and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by the impact of the summer promotion. The Disney+ ad tier added approximately 2 million subs during the fourth quarter and ended the fiscal year with 5.2 million subscribers. We anticipate core Disney+ subscribers in fiscal Q1 will decline slightly versus Q4 due to the expected temporary uptick in churn from the recent US price increases, as well as from the end of the summer promotion. However, we expect to see sub growth rebound later in the fiscal year. Growth in Entertainment D2C advertising revenue of 4% in Q4 versus the prior year, partially offset linear ad declines. The growth reflects an increase at Disney+ while Hulu results declined due to lower political and technology category advertising. We continue to expect to reach profitability at our combined streaming businesses in Q4 of fiscal 2024. Although as we have mentioned in the past, we don't expect linear progress from quarter to quarter. While we expect Entertainment D2C operating losses in Q1 to be generally in line with Q4 due to higher sports rights costs at ESPN+ aligned with the start of the NHL season, we anticipate a modest sequential decline in Q1 for the combined streaming business. Whereas we have also said previously, we anticipate upward momentum later in the fiscal year to be driven by realizing the full impact of price increases, the launch of the ad tier internationally and subscriber growth. At linear networks, which now excludes our sports channels, fourth quarter operating income was flat to the prior year, reflecting lower advertising and affiliate revenues which were generally offset by a decrease in marketing and programming and production costs. Advertising revenue declines were driven by our domestic business, primarily at ABC and our own TV stations. Domestic entertainment affiliate revenue decreased by 4% in the fourth quarter versus the prior year due to a 6 point decline from fewer subscribers, and a 1.5 point adverse impact from the Charter blackout, partially offset by roughly 4 point impact from higher rates. As Bob mentioned, we remain focused on driving additional cost efficiencies in this business over the long term. Content sales, licensing and other, lower operating results versus the prior year were due to lower theatrical results, partially offset by higher home entertainment results. We currently expect that first quarter operating income will be roughly breakeven and comparable to the prior year. Moving to our Sports segment. Q4 operating income increased by 14% versus the prior year. Results were driven by our domestic ESPN business from lower programming and production costs. Growth in subscription revenue at ESPN+ due to both pricing and sub growth and lower marketing costs, partially offset by lower affiliate revenue. The decrease in programming and production costs reflect the absence of the Big 10. And domestic ESPN linear advertising revenue increased by 1% in the fourth quarter versus the prior year, despite the absence of the Big 10, the charter blackout and a highly competitive marketplace. Domestic affiliate revenue decreased by a little less than 5% in Q4 versus the prior year as 5.5 points of growth from higher rates were offset by adverse impacts of approximately 7.5 points from fewer subscribers and two points from the charter blackout. As Bob referenced earlier, it's worth noting that ESPN's domestic business grew both full year revenue and operating income in each of the last two years. These results give us confidence in our belief that sports has the power to drive value for the company even in the face of challenging industry headwinds. Finally at Experiences. Fourth quarter operating results increased by over 30% versus the prior year quarter and 27% versus fiscal 2019. Operating margins at the segment were 22% in Q4, an increase of three percentage points versus the prior year. Our international operations continued their strong performance trend in the quarter with significant growth across all sites versus the prior year. Disney Cruise Line, Disney Vacation Club and Disneyland Resort also all saw strong year-over-year growth in both revenue and operating income, while Disney World operating results decreased, driven by the accelerated depreciation from the closure of the Galactic Starcruiser along with inflationary impacts and the continued comparison to the 50th Anniversary celebration in the prior year. Looking towards fiscal 2024, we anticipate robust annual operating income growth at Experiences to reflect continued strong performance at our International Parks and Disney Cruise Line. While domestic Parks and Experiences is expecting solid growth for the full year, that growth will be heavily back-end loaded due to continued challenging comparisons in the first half of the year from the 50th Anniversary at Walt Disney World in addition to wage inflation. We continue to be bullish on the long-term positioning of our Experiences business. As evidenced by our recent announcement, on significant investments we plan to make over the next 10 years to turbocharge growth in this area. We expect those investments to ramp up towards the back half of that 10-year period with more gradual increases in the first few years. As has been the case historically, CapEx for the parks are largely effectively self-funded, given the strong returns these investments generate over time and I would also note that a portion of the investments in our theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong is funded out of joint venture cash flows. Before we conclude and move to Q&A, there are a number of additional items I'd like to share for context on the year ahead. First on capital expenditures, fiscal 2023 CapEx totaled approximately $5 billion, roughly comparable to the prior year and in line with our most recent guidance. And we expect CapEx in fiscal 2024 to total $6 billion, an increase of approximately $1 billion versus fiscal 2023, driven by higher spend at Experiences. CapEx at Experiences in fiscal 2024 will look more comparable to fiscal 2019 levels and includes spend at our Cruise business ahead of the launch of three new ships in fiscal 2025 and 2026. Our enterprise-wide content spend in fiscal 2023 was $27 billion, in line with our guidance and about $3 billion below the prior year as we significantly reduced our spend on entertainment content. As a result of our continued work to be more efficient in our content spend, in addition to impacts from the strikes and the timing of sports payments, we expect total content spend in fiscal 2024 to be approximately $25 billion, which is a decrease of $2 billion versus 2023. Note that sports rights now account for over 40% of our enterprise-wide content spend. Our annualized entertainment cash content spend reduction target is now $4.5 billion, excluding strike impacts and sports rights versus $3 billion previously. We expect this to be realized on a cash basis in fiscal 2024, although it will take a few years for the bulk of these savings to be reflected in the P&L due to the timing of amortization. On the topic of cost-savings and streamlining our operations, we have eliminated over 8,000 roles, and while we are not currently planning to make further large-scale reductions to our workforce, we are taking significant concrete steps to continue addressing the cost basis of the overall company. We have increased our annualized efficiency target for total company SG&A and other operating expenses to $3 billion versus $2.5 billion previously, excluding the strike impacts. Approximately $2 billion of these efficiencies were achieved in fiscal 2023. Naturally, we also saw inflation and volume-related cost increases throughout the year, including higher content amortization and costs related to expanded operations at International Parks and Cruise, which were impacted by closures and limited operating capacity in the prior year. The remainder of these savings are expected to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2024. Our expense base in fiscal 2024 is expected to only increase slightly versus the prior year as these efficiencies and strike savings will mostly offset the year's planned volume-related growth and inflation. Adding the new $4.5 billion cash content spend reduction target to the $3 billion expense target brings our total annualized target to $7.5 billion as Bob announced earlier. All of these factors, in addition to continued growth and improvement across our underlying businesses are expected to come together over the coming fiscal year to result in free-cash flow generation of roughly $8 billion, a significant year-over-year increase and approaching levels we last achieved pre-pandemic. This continued robust free-cash flow growth alongside our strong balance sheet will position us well to address our investment and shareholder returns goals for the year and going-forward. To that end, we will be recommending to the Board that they declared dividend by the end of this calendar year. While this will be just the starting point, we do see ample opportunity to continue to increase shareholder returns in the future as our earnings and free-cash flow grow in the form of increased dividends or share buybacks, and we look-forward to sharing more as we move ahead. And with that, I will turn the call-back to Alexia for Q&A.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thanks, Kevin. As we transition to Q&A, we ask that you please try to limit yourself to one question in order to help us get to as many analysts as possible today. And with that operator, we're ready for the first questions.\nOperator: The first question will come from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. You may now go ahead.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. Hey, Bob, I have two quick one\u2019s for you. This is your first earnings call post the Charter-Disney Agreement. So stepping back, what are the most important impacts to Disney after that agreement? And then how would you imagine company differently now that that is kind of the template going forward for new deals? And secondly, on film studio, your first said you had the most amazing content cycle on film we've ever seen. So I wonder, what do you think is ailing the film slate this time around and what are your priorities to fixing this as you lay out one of your top three priorities? But what are you doing in particular to fix the film slate going forward? Thanks.\nRobert Iger: Thanks, Michael. Regarding Charter, first of all, as we said when we did the deal, we think it's a great deal for us. Also I think it's a great deal for Charter. It doesn't really change things much in terms of our strategy, because when you look at the deal, it actually ended up reflecting exactly what our strategic priorities are, that is streaming and the distribution agreement for Disney+ as part of the overall Charter deal does just that. So it leans into our streaming priorities, and that strategy doesn't change things much. Having the opportunity to consolidate a bit on the channel side is, I think, a good thing at this point. In terms of the studio, nice of you to mention just our great run. First of all, let's put things in perspective. Recently, we did have four really strong titles and four of the top 10 in the past year, led by Avatar, of course. But there were other successes, too. That said, as I've looked at our overall output, meaning, the studio, it's clear that the pandemic created a lot of challenges creatively for everybody, including for us. In addition, at the time the pandemic hit, we were leaning into a huge increase in how much we were making. And I've always felt that quantity can be actually a negative when it comes to quality. And I think that's exactly what happened. We lost some focus. And so, working with the talented team at the studio, we're looking to and working to consolidate, meaning, make less, focus more on quality. We're all rolling up our sleeves, including myself to do just that. We have obviously great assets, great stories to tell from the assets that we either have or that we purchased. And I feel really optimistic about the slate going forward, which is going to be a balance between some really strong sequels to some very, very popular titles, as well as some good original content, starting with Wish, which comes out Thanksgiving weekend. So I feel good about the direction we're headed, but I'm mindful of the fact that our performance from a quality perspective wasn't really up to the standards that we set for ourselves.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. You may now go ahead.\nSteven Cahall: Thank you. So first on DTC, I mean, pricing is about to step up. You announced the cost-cutting program. Some of which might be at DTC or Hulu. And Bob, I think for a couple of quarters you've just been talking about how confident you are in streaming profitability. So I'm not asking for guidance, but is there any way for us to just frame what DTC can look like beyond breakeven, since that's really the biggest driver of earnings growth and value creation? And then on the ESPN side, just as we think about that, preeminent sports platform that you're looking to build, so many folks have already voted with their feet to be outside of the bundle. How do you think about putting something into the market more quickly, maybe at a high price point that doesn't disrupt the bundle, just to see if the cord cutters or cord nevers have some demand? Thank you.\nRobert Iger: I'll take the second part first. Our plan when we bring ESPN direct-to-consumer, which is inevitable, which is going to happen, and we're planning for it, is to have what I'll call a soft landing, which is continue to make it available as part of the bundle for those people that want to remain in the bundle or people who feel that the bundle still has value to them, and at the same time to make it available on a true [indiscernible] basis in DTC form. So it is our hope that it will serve basically the consumer in two ways, in the traditional way and in a new way. And we'll obviously see in terms of where we end up the blend of basically consumers that stay in the bundle and those that leave. We're not concerned about it. And actually, as we model basically ESPN into the future, we see that in some cases it will continue to be sold as part of the bundle. And the first -- to the first question, the trajectory of DTC, we're not going to get specific and we're not giving any guidance beyond our guidance about becoming profitable at the end of 2024. But the building blocks are in place to turn this into a real growth business for us. And the recent announcement about purchasing the remaining stake in Hulu is just one of those building blocks. On the pricing side, we did take Disney+ prices up for the premium service, the non-advertiser supported by about 27%. It's still really early to tell, but we had taken those prices up significantly a year earlier and churn was de minimis. So we felt we have the room, particularly as we improve quality on the Disney+ service, where overall our strategy regarding pricing is more sophisticated, more coordinated across the world than it had been before. And as we look at growing that business, a smarter approach to pricing is one, bundling is another. I'm going to come back to the bundle between Disney+ and Hulu and then the opportunity to bundle ESPN. Clearly, we've got technology improvements in the works, whether it comes to account sharing, or whether it comes to basically lowering customer acquisition costs and churn, and lowering marketing expenses and growing margins. That's part of it. Advertising is a strong component of that. We did not take pricing up for Disney+ advertiser-supported services and the delta between the advertiser-supported and the premium services wider, because we like the ARPU that we get basically from both sides. So, we feel really good about the potential of this business. And look, if you think about the portfolio of streaming assets that we will have, Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN, that's a very, very strong hand. In December, we launched a beta version of Hulu and Disney+ combined. We feel really good about that. I saw some -- basically some demos of that just yesterday as a matter of fact. We are basically putting it in beta so that we can prepare parents largely to basically implement parental controls, because you'll be able to access Hulu programming on the same app. And then in late March we'll launch it basically in full form. And I think we have opportunities in terms of upsell capabilities, in terms of increasing engagement. We found that where we bundle, we lower churn. And again, these are steps that are all taken to ultimately turn this into a great business. Lastly, in terms of cost reductions, we created basically a one world approach to streaming. We had multiple organizations before. We now have one run globally by Dana Walden and Alan Bergman. They have created an entirely new senior management team across the globe to manage these assets. We're doing so much more cohesively, including, by the way, balancing spending in market, local spending and what I'll call global spending. One thing that we have recently really come to appreciate is the performance of our big title films, the so-called Pay 1 window films on the service. Elemental is one, Guardians of the Galaxy 3 was another, Little Mermaid is third. The numbers are huge. That's a differentiator for us certainly when it comes to competing with Netflix, for instance, which is the gold standard. But by leaning more into some of those films and while we improve the quality of them, gives us the ability to dial back a bit on some of the spending and investment in series. And that blend of spending between films and series, we believe, gives an opportunity to increase our margins and grow the business.\nAlexia Quadrani: All right. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. You may now go ahead.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thanks. Good afternoon. I want to come back to the free cash flow commentary because that's pretty interesting and new. And also ask you, Bob, about your US sports business and ESPN. So on cash flow, $8 billion of free cash flow, $6 billion of CapEx, getting the $14 billion of cash from operations. You haven't done a number like that, I think, since 2018. So I'm just trying to understand if you think you can sustain and grow your company at that level of cash content spent. I think Kevin said 2025, because that certainly allows you to really grow free cash flow from a base that's already higher than people were expecting in 2024. Hopefully, that made sense. And then on the sports side, Bob, people think about ESPN as a network facing cord cutting, et cetera. You clearly have a vision there that you think can grow over time. Can you talk a little bit about how you think about growing the sports business? Do you think you can, between linear and digital and other ancillary services, sort of grow your sports business over time? Because that would be another area where you'd certainly outperform expectations. Thanks so much.\nRobert Iger: I'll take the question about ESPN first. Interesting, I just saw statistics. ESPN is the number one brand on TikTok. Not the number one sports brand, not the number one media brand, the number one brand with about 44 million followers, which is an incredible statistic. ESPN is a very popular, high demand -- high in demand product in the United States, and unique, we believe, and we feel leaning into it is the smart thing to do because of its unique quality, how popular it is and how profitable it has been. We believe we have an opportunity there as we bring it in the direct-to-consumer direction. To strengthen our hand when we do that by partnering with either tech companies that can provide us with marketing technology support, customer acquisition help, or sports leagues that can provide us with more content. It's that simple. We're quite -- we are actually quite bullish about it. And frankly, if we were to just sit back and leave ESPN alone, kind of as part of the linear bundle, we know ultimately where that would bring us. It certainly wouldn't bring us in a growth direction because of the -- basically the continued decrease in multichannel subscribers. So this is a way to really buck that trend, continue to allow it to be part of the multichannel bundle, but also make it available on an [indiscernible] basis, basically taking a very popular product, in fact, and make it available and possibly strengthening it by doing what I described earlier. It's that simple. And we think about the building blocks of the company, which right now we believe there are four. One of them obviously is streaming overall. Another one we've talked about, which is Parks and Resorts and turbocharging that growth. The third I talked about earlier, which is returning the studio to basically the level of success that we became used to before the pandemic. And the fourth is turning ESPN into a preeminent digital sports platform. Kevin, you take the cash flow.\nKevin Lansberry: Yeah. With -- Ben, with respect to cash flow, we do feel good about where we are ending up in 2024 from a content spend perspective. And when you take a look at how we're getting to that year-over-year, lower content spend is clearly part of it. But continued growth and improvement of our underlying business is also a huge component of that, as is the annualized efficiency targets that we have all implemented. So those things are driving a significant amount of year-over-year improvement in our cash flow.\nAlexia Quadrani: All right. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with BofA Securities. You may now go head.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Yes, thank you. Excuse me. Thank you. Bob, I was wondering if you could give us your sort of holistic view on advertising and what's going on. I mean, we know money is going into like retail, media networks and things like that, but how much can you as a company make up on AVOD versus what's going on with linear? And maybe you can give us your view on what is going on with linear for you. And then on India, it\u2019s been notably challenging market consistent money loser. Can you talk about how -- your view of kind of ultimately where that winds up? Do you own it? Do you JV it? Do you exit the market?\nRobert Iger: Jessica, first of all, in India, our linear business actually does quite well. It's making money. But we know that other parts of that business are challenged for us and for others, and we are looking, I'll call it expansively. I know I've said this before. It always gets me in trouble. But we're considering our options there. We have an opportunity to strengthen our hand. It is, I think, now that maybe the most populous country in the world, or maybe just still second to China and about to pass them. We'd like to stay in that market. And -- but we also are looking to see whether we can strengthen our hand, obviously, improve the bottom line. In terms of advertising, we are actually finding that linear is a little bit stronger than we had expected it would be. It's not back as much as we would like. It's still challenged, but it's not as bad as it had been. So we've seen some slight improvement. Actually, the tech sector is still somewhat weak. But in general, overall, advertising has improved. We're finding, obviously, great demand for addressable advertising. I noted on an interview I did earlier that we've now put tools in place, or we're using tools on Disney+ to provide advertisers with better targeting. They're starting to work. And in general, sports has been very, very strong. So as we look at the advertising marketplace right now, while it's not as strong as we would like it to be, it's certainly not as bad as some people think it is. And it's working for us. On AVOD, look, it's very, very clear that the tools that the new platforms provide to advertisers are exactly what the advertisers are looking for. Those platforms are an advertiser's dream. And we know that the more data, the more detail, the more context, the more targeting we can provide, the better off we'll be. Hulu had an extremely robust advertising engine. We actually -- we've got one of the best in the business, if not the best. And so, actually, that combination of Hulu and Disney+ with some of the tools that we put in place, is going to give us the ability to have a blended CPM, grow engagement, grow advertising. So we're quite bullish about our position, media-wise in an advertising marketplace.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from John Hodulik with UBS. You may now go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Great, thanks. Maybe first, a follow up to Ben's question. Is there an opportunity for ESPN to add local sports rights, given what's happening to the RSN model, or potentially add sports rights to be distributed outside the US? That's the first question. And then second question is, Warner Brothers basically made some news recently by licensing some of their -- what would be considered some of their tentpole content, their DC Universe to Netflix. Is that something you think that Disney can do or can lean into, more -- at least more of that -- so than you're doing now without diluting the Disney brand or the Disney+ growth prospects? Thanks.\nRobert Iger: Good questions, John. Thank you. We've actually been licensing content to Netflix and are going to continue to. We're actually in discussion with them now about some opportunities, but I wouldn't expect that we will license our core brands to them. Those are real, obviously, competitive advantages for us and differentiators, Disney Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, for instance, all doing very, very well on our platform, and I don't see why, just basically to chase bucks we should do that when they are really, really important building blocks to the current and future of our streaming business. Regarding local sports, the technology that we will have for ESPN DTC will give us the ability to provide local sports in a pretty robust way, basically what the RSNs are doing. But we're not really aiming to do so by taking on significant risk. So if we can find the right kind of business arrangements and partnerships, I think we'll look very seriously at providing local sports as part of that platform. But again, not if it results in us taking on too much risk.\nAlexia Quadrani: All right. Thank you. Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our final question Phil Cusick with J. P. Morgan. You may now go ahead.\nPhilip Cusick: Hi, guys. Thank you. Bob. first follow up on ESPN, clearly a big priority. Can you give us some update on types of potential ESPN partners and what the hurdles might be to get those partnerships announced? And then second, maybe if you could dig into the recent trends of Parks. There's been some noise on pricing, but what have you seen from consumer demand, both in Orlando and around the country? And how do you think that Walt Disney World is doing versus the overall Orlando market? Thanks very much. A - Robert Iger The first question.\nAlexia Quadrani: First question was on the conversation [Multiple Speakers] A - Robert Iger Oh, thank you. Sorry. Sorry, Phil, I was kind -- I was listening to your second question. I forgot your first one. Senior moment. What basically we've been saying and what we've been exploring is that, as we prepare to take ESPN in the direct-to-consumer direction, we believe that we have opportunities to strengthen our hand with entities that either provide us with technology, marketing support, for instance, or companies or entities, I should say, that can provide us with more content. We feel we have an excellent hand, by the way, and could do it without that. But why not explore strengthening our hand? And so, since I noted that we were interested in this back in July, we've engaged with a number of different entities. I can say that there's significant interest out there. There are obviously complexities to it, but not complexities that were -- not hurdles that are so high that we can't jump over them. And we're going to continue to explore it. And I would imagine we'll have more to say about this in the coming months. But I don't want to say much more right now. Except again, there's serious interest out there, and I think there's a path or path to deals, but we're working through them. And obviously, as soon as they're completed, we'll let everybody know. You want to take the consumer demand question?\nKevin Lansberry: Yep. So with respect to the Parks, and I think we've talked about it in our prepared remarks with respect to Walt Disney World, and just we're lapping the 50th there. So we're going to continue to have a little bit of that lapping effect that will continue for a little bit as we go through Q1. But as I look out at the other domestic businesses, especially Disneyland continues to look exceptionally strong, as does Disney Cruise Line. So bookings at all of those continue to be very, very strong going forward. So domestically, we feel good and internationally we feel pretty good. So we're not really seeing anything in terms of an economic hangover.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks, Kevin. Thanks, Bob.\nAlexia Quadrani: Okay, thanks for the question and.

Please also note today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Alexia Quadrani, Executive Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani: Good afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to The Walt Disney Company's third quarter 2023 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay and transcript will also be made available on our website. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Lansberry, Interim Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Kevin, we will be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nRobert Iger: Thanks, Alexia, and good afternoon. In the eight months since I returned, we've undertaken an unprecedented transformation at Disney and this quarter's earnings reflect some of what we have accomplished. First, the company was completely restructured, restoring creativity to the center of our business. We made important management changes and efficiency improvements to create a more cost-effective, coordinated and streamlined approach to our operations. We aggressively reduced costs across the enterprise and we're on track to exceed our initial goal of $5.5 billion in savings. And perhaps most importantly, we've improved our DTC operating income by roughly $1 billion in just three quarters, as we continue to work toward achieving DTC profitability by the end of fiscal 2024. I'm pleased with how much we've gotten done in such a short period of time, but I also know we have a lot more to do. Before I turn the call over to Kevin Lansberry, our Interim CFO, I'd like to elaborate on the state of our company and the transformative work we are still undertaking. As I've said before, our progress will not always be linear. But despite near-term headwinds, I'm incredibly confident in Disney's long-term trajectory because of the work we've done, the team we have in place and because of Disney's core intellectual property foundation. Moving forward, I believe three businesses will drive the greatest growth and value creation over the next five years. They are our film studios, our parks business and streaming, all of which are inextricably linked to our brands and franchises. Looking to Disney Entertainment studios, we're focused on improving the quality of our films and on better economics, not just reducing the number of titles we release but also the cost per title. And we're maximizing the full impact of our titles by embracing the multiple distribution windows at our disposal, enabling consumers to access their content in multiple ways. For example, Avatar: The Way of Water, which is now the third highest grossing film of all time, is also on track to be the biggest ever electronic home video release for Disney domestically. Certain other titles will be sold in the download-to-own window as well. By focusing on big franchises and tentpole films, we're able to generate interest in our existing library. For example, we're seeing tremendous engagement on Disney+ with the previous Guardians of the Galaxy films, the original Avatar and the first four Indiana Jones movies. But the value of our Disney entertainment studios and the reason this will be a key growth business for us extends far beyond our library and new releases. What sets Disney apart are the numerous ways we're able to reach consumers with the stories and characters they love, including in our parks and resorts. We'll be opening new Frozen theme lands at Hong Kong Disneyland and Walt Disney Studios Park in Paris as well as the Zootopia theme land at Shanghai Disney Resort. And later down the road, we will be bringing an Avatar experience to Disneyland, reinforcing the unrivaled worldwide appeal of our brands and franchises. Our Parks and Experience segment overall has had an impressive streak and will continue to be a key growth engine for the company, even as we navigate the cycles that come with operating this business. Our Cruise Line in particular showed strong revenue and operating income growth in the third quarter. Current Q4 booked occupancy for our existing fleet of five ships is at 98% and we will be expanding our fleet by adding two more ships in fiscal '25 and another in fiscal '26, nearly doubling our worldwide capacity. In addition to our Cruise Line, strong segment results for the quarter were driven by solid performance at our international parks, and we also saw continued strength at Disneyland Resort. Our Asia parks have been doing exceptionally well, reinforcing a clear opportunity for continued growth. Both Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland have experienced stronger-than-expected recoveries from the pandemic. And in Q3, they both grew meaningfully in revenue, operating income and attendance. We saw softer performance at Walt Disney World from the prior year, coming off our highly successful 50th anniversary celebration. Also as post-COVID pent-up demand continues to level off in Florida, local tax data shows evidence of some softening in several major Florida tourism markets. And the strong dollar is expected to continue tamping down international visitation to the state. However, Walt Disney World is still performing well above pre-COVID levels, 21% higher in revenue and 29% higher in operating income compared to fiscal 2019, adjusting for Starcruiser accelerated depreciation. And following a number of recent changes we've implemented, we continue to see positive guest experience ratings in our theme parks, including Walt Disney World and positive indicators for guests looking to book future visits. This includes strong demand for our newly returned annual passes. We're making numerous investments globally to grow our parks business over the next five years, and I'm very optimistic about the future of this business over the long term. The third area that will drive growth and value creation for Disney is our direct-to-consumer business. When you consider our path to profitability in streaming, it's important to remember where we started and how we've adapted based on what we've learned. We overachieved with massive subscriber growth for Disney+ out of the gate and we leaned into a spending level to fuel subscriber growth, which had been the key measure of success for many. All of this happened while we were still determining the right strategies for pricing, marketing, content and specific international market investments. However, since my return, we've reset the whole business around economics designed to deliver significant, sustained profitability. We're prioritizing the strength of our brands and franchises. We're rationalizing the volume of content we make, what we spend and what markets we invest in. We're deploying the technology necessary to both improve the user experience as well as the economics of this business. We're harnessing windowing opportunities, perfecting our pricing and marketing strategies, maximizing our enormous advertising potential and we're making extensive Hulu content available to bundle subscribers via Disney+. As I announced last quarter, we're moving closer toward a more unified one-app experience domestically to pair high-quality general entertainment with content from our popular brands and franchises for our bundle subscribers. It's a formula for success that we have already proven in international markets with our Star offering on Disney+. We see a future where consumers can access even more of the company's streaming content all in one place, resulting in higher user engagement, lower churn and greater opportunities for advertisers. We're also very optimistic about the long-term advertising potential of this business. Even amid a challenging ad market, this quarter, we began seeing early signs of improvement. And I'm pleased to announce that as of the end of Q3, we've signed up 3.3 million subscribers to our ad-supported Disney+ option. Since its inception, 40% of new Disney+ subscribers are choosing an ad-supported product. On our pricing strategy, this year alone, we've raised prices in nearly 50 countries around the world to better reflect the value of our product offerings, and the impact on churn and retention has outperformed our expectations. Later today, we will release details regarding upcoming streaming price increases. And I'm pleased to share that our ad-supported Disney+ subscription offerings will become available in Canada and in select markets across Europe, beginning November 1, while a new ad-free bundled subscription plan featuring Disney+ and Hulu will be available in the U.S. on September 6. Maintaining access to our content for as broad an audience as possible is top of mind for us, which is why pricing for our stand-alone ad-supported Disney+ and Hulu offerings will remain unchanged. I'd also like to note that we are actively exploring ways to address account sharing and the best options for paying subscribers to share their accounts with friends and family. Later this year, we will begin to update our subscriber agreements with additional terms on our sharing policies and we will roll out tactics to drive monetization sometime in 2024. Our DTC ambitions also extend to our sports business. Taking our ESPN flagship channels direct-to-consumer is not a matter of if but when. And the team is hard at work looking at all components of this decision, including pricing and timing. It's interesting to note that ratings continue to increase on ESPN's main linear channel even as cord cutting has accelerated. This rating strength creates tremendous advertising potential across the board. Our total domestic sports advertising revenue for linear and addressable is up 10% versus the prior year adjusted for comparability, which speaks to the fact that the sports business stands tall and remains a good value proposition. We believe in the power of sports and the unique ability to convene and engage audiences. Yesterday, it was announced that ESPN has entered into an exclusive licensing arrangement with PENN Entertainment to further extend the ESPN brand into the growing sports betting marketplace. This licensing deal will offer a compelling new experience for sports fans that will enhance consumer engagement. We're excited to offer this to the many fans who have long been asking for it. Overall, we're considering potential strategic partnerships for ESPN, looking at distribution, technology, marketing and content opportunities where we retain control of ESPN. We've received notable interest from many different entities, and we look forward to sharing more details at a later date when we're further along in this process. Looking to our broader linear business. While linear remains highly profitable for Disney today, the trends being fueled by cord cutting are unmistakable. And as I've stated before, we are thinking expansively and considering a variety of strategic options. However, we're fortunate to have an array of extremely productive television studios that we will rely on to continue providing exceptional content for audiences well into the future. And speaking of the content we create, I'd like to say a few words about the ongoing strikes. Nothing is more important to this company than its relationships with the creative community, and that includes actors, writers, animators, directors and producers. I have deep respect and appreciation for all those who are vital to the extraordinary creative engine that drives this company and our industry. And it is my fervent hope that we quickly find solutions to the issues that have kept us apart these past few months, and I am personally committed to working to achieve this result. In closing, I returned to Disney in November and have agreed to stay on longer because there is more to accomplish before our transformation is complete and because I want to ensure a successful transition for my successor. In spite of a challenging environment in the near term, I'm overwhelmingly bullish about Disney's future for the reasons I shared at the beginning of this call. The work we've done over these past eight months are core foundation of creative excellence and iconic brands and franchises and because of the unrivaled talent we have at every level here at Disney. I have the highest confidence in our leadership team today, and I'm enormously proud of the ways each of them is helping steer the company through this moment of great change. And with that, I'll turn things over to Kevin.\nKevin Lansberry: Thanks, Bob. It's good to be here and good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal third quarter diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items were at $1.03, a decrease of $0.06 versus the prior year. In the coming months, we will be presenting recast financials in line with our new reorganized segments: Disney Entertainment, ESPN, and Parks, Experiences and Products. So today will be the last earnings call, where we will discuss our numbers under the existing structure. Now turning to this quarter's results. Starting off with direct-to-consumer. As Bob referenced earlier, we've improved direct-to-consumer operating results by $1 billion in just three quarters. For Q3, operating losses improved by approximately $150 million versus the prior quarter and by approximately $550 million versus the prior year. These results outperformed the guidance we gave on the last earnings call, largely due to lower-than-expected expenses, including from realizing SG&A savings sooner than initially expected. Disney+ core subscribers grew by nearly 800,000 during the third quarter, in line with the commentary we made at our last earnings call, with international growth more than offsetting modest domestic net losses. As Bob mentioned, our progress will vary from quarter-to-quarter and we are more focused on overall economics versus pure sub growth. But currently, we do expect that in the fourth quarter, we will see core Disney+ net adds rebound with growth both domestically and internationally. Disney+ core ARPU increased sequentially by $0.11 driven by higher per subscriber advertising revenue domestically, as well as price increases in certain international markets. With over 40% of gross adds opting for the ad tier, the domestic Disney+ ad tier is continuing to improve our ARPU. And we look forward to the additional market launches announced today, which should serve as a stepping stone on our path to profitability. Disney+ Hotstar subscribers declined this quarter as we adjusted our product from one centered around the IPL to one more balanced with other sports and entertainment offerings. I would also note that this business with its significantly lower ARPU compared to core Disney+ is not a material component of our overall D2C financial results. We will therefore continue to focus our commentary on the core Disney+ product. Hulu and ESPN+ subscribers were roughly comparable to Q2. Hulu remained profitable in the third quarter with advertising revenue increasing versus the second quarter, benefiting sequentially from a higher sell-through rate. In Q4, we expect D2C ad revenue to continue to benefit from higher advertiser demand at Hulu as well as from the ramp-up of the Disney+ ad tier. As we work toward achieving D2C profitability by the end of fiscal 2024, we don't necessarily expect the progress to be linear each quarter as the impacts of the transformative work we are doing take time to realize. We expect to see more meaningful improvement in our D2C losses by middle of fiscal 2024. These expectations and plans remain subject to all of the risks and assumptions we previously identified and are noting here today, which will require close and ongoing assessment. But we remain encouraged by the early results we've already realized and are optimistic about our path ahead. Moving on to our content sales line of business. Operating results declined by a little over $200 million versus the prior year. Lower results in the third quarter versus the prior year were due to lower TV/SVOD and theatrical results. For Q4, we expect this business to generate operating losses up to $100 million worse than last year's fourth quarter. And at Linear Networks, operating income declined versus the prior year by $580 million driven by declines at both domestic and international channels. The decrease at domestic channels was driven by lower advertising and affiliate revenue and by higher programming and production costs driven by the NBA and the new Formula One agreement. While domestic linear advertising revenue declined year-over-year, ESPN ad revenue increased by 4%, demonstrating the relative strength of sports. Quarter-to-date, ESPN domestic linear cash ad sales are pacing down, reflecting in part the absence of the Big 10 this year. It's worth noting, however, that the absence of the Big 10 is expected to drive overall operating income favorability in Q4 versus the prior year. The fourth quarter will also hold one additional Monday night football game versus the prior year. Linear advertising continues to see impacts from market softness. While sports is healthy, entertainment continues to face headwinds. Note that we expect D2C advertising year-over-year growth to partially offset linear declines in the fourth quarter. And we wrap this year's upfront with overall volume roughly in line with the prior year. Growth in addressable revenue increased, representing over 40% of the total upfront volume, and sports pricing is up single digits across the board. Domestic Linear Networks affiliate revenue decreased by 2% from the prior year due to a 6-point decline from fewer subscribers, partially offset by 4 points of growth from contractual rate increases. International channels operating income decreased versus the prior year, driven by lower advertising revenue and to a lesser extent, an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Our Parks, Experiences and Products portfolio of businesses continues to be an earnings and free cash flow growth driver for the company, with both revenue and operating income increasing by more than 10% versus the prior year. International parks continued its strong growth trend with year-over-year operating income increasing at all our international sites, but most significantly at Shanghai Disney, which saw record highs from a revenue, OI and margin perspective. At domestic Parks and Experiences, operating income was up 24% versus pre-pandemic results in fiscal '19, but declined 13% versus the prior year. In addition to the inflationary cost pressures we have discussed on prior calls and some of the near-term headwinds at Walt Disney World that Bob mentioned earlier, results reflect an approximately $100 million accelerated depreciation charge related to the closure of the Galactic Starcruiser. These drivers were partially offset by favorable performance at our Cruise Line and at the Disneyland Resort. While Walt Disney World results were down year-over-year, as Bob mentioned, operating income was nearly 30% higher versus 2019 when adjusting for the Starcruiser accelerated depreciation. Domestic parks attendance grew slightly year-over-year, reflecting comparisons against last year's strong trends coming out of the 50th anniversary at Walt Disney World. Per cap spending was comparable to the prior year with contributions from pricing, Genie+ and higher food and beverage spend offset by attendance composition changes and lower merchandise spend. Excluding the impact of the Starcruiser accelerated depreciation, domestic parks and Experiences operating margins in Q3 were roughly 3 percentage points below the prior year, and DPEP margins were slightly higher than the prior year. We continue to expect some moderation in demand at our domestic parks, as we compare against our highly successful 50th anniversary celebration at Walt Disney World and the burn-off of pent-up demand persists, while elevated travel costs are impacting international visitation. We are also seeing continued cost pressures in the fourth quarter, predominantly from labor wage rate growth, coupled with $150 million of remaining accelerated depreciation for the Galactic Starcruiser. However, we still expect all-in Q4 operating margins at DPEP to exceed the prior year due to the ongoing strength of recovery at our international parks and Cruise Line. Putting this all together, excluding the impact of accelerated depreciation for the Starcruiser, we are still expecting full year total company revenue and segment operating income to grow at a high-single digit percentage rate versus the prior year. We currently expect fiscal 2023 content spend to come in at approximately $27 billion, which is lower than we previously guided due to lower spend on produced content, in part due to the writers' and actors' strikes. We now expect capital expenditures for the year to total $5 billion. This is lower than our prior guide, primarily due to spending timing shifts for various projects across the enterprise. In the midst of the transformative work we have been doing, we are prioritizing long-term free cash flow growth and have generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow in the third quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong with our single A credit ratings reflecting that strength. We have made significant progress deleveraging coming out of the pandemic, and we continue to approach capital allocation in a disciplined and balanced manner, prioritizing investments to generate future growth while also keeping an eye towards shareholder returns. And to that point, as we've mentioned before, we still expect to be in a position to recommend that the Board declared a modest dividend by the end of this calendar year with the intention to recommend increased shareholder returns over time as our earnings and free cash flow power grows. And with that, I will turn it back over to Alexia for Q&A.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thanks, Kevin. As we transition to the Q&A, we ask that you please try to limit yourself to one question in order to help us get to as many as possible today. And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nPhilip Cusick: Hi. Thank you. Bob, the linear business is clearly under pressure and you made it clear recently that all options are being considered. I'm curious, though, what the practical considerations are of separating assets like ABC, National Geographic or others from both ESPN or sports or integrated or from Hulu, which is kind of the next-generation distribution platform. Can you talk about that? And then second, can we assume that most of those TV assets have been fully depreciated? Thank you.\nRobert Iger: Clearly, if we are to do anything significant in terms of, call it, strategic direction to the linear nets, we have to keep in mind the need for content to ultimately fuel our DTC businesses, notably and as you mentioned Hulu. So anything that is to be done would be done with an eye toward maintaining a rich flow of content to fuel our growth business, and that will be streaming. There's obviously complexity as it relates to decoupling the linear nets from ESPN, but nothing that we feel we can't contend with if we were to ultimately create strategic realignment.\nKevin Lansberry: And Phil, this is Kevin. With respect to the assets, these have been around for quite a while at this point and we're not going to comment specifically on where they sit from a depreciation standpoint.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from BoA. Please go ahead with your question.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. Bob, maybe just a follow-up on your prepared remarks and film being core strategic. Can you share with us how you plan to improve the movie performance and maybe the time frame or create more original content? Just give us more color. And then a follow-up to something you said on DTC and password crackdown, is this a fiscal '24 full year? Like will you be done by the end of the year and is it on a global basis? How many password shares do you think there are on your platform?\nRobert Iger: So the second part of your question, Jessica, regarding password sharing, we are -- we already have the technical capability to monitor much of this. And I'm not going to give you a specific number, except to say that it's significant. What we don't know, of course, is as we get to work on this, how much of the password sharing as we basically eliminate it will convert to growth in subs. Obviously, we believe there will be some, but we're not speculating. What we are saying, though, is that in calendar '24, we're going to get at this issue. And so while it is likely you'll see some impact in calendar '24, it's possible that we won't be complete or the work will not be completed within the calendar year. But we certainly have established this as a real priority and we actually think that there's an opportunity here to help us grow our business. Regarding our studio performance, let's put things in perspective a little bit. The studio has had a tremendous run over the last decade, perhaps the greatest run that any studio has ever had with multiple billion-dollar hits and including, by the way, too, that were relatively recent were one, in particular, Avatar: The Way of Water. And we also had a pretty strong performance with Guardians of the Galaxy 3, which has done, I think, approximately $850 million in global box office. That said, the performance of some of our recent films has definitely been disappointing and we don't take that lightly. And as you'd expect, we're very focused on improving the quality and the performance of the films that we've got coming up. It's something that I'm working closely with the studio on. I'm personally committed to spending more time and attention on that as well.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thank you. Good afternoon. Bob, we've -- the press is out with the price increase information for later this year tonight. I'm just wondering now that you've been through one Disney+ price increase here in the U.S. and multiple Hulu and ESPN increases sort of how you're thinking about the pricing power of the product as you go into these even more significant increases and whether you think you can hold your customer base as you raise prices. And obviously, some big news with ESPN Bet. Why now and why PENN? Can you just talk about your vision or Jimmy's vision for the ESPN product over time that stems from this announcement and other thoughts on ESPN's future?\nRobert Iger: Ben, as you know, I think as we've said before, we took a pretty significant price increase at Disney+ sometime late in calendar '22. And we really didn't see significant churn or loss of subs because of that, which was actually heartening. It's important to note, though, that the price increase that we've just announced is a price increase for the premium product or the non-advertiser-supported product. We're actually keeping the advertiser supported product flat in terms of prices. That's being done for a reason. Obviously, as has been noted by Kevin in his remarks, the advertising marketplace for streaming is picking up. It's more healthy than the advertising marketplace for linear television. We believe in the future of advertising on our streaming platforms, both Disney+ and Hulu. And we're obviously trying with our pricing strategy to migrate more subs to the advertiser-supported tier. It also should be noted, as I think I mentioned in my remarks, that a substantial amount of new subscribers to Disney+ are signing up for the ad-supported tier, which suggests that the pricing is working for us in that regard. So we're looking at this very carefully. One thing I think that I should also note is that we grew this business really fast, really before we even understood what our pricing strategy should be or could be. And we're really just getting at, and I'd say in the last six months, the pricing strategy that's really aimed at enabling us to improve the bottom line ultimately to turn this into a growth business and as a component of that, obviously, to grow subs.\nBenjamin Swinburne: On ESPN?\nRobert Iger: On ESPN Bet, you say why now? Well, we've been in discussions with a number of entities over a fairly long period of time. It's something that we've wanted to accomplish, obviously, because we believe there's an opportunity here to significantly grow engagement with ESPN consumers, particularly young consumers. And PENN, why PENN? Because PENN stepped up in a very aggressive way and made an offer to us that was better than any of the competitive offers by far. And we like the fact that PENN is going to use this as a growth engine for their business. And we actually believe and trust in their ability to \u2013 in this partnership to grow their business nicely while we grow ours.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thank you.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks, Hey, Bob. I have a few, if you could. One is, given the thinking you've done about the future of Disney, why does it make sense to create two Disney companies: one focused on parks, CP, Disney+ and then the studio IP that drives that flywheel, and then one on everything else? So why not make a clean break? And then secondly, on ESPN, you've been talking about partnerships. I wonder if you have a vision for the streaming content vision of ESPN that's different than the linear one we see, perhaps a sports funded with other networks or with lead partnership. So can you just expand on how the product will look differently down the road in streaming than it does now and late on (ph)?\nRobert Iger: Michael, on the first part, I'm not going to comment on the future structure of the company or the asset makeup of the company. As I've said, we're looking at strategic options both for ESPN and for the Linear Networks, obviously, addressing all the challenges that those businesses are facing. I'm looking forward to reading your thesis on it. Maybe you'll give us some ideas about it, but I'm not going to make any comments about it right now. Regarding the second question and ESPN, the strategic partnerships that we're looking to create and that we're actually in discussions about are aimed at accomplishing a few things: one, content, meaning increasing the content that ESPN offers; and two, possibly, I'll call it distribution and marketing support. And it's possible that we'll be able to do both as -- and this is all being done with an eye toward the inevitability of taking the SPN flagship over the top. So when we look ahead and we see a business that will be a direct -- primarily a direct-to-consumer business, we obviously have an eye toward how much content do we need in order to make that a successful business. That obviously ties to what the pricing model need to be and actually, how much distribution support we need. We benefited greatly from the distribution support in the old business model from cable and satellite. Obviously, when you go DTC, you're kind of doing it on your own or maybe not or maybe there's an opportunity with another entity to help in that regard. So we're basically looking quite expansively. I must say we're extremely encouraged with all the interest that we've had already in this regard. And I think it's safe to assume, as we ultimately turn this into a streaming business, while we have a phenomenal hand right now better than anyone else in terms of the content that ESPN offers that -- we believe that adding more content in under economical circumstances might be a wise thing.\nMichael Nathanson: Okay. Thanks, Bob.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nSteven Cahall: Thank you. Bob, you said you're now on track to exceed that initial goal of $5.5 billion in cost savings, and DTC came in ahead in the quarter. As you think about the future of this business long term and getting to kind of the price and cost structure that you're aiming for, do you have any expectations for longer-term DTC margins? It just seems like you're meaningfully below where Netflix was at a similar revenue scale. So I'm wondering how you think about that 15% or 20% margin level as that business gets above $20 billion in revenue this year. And then just secondly, as a follow-up, given that you have the Hulu put coming up next year, what are your thoughts on your ability to fund that transaction as we head into that time horizon? Thank you.\nRobert Iger: Our streaming business is still actually very young. In fact, it's not even four years old. It launched in November of 2019. And we love to have the margins that Netflix has. They've accomplished those margins though, over a substantially longer period of time and they've done so because they figured out how to really carefully balance their investment in programming with their pricing strategy and what they spend in marketing. Because we're new at all of this, we actually have not really achieved the kind of balance we know we need to achieve in terms of cost savings and pricing and money spent on marketing. And of course, all the other things that we're looking at from a technological perspective that grows engagement with our customers, for instance, recommendation engines would be one example of that, that have the ability to improve performance or obviously grow consumption. So I would say that -- and I obviously have to -- I can't emphasize enough the time that we spent and the effort that we spent on managing costs. We've done a tremendous job in a very, very short period of time of exceeding the cost reductions that we said we were going to achieve and that's obviously a major step in the direction of improving our margins. Pricing, as we've talked about earlier on this call and in our comments, is another way to do that. Password sharing is another way to do that. Getting the technology in place to grow engagement, the advertising side of this business is another. So I'm reasonably optimistic and hopeful that we will be improving our margins in this business significantly over the next few years. But I'm not going to make any further predictions in that except -- the good news is that we know how much work we have to do. We know the work that we have to do as well.\nKevin Lansberry: And Steven, I'll answer the question with respect to Hulu put. So I'll remind everyone that the floor to that put is about $9.2 billion. We're very comfortable with our current liquidity position. We've got about $11.5 billion of cash on our balance sheet, got about $10.5 billion worth of revolving credit facilities and commercial paper. And so we -- and we're going to have plenty of future cash flow to help fund all of this going forward. I would also like to note that from a balance sheet perspective, we've got a strong single A credit rating that reflects the strength that we see in our balance sheet. We made significant progress recently, deleveraging coming out of the pandemic. We're prioritizing free cash flow as a company. And we're being really disciplined and smart about how we go about allocating capital across the company. And last but not least, as I noted in my prepared remarks, we hope to still be in a position \u2013 or we plan to still be in a position at the end of this year to recommend to the Board of Directors that we put a modest dividend out.\nAlexia Quadrani: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. So Bob, I mean, on the ESPN side, you've spoken about the need for partners. Could you talk a little bit about the priorities when you look at partners? Is it more in the form of direct capital infusion or maybe some kind of reach on the distribution side when it comes to streaming? What are the objectives you're really solving for? And then, Kevin, maybe as a follow-up to the guidance, just triangulating between some of the segment guidance that you just gave and trends in the first three quarters. The full year high-single digit guide in the operation is obviously great. But it will need more acceleration in Q4 than we've seen in the first three quarters of OI. So if you could just talk through what the drivers of that acceleration, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nRobert Iger: Kannan, we're not necessarily looking for cash infusion when it comes to partners. We're looking for partners that are going to help ESPN successfully transition to a DTC model. And that, as I've said, can come in the form of either content or distribution and marketing support or both.\nAlexia Quadrani: And Kannan, can you repeat your second question, please?\nKannan Venkateshwar: So in terms of the guidance for high-single digit OI growth, just triangulating between the trends in the first three quarters and some of the segment guidance in the quarter, it seems to imply growth in the fourth quarter will be higher for OI. And so I just wanted to understand what the drivers of that acceleration.\nKevin Lansberry: Yeah, Kannan. There's very significant growth across our direct-to-consumer business and at our Parks and Experiences business also. So those two businesses predominantly are the big growth drivers as you begin to look at relative to the prior year where we\u2019re getting that kind of growth.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks. So I'm curious how your experience with Disney+ Hotstar shape your view on your long-term international streaming strategy. Are you thinking about maybe exiting those markets or any markets and maybe focusing more on content licensing or partnerships? And is it essential that you reshape that international strategy in any way to meet your long-term profitability objectives?\nRobert Iger: We actually have been looking at multiple markets around the world with an eye toward prioritizing those that are going to help us turn this business into a profitable business. What that basically means is there are some markets that we will invest less in local programming but still maintain the service. There are some markets that we may not have a service at all. And there are others that we'll consider, I'll call it, high-potential markets where we'll invest nicely for local programming, marketing and basically full-service content in those markets. Basically, what I\u2019m saying is not all markets are created equal. And in terms of our march to profitability, one of the ways we believe we\u2019re going to do that is by creating priorities internationally.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Morris from Guggenheim. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Morris: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. So on the theme of considering options for Disney, there was an article published recently that speculated that the entire company could be sold to a larger technology company. So Bob, my straightforward question is, do you see a plausible scenario where the entire company would be sold? Maybe a bit more broadly, though, when you think of maximum value of the Disney enterprise, do you think that can be achieved by being more aligned with a single technology partner or is that value maximized through partnering with a variety of tech platforms? And if I could just sneak one in on the PENN Gaming announcement. Does it -- will you forego advertising partnerships with all other betting or sports gaming partners? And if so, how much impact will that have in exchange for building value in this partnership?\nRobert Iger: Michael, I just am not going to speculate about the potential for Disney to be acquired by any company, whether a technology company or not. Obviously, anyone who want to speculate about these things would have to immediately consider the global regulatory environment. I'll say no more than that. It's just -- it's not something that we obsess about.\nKevin Lansberry: Great. And then, Michael, with respect to any foregone economics or no longer accepting advertising from other gaming companies, I don't see us in a position where we'll ever be in that situation. So...\nAlexia Quadrani: Okay. Thanks for the question, and I want to thank everyone for joining us today.

So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nRobert Iger: Thank you Alexia, and good afternoon, everyone. Allow me to digress for a moment to congratulate Universal for the tremendous success of Super Mario Brothers. It certainly proves people love to be entertained in theatres around the world and it gives us reason to be optimistic about the movie business. Now turning to our results. We're pleased with our accomplishments this quarter, which are reflective of the strategic changes we've been making throughout our businesses. We're also proud of what we continue to deliver for consumers, from movies to television to sports, news and our theme parks. A few recent highlights include Marvel Studios Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3, which topped the global box office in its opening weekend with $289 million. The first round of the NBA playoffs was the most watched ever across Disney networks, and we've been averaging 5 million viewers throughout the first 22 games, up 15% versus the comparable point in last year's playoffs. ABC continued its run as the number one entertainment broadcast network for the fourth consecutive season. And at our domestic parks, we continued to improve the guest experience with our recent pricing changes and exciting new attractions, including the Reimagined Mickey's Toontown at Disneyland and TRON Lightcycle Run at Walt Disney World. I've been back at the company for almost six months, and in that time we've embarked on a significant transformation to strategically realign Disney for sustained growth and success. I\u2019m pleased to say that the strategy we detailed last quarter is working. Our new organizational structure is returning authority and accountability to our creative leaders, as well as allowing for a more efficient, coordinated, and streamlined approach to our operations. The cost-cutting initiatives I announced last quarter are well underway, and we're on track to meet or exceed our target of $5.5 billion. We're delivering progress on the number of fronts, including a reduction in streaming operating losses this quarter, and I'm very optimistic about our direct to consumer business longer-term. Combined, our brands, franchises, and robust library are a significant differentiator in the space, and the meteoric subscriber growth we've seen since our launch three years ago only further reinforces that. As I think about our path forward in streaming, we have a number of clear opportunities to further position our DTC business for success. First, as a significant step toward creating a growth business, I'm pleased to announce that we will soon begin offering a one-app experience domestically that incorporates our Hulu content via Disney+. And while we continue to offer Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ as standalone options, this is a logical progression of our DTC offerings that will provide greater opportunities for advertisers while giving bundles of subscribers access to more robust and streamlined content, resulting in greater audience engagement and ultimately leading to a more unified streaming experience. We will begin to roll out this one-app offering by the end of the calendar year, and we look forward to sharing more details in the future. Despite the near-term macro headwinds of the overall marketplace today, the advertising potential of this combined platform is incredibly exciting. And when you drill down into the details, you can see why. Over 40% of our domestic advertising portfolio is addressable, including streaming, which we expect will continue to grow over time. We're also focused on the growth opportunity in programmatic advertising, and we are well positioned to scale as the market improves and audiences continue to grow. We've added more than 1,000 advertisers over the past year, and now have 5,000 advertisers across our streaming platforms, with over a third buying advertising programmatically today. In addition, we plan to launch our ad tier on Disney+ in Europe by the end of this calendar year, which will drive both increased inventory and revenue over the long-term. The truth is we have only just begun to scratch the surface of what we can do with advertising on Disney+. And I'm incredibly bullish on our longer term advertising positioning. Meanwhile, the pricing changes we've already implemented have proven successful and we plan to set a higher price for our ad-free tier later this year to better reflect the value of our content offerings. As we look to the future, we will continue optimizing our pricing model to reward loyalty and reduce churn, to increase subscriber revenue for the premium ad-free tier, and drive growth of subscribers who opt for the lower cost ad-supported option. Additionally, I'd like to share a few other key areas where we see opportunities for improvements in our streaming business. First, it's critical we rationalize the volume of content we're creating and what we're spending to produce our content. Second, our legacy platforms enable us to expand our audiences and often augment our potential streaming success while at the same time allowing us to amortize our content costs across multiple windows. We also need to strike the right balance between our local and global programming as well as our platform and program marketing. Finally, we must continue calibrating our investments in specific markets, looking at the total addressable market and ARPU prospects and evaluating the profitability potential. All of these factors combined are why we are confident that we're on the right path for streaming's long-term profitability. The strength of our content, the one-app experience, and the enormous advertising potential that comes with it, rationalizing the volume of the content we make and what we're spending, maximizing windowing opportunities, recalibrating our investments internationally, perfecting our pricing model, and consolidating our global streaming business under the leadership of Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman, Alan Bergman and Dana Walden. We're doing the essential work now to position our streaming business for sustained growth and success in the future. Turning to our parks, we see this business as a key growth driver for the company. This past quarter, we've been especially pleased with the performance of our parks internationally. We have several international expansions underway that will allow our parks to continue to build capacity and drive longer-term growth. At Disneyland Paris, our Avengers Campus has been a resounding success in its first year. And we have on-going investment underway there, including a Frozen-inspired land currently in development. Our Zootopia-inspired expansion opens later this year at Shanghai Disney Resort. Arendelle, the World of Frozen expansion, is set to open at Hong Kong Disneyland in the second half of 2023. And Tokyo Disney Resort, which is currently celebrating its 40th anniversary, will be opening the new Frozen Kingdom, Rapunzel's Forest, and Peter Pan's Neverland in the coming year. Regarding our domestic parks, we just announced additional changes coming in 2024 that will improve the experience for guests visiting Walt Disney World, including further expanding access for annual pass holders to visit on certain days without reservations, as well as removing the need for an additional reservation for guests with date-based tickets. This is just another example of how we're continuously listening to our guests and finding ways to improve their experiences. And we have a number of other growth and expansion opportunities at our parks and we're closely evaluating where it makes the most sense to direct future investments. The unyielding popularity of our world-class parks business and our unparalleled content, powered by our brands and franchises, is what sets Disney apart. From the very beginning, 100 years ago, our timeless stories and characters have been the key to our success and hold a special place in the hearts of generations of fans and families. We're leaning into this across every segment of our business, as illustrated with our strong summer slate of theatrical releases, including Disney's The Little Mermaid, Pixar's Elemental, and Lucasfilm's Indiana Jones and The Dial of Destiny. As we've been looking at the structure of the company these past several months, what's become clear is that there is an enormous opportunity to harness our full potential by increasing alignment and coordination in marketing across our businesses. That's why I named Asad Ayaz our first ever Chief Brand Officer in addition to his role as President of Marketing for our studios. For years, our businesses have been incredibly successful in marketing our content, experiences, and products. And now with greater integration of our touch points with consumers, especially streaming, we're able to be more efficient and more successful in reaching the right audiences with the right offerings from across our businesses. Disney means so much to so many people around the world. That's a privilege we take seriously. And I know I speak for our terrific Chairman, Alan, Dana, Jimmy and Josh, when I say that our goal is to continue finding innovative new ways that allow guests and audiences to have even deeper connections with us. And that's why I'm so thrilled to be taking this more proactive approach to our brand and marketing work. With that, I will turn things over to Christine.\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks Bob and good afternoon everyone. Excluding certain items, fiscal second quarter, diluted earnings per share, or $0.93, a decrease of $0.15 versus the prior year. As improvements that deep up and direct to consumer, we're more than offset by declines at our linear network's business. As Bob mentioned, we are making excellent progress on our cost-cutting initiatives and are on track to meet or exceed the efficiency targets we outlined last quarter. During Q2, we took a restructuring charge over approximately $150 million, primarily related to severance. While we are continuing to refine our estimates, we currently expect to record additional severance charges of approximately $180 million over the remainder of this fiscal year with the bulk of that additional charge expected in the third quarter. We are in the process of reviewing the content on our DTC services to align with the strategic changes in our approach to content curation that you've heard Bob discuss. As a result, we will be removing certain content from our streaming platforms and currently expect to take an impairment charge of approximately $1.5 million to $1.8 billion. The charge, which will not be recorded in our segment results, will primarily be recognized in the third quarter as we complete our review and remove the content. And going forward, we intend to produce lower volumes of content in alignment with this strategic shift. Now, to dive into our quarterly results by segment, starting with our Media and Entertainment Distribution Business, a year-over-year decline in operating income was driven primarily by a $1 billion decrease at linear networks. DTC results improved versus a prior year in content sales licensing and other operating results in the second quarter declined modestly. At linear networks, results were consistent with guidance given last quarter, driven by decreases of approximately $800 million at our domestic linear networks and $160 million at our international linear networks. The domestic results decreased at both cable and broadcasting. At cable, this is largely due to higher sports programming and production costs, which were driven by the timing of costs for the college football playoff and the NFL we discussed last quarter. In addition to NBA contractual rate increases and higher sports production costs. Lower broadcasting results reflected decreases in advertising revenue across the ABC network and our own television stations. Second quarter domestic linear networks affiliate revenue decreased by 2% from the prior year, driven by a 6 point decline from fewer subscribers, partially offset by 3 points of growth from contractual rating increases. Rate growth was adversely impacted by 1 percentage point from the timing of revenue recognition from certain non-owned TV stations. Second quarter, domestic linear advertising revenue declined 10% year-over-year, although ESPN ad revenue is up 2% or flat when adjusted for certain non-comparable items, including CFP timing. The sports advertising marketplace is currently stable, with quarter-to-date ESPN domestic linear cash ads sales pacing up. However, the overall entertainment advertising marketplace has been challenging. While the weakness has moderated somewhat, we anticipate that some softness may continue into the back half of the fiscal year. But as Bob mentioned, we are optimistic about our ability to continue to be a leader in advertising throughout the business cycle, particularly as it relates to our capabilities in addressable and programmatic. And we look forward to sharing more details at our upfront presentation next week. International channels operating income decreased versus the prior year, driven by lower advertising revenue, partially offset by lower programming costs. Moving on to the direct-to-consumer, operating losses improved sequentially by approximately $400 million versus Q1. During the second quarter, Disney+ core subscribers grew modestly, with over 600,000 net additions. Core international subs, increased by close to $1 million. While domestic subs declined slightly in the quarter from continued impacts from the price increase, domestic ARPU increased sequentially by 20%, reflecting strong subscription revenue growth. And while the softness we saw in Q2 domestic Disney+ net ads may linger into Q3, we do expect core sub growth to rebound in Q4. At ESPN Plus and Hulu, subscribers increased slightly over the prior quarter. ARPU at Hulu was impacted by lower per-subscriber advertising revenue, in line with the comments we made last quarter regarding near-term softness in the addressable advertising space. DTC expenses, including programming and production costs, and SG&A, declined in the second quarter versus Q1. Our direct-to-consumer operating results in Q2 outperformed our guidance by about $200 million, due in part to timing shifts of marketing expenses driven by recent slate changes at Disney+ and Hulu. The shift of some of those costs into the third quarter will contribute to Q3 DTC operating losses widening by approximately $100 million versus Q2. As we have noted before, the path will not be linear, as the strategic changes and improvements we're executing on take time to deliver, but we remain confident in our long-term trajectory, with continued opportunities to further improve results given our content duration strategy, planned price increases, expanding our relationships with our advertisers, and our on-going disciplined approach to costs. At Content Sales Licensing and Other, we generated a $50 million loss in the quarter, a bit shy of our prior guidance that results would be roughly break-even. Lower results in the second quarter versus the prior year were due to a decrease in TVS mod distribution results, partially offset by improved theatrical distribution results due to the continued success of Avatar, The Way of Water. In the fiscal third quarter, we anticipate this business's operating results will decline by $150 million to $200 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by timing of the marketing of theatrical releases, with key titles, Elemental, In Indiana Jones, and The Dial of Destiny, not premiering until very late in the quarter. Moving on to Parks, Experiences, and Products, operating income increased by over 20% versus the prior year to $2.2 billion, with increases at both international and domestic parks and experiences partially offset by lower merchandise licensing results at consumer products. Our international parks were a bright spot this quarter, with strong year-over-year operating income growth driven by higher attendance and improved financial results at Shanghai Disney Resort, Disneyland Paris, and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. At domestic parks and experiences, operating income increased 10% versus the prior year, driven primarily by the continued post-pandemic recovery of our cruise line, partially offset by a comparison to a gain from a real estate sale in the prior year. Q2 domestic parks operating income came in slightly below the prior year, but was still up over 50% versus 2019. Results generally reflects the cost pressures we cited in last quarter's earnings call, including wage increases, costs associated with new guest offerings, and other inflationary cost impacts. Domestic year-over-year increases in attendance and per capita spending were 7% and 2%, respectively. Per-cap growth was more moderate this quarter, as we are comparing against the first full quarter of offering GeniePlus and Lightning Lane at both parks in the prior year. Domestic parks and experiences operating margins were comparable to the prior year, once adjusted for the impact of the prior year's real estate sale. Please keep in mind that in the back half of this fiscal year, there will be an unfavorable comparison against the prior year's incredibly successful 50th anniversary celebration at Walt Disney World. We typically see some moderation in demand as we lapse these types of events, and third quarter-to-date performance has been in line with those historical trends. This comparison, coupled with inflationary cost pressures, including from a new union agreement, is expected to drive a modest adverse impact to domestic parks and experiences operating margins in the third quarter compared to the prior year. However, we expect the contribution from continued strong performance at our international parks in Q3 to result in DPEP segment-level operating margins that are slightly higher than the prior year. DPEP will continue to be a growth business for our company, and we will manage all of these factors in line with our enduring focus on our guests. Before we conclude, I would like to note a couple of items related to our expectations for the total company this year. For fiscal 2023, cash content spend company-wide is expected to remain roughly comparable to last year, excluding any potential impacts from the writer strike, and we expect that fiscal 2023 capital expenditures will total approximately $5.6 billion. This is lower than our prior guide of $6 billion, largely due to timing of projects at DPEP as well as lower technology spend at DMED. We still expect fiscal 2023 revenue and operating income to grow in the high single-digit percentage range. There are still many moving pieces, including macroeconomic factors, the state of the global advertising market, and content timing shifts, which could impact our plans and expectations for the back half of this year. But as Bob mentioned earlier, we are incredibly optimistic about the long-term value creation opportunities that the changes we are currently executing on can generate for our company, and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. And with that, I will turn the call over to Alexia for Q&A.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thanks, Christine. As we transition to Q&A, we ask you to please try to limit yourselves to one question in order to help us get as many answers as possible today. And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you. Good afternoon. Bob, I wanted to ask you about what you learned on sort of two topics over the last several months. One is around the price increase on Disney+. You've sort of commented that you think it went well. Obviously, we can see the subscriber trends. And you sound optimistic that the company can continue to drive ARPU over time. Maybe you just talk a little bit about what you've seen in the customer base and reaction and engagement that gives you confidence around pricing power for Disney+ looking ahead. And then a similar question around the cost rationalization and reorg at the company, now that you're sort of deep into that. What have you learned about the opportunity for that to drive better financial results for the company? And Christine sort of teased it, that there might be more opportunities to maybe exceed expectations. But do you think there's more to do, I guess, is the short question on the cost side. Thank you very much.\nRobert Iger: Thanks, Ben. On the first question regarding price increases, first, we were pleasantly surprised that the loss of subs due to what was a substantial increase in pricing for the non-ad supported Disney+ product was de minimis. It was some loss, but it was relatively small. That leads us to believe that we, in fact, have pricing elasticity. With that in mind, I think one of the things that we not only have discovered, but that we believe we have to do, is that we've got to widen the delta between the ad-free service and the non-ad supported service. Because we clearly would like to drive more subs to the ad-supported service, which we did in the quarter, by the way, the obvious reason, because of the ARPU potential of the ad service Disney+. And in fact, as we look to this up front and after careful and considerable discussion with our sales team, led by Rita Farrow, we see that there's going to be a substantial growth in digital advertising in this up front, I mean, quite substantial. Suggesting, for the obvious reason, because digital advertising is so attractive to advertisers, that there's an opportunity for us to really lean into ad-supported. And again, raising our prices on the ad-free, keeping the prices on the ad-supported relatively modest, maybe perhaps no increases, increasing the delta, driving more subs in a higher ARPU direction. So we're heartened by it, and we are optimistic. And that is one of the strategies that we believe will help lead us ultimately to profitability and growth, along with the second thing that you mentioned, which is the cost rationalization. And I'll tag team with Christine on this. Clearly, we, as she mentioned, we're on a path to meeting or exceeding $5.5 billion in growth, sorry, in cost reductions that we mentioned last quarter. That comes in two categories, content spend and SG&A. I'm going to let Christine handle the SG&A. But on the content spend, we said at the time, most of that will come starting in 2024 and into 2025, because we were committed to so much content already in 2023. I'll let Christine handle the timing of the SG&A reductions and what potential impact that would have. Clearly, again, the price increases, the pushing more viewers, sorry, more subscribers to the ad-supported, and the cost containment are among the things we are doing to get to profitability.\nChristine McCarthy: Yes. Hi, Ben. I'll just further elaborate on some of the SG&A progress that we've had. And thanks for picking up that I did tease that by saying that we would need to exceed our targets of $2.5 billion. But, as we've gotten into this, there's been great cooperation throughout the entire company, which has been really rewarding, because we're looking at this and, of course, there's the reality of headcount reductions, and we're going through those. But there's also other things that we're finding more and more opportunities on eliminating redundancies, looking at ways to become more effective by utilizing resources, people and other resources across other businesses. But we're really leaning into all the opportunities. There's technology, which we've also seen a lot of good progress. Some of it will be, and I say some, will be realized in the balance of this year, really at the end of the fiscal year. But the real impact is going to help us in 2024. But, once again, since we're all into it, I think, once again, having it be company-wide and having, it be something that all of our business leaders have embraced, we are looking for a real comprehensive look throughout the SG&A buckets.\nRobert Iger: And one more thing to add to that, Ben. We launched Disney+ in many, many markets around the world, including many very low ARPU markets. And not only did we launch in those markets, but we spent a lot of money on marketing in those markets, and we spent money on local content. So, as we rationalize this business and we head in the direction of profitability, clearly, we're looking at opportunities to reduce expenses in those markets where the revenue potential just isn't there.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Thank you both.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPhilip Cusick: Hi. Great to see the park's doing so well. Christine, can you dig into the contribution from Shanghai and where that is relative pre-COVID and to its potential? And Bob, Florida is such a big part of the value of the company, but you have this political issue that only seems to get more press. It seems like you're stuck with this fight. So, how should investors think about the risk, both the near-term and long-term business for Disney? Thank you.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, Phil. Yes, let me address our results at Shanghai. They were incredibly positive this quarter. We've been really gratified to see the bounce back from the pandemic closures that we had. We're not going to get into too many specifics, but suffice it to say that the business is doing extremely well on both an attendance and a per-cap basis. We see that momentum continuing, and we also have some new attractions. We've talked about Zootopia coming later this year, and we believe that that is going to drive even further attendance and spending at the park. But Shanghai is doing extremely well, and we've been really gratified to see that bounce back. Like I said, it was closed for quite a long period of time during the pandemic.\nRobert Iger: Regarding Florida, I got a few things I want to say about that, Phil. First of all, I think the case that we filed last month made our position in the facts very clear, and that's really that this is about one thing and one thing only, and that's retaliating against us for taking a position about pending legislation. And we believe that in us taking that position, we are merely exercising our right to free speech. Also, this is not about special privileges or a level playing field or Disney in any way using its leverage around the state of Florida. But since there's been a lot said about special districts and the arrangement that we had, I want to set the record straight on that, too. There are about 2,000 special districts in Florida, and most were established to foster investment and development, where we were one of them. It basically made it easier for us and others, by the way, to do business in Florida, and we built a business that employs, as we've said before, over 75,000 people and attracts tens of millions of people to the state. So while it's easy to say that the Reedy Creek Special District that was established for us over 50 years ago benefited us, it's misleading to not also consider how much Disney benefited the state of Florida. And we're also, we're not the only company operating a special district. I mentioned 2000, the Daytona Speedway has one, so do the Villages, which is a prominent retirement community, and there are countless others. So the goal here is leveling the playing, if the goal is leveling the playing field, then a uniform application of the law or government oversight of special districts needs to occur or be applied to all special districts. There's also a false narrative that we've been fighting to protect tax breaks as part of this, but in fact, we're the largest taxpayer in central Florida, paying over 1.1 billion in state and local taxes last year alone, and we pay more taxes, specifically more real estate taxes, as a result of that special district. And we all know there was no concerted effort to do anything to dismantle what was once called Reedy Creek Special District until we spoke out on the legislation. So this is plainly a matter of retaliation while the rest of the Florida special districts continue operating basically as they were. And I think it's also important for us to say our primary goal has always been to be able to continue to do exactly what we've been doing there, which is investing in Florida. We're proud of the tourism industry that we created, and we want to continue delivering the best possible experience for guests going forward. We never wanted, and we certainly never expected, to be in the position of having to defend our business interests in federal court, particularly having such a terrific relationship with the state, as we've had for more than 50 years. And as I mentioned on our shareholder call, we have a huge opportunity to continue to invest in Florida. I noted that our plans were to invest $17 billion over the next ten years, which is what the state should want us to do. We operate responsibly, we pay our fair share of taxes, we employ thousands of people, and by the way, we pay them above the minimum wage, substantially above the minimum wage dictated by the state of Florida. And we also provide them with great benefits and free education. So I'm going to finish what is obviously kind of a long answer by asking one question. Does the state want us to invest more, employ more people, and pay more taxes, or not? Thanks.\nPhilip Cusick: Thanks, Bob.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. I have two. Bob, first for you is, what do you think the impact of the slowdown in your DTC content spending will have on global subscriber growth, and then what does the move to one app in the U.S. offer as a solution? And Christine, any help on future cash content spending? You said this year is flat. Is this the peak year, and then we start seeing declines from this year? Any help there on future cash content spending will be helpful. Thanks.\nRobert Iger: Michael, when we launch this service, let me remind everyone, it was only three and a half years ago, so we're still a startup in many ways. The goal was, as you know, global subs, and we wanted to flood the so-called digital shelves with as much content as possible. To achieve, obviously, as much sub growth as possible. And now, as we grow the business in terms of the global footprint, we realize that we made a lot of content that is not necessarily driving sub growth, and we're getting much more surgical about what it is we make. So, as we look to reduce content spend, we're looking to reduce it in a way that should not have any impact at all on subs. We believe that there's an opportunity for us to focus more on real sub drivers. And one interesting example and I should also throw marketing in, too, where when you make a lot of content, everything needs to be marketed. You're spending a lot of money marketing things that are not going to have an impact on the bottom line, except negatively, due to the marketing costs. One thing we also know is that our films, those that are released theatrically, big tentpole movies in particular, are great sub drivers. But we were spreading our marketing costs so thin that we were not allocating enough money to even market them when they came on the service, as witnessed by the ones that are coming up, including Avatar, Little Mermaid, Guardians of the Galaxy, Indiana Jones, Elemental, etcetera, where we actually believe we have an opportunity to lean into those more, put the right marketing dollars against it, allocate more from basically away from programming that was not driving any subs at all. So, I guess this is part of the maturation process. As we grow into a business that we had never been in, we're learning a lot more about it. Specifically, we're learning a lot more about how our content behaves on the service, and what it is consumers want.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, Michael. I'll address your question on content spend. As you know, this is an area that Bob is spending a lot of time working with our creative teams on. But when you think about that $30 billion overall, and Bob's targeted an annualized saving in the $3 billion range, I just want to remind everyone that the sports component of that amount is now over 30%, just due to the contractual rate increases that we've had in our contract rights, our sports rights. The other thing is, in fiscal 2023, we said that we're going to be roughly comparable to last year. Remember, last year we came in slightly below $30 billion. And this estimate does not include any potential impacts from the writer's strike. We have not estimated that, because that's a new development, and we haven't really quantified what that would be, because we don't know how long it's going to last. But in general, what we're really doing is looking at a lower volume of content, as I mentioned in my comments. And Bob is, once again, going through all of the development slates, and really looking at not only our Disney-branded, but also a more curated approach to our general entertainment content.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich of BofA Securities. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. Bob, you mentioned that in the upfront, you will take a bigger share. You'll lean heavily into digital or AVOD. I'm just wondering, in the face of accelerating pay-to-view universe decline, is that enough to offset linear losses, or when will it be enough to offset linear losses and start to drive growth? And in the sub-universe decline thought, I'm just wondering if you can give us your thoughts on ESPN and how it transitions, or when it transitions to ESPN Plus.\nRobert Iger: I'll address the ESPN first. We haven't really changed our position regarding basically migrating ESPN's flagship service as a direct-to-consumer or streaming platform. We think there's an inevitability to that, but it's a huge decision for us to make, and we know that we've got to get it right, both in terms of pricing and timing. Obviously, that has not only a direct impact on the linear channels, but it will have an even greater impact on it if we were to do that. What we see going on in linear networks, as you know, I'm not saying anything that you don't know, is we're seeing both sub-declines and advertising weakness. And it's created worrisome circumstance for us, because it's obviously having such a negative impact on the economics of that business, and that's forcing us to take a look at the cost structure of those channels, which ultimately comes down, probably more than anything, to spending on programming. The decline in the business is, by the way, something that we predicted starting in 2015-16, which is why we got into the streaming business to begin with, but the declines that we're seeing put even more pressure on us to turn that streaming business into a profitable growth business for us, and that's why all of the steps that we're taking, both in terms of the organizational structure, the cost reductions, the marketing changes, the changes in how we program, the lean into advertising, we've also, by the way, Jessica, we've invested a fair amount in the technology needed to serve advertisers digitally much more effectively with automated sales functionality and delivering in a very, very granular way exactly what advertisers want. So we're very bullish about leaning into digital advertising. We're bullish about how we're positioned there. We're bullish about Disney+ and Hulu and that combination, by the way. We think that by making Hulu available as a one-app experience will increase our engagement and increase our opportunity in terms of serving digital ads and growing our advertising business. So all things are kind of connected, ESPN to the long-term health of the bundle, the growth and the need to grow streaming as a reaction to the deterioration of linear businesses and, of course, all the steps that we've been taking to get to profitability.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. Bob, on Hulu, the revenues of Hulu make it one of the biggest streaming businesses around, and it's also one of the oldest services around, but it doesn't seem to be profitable despite the scale. And it sounds like you've made up your mind on buying the rest of Hulu based on the announcement of the combination with Disney+. Does this combination allow you to change the cost structure of Hulu by maybe dropping content spending or the number of titles on Hulu and raising price because it's now a single service? So any color on your plans with Hulu would be much appreciated. And, Christine, on the parks, could you help us scale the impact of the recent wage increases in Florida and how that might impact the year? And, historically, the business has delivered mid-single digits for better revenue growth, and EBITDA grows faster than that. You now have a number of cruise ships, more attractions, higher price, but also higher costs. So could you help us think about the growth algorithm going forward more broadly? Thank you.\nRobert Iger: Kannan, as you know, we have a contractual arrangement with Comcast that will enable them to put their share of Hulu back to us in early 2024. Starting in early 2024, there's a, I guess, further right that we have to call their share from them. And it's not really been fully determined what will happen in that regard, except that as we look more and more at the growth or the future of our streaming business, and I mentioned at the first earnings call that I did after I came back that everything was on the table. And, in fact, everything was on the table. But I've now had another three months to really study this carefully and figure out what is the best path for us to grow this business. And it's clear that a combination of the content that is on Disney+ with general entertainment is a very positive, is a very strong combination. From a subscriber perspective, from a subscriber acquisition, subscriber retention perspective, and also from an advertiser's perspective. So where we are headed is for one experience that would have general entertainment and Disney+ content together for the reasons that I just described. How that ultimately unfolds is to some extent in the hands of Comcast and in the hands of basically a conversation or a negotiation that we have with them. I don't want to be in any way predictive in terms of when or how that ends up. I can say we've had some conversations with them already. They've been cordial and they're aimed at being constructive. But I can't tell you and I can't really say where they end up, only to say that there seems to be real value in having general entertainment combined with Disney+. And if ultimately Hulu is that solution, we're bullish about that.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, Kannan. Let me address your question on parks earnings growth and the outlook there. So I think the way I would phrase this is we do expect a really solid year overall for our domestic parks. That being said, we also expect increased costs. And we alluded to that in our first quarter earnings call. And they're really coming from a few areas most predominantly. One is wages with the new union contract coupled with inflationary trends. We do have some new guest offerings. So there's some incremental operating expenses that come along with those. And we also have the operational support for adding a fifth cruise ship to our cruise line fleet. I think you all know that we launched the Wish back last fall. So we continue to look at ways to address cost management. The team down there has done a great job throughout the pandemic and then coming out of the pandemic. But they utilize a variety of tactics to mitigate potential margin pressures and downside risk across the segments. And some of the levers that they can utilize to really address it are by looking at capacity in some of our new attractions, they increase the footprint or increase capacity so we can open up the valve a little bit more on attendance. And with some new attractions that are more based on newer IP, so that will get more people not only coming in but wanting to come in and enjoy the experience while they're there. And we also are really continuing to focus on meeting our customer needs there. But we think that, this is a growth business for us. We've said so in the past. And I do just want to give a call out to our cruise business. That business, as you know, was the most impacted. And we had talked about that, that was going to be the last business to come back from the closures during the pandemic. But that business has come back incredibly strongly over the last year, this fiscal year. And even looking out to the balance of our fiscal year, we're very encouraged by what we're seeing there and the reception to not only our new ship but also our legacy ships within the fleet.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Morris of Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nMichael Morris: Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask one on direct-to-consumer advertising. And I'd love to hear any early details you can share about the Disney+ with advertising product. It wasn't mentioned as a driver, and I realize it's early. But I would love to hear any early takes there and thoughts about how that might pace over the course of the year. And then second, Bob, I'd love to ask about artificial intelligence, clearly a very hot topic right now, and a technology that seems like it could be pretty impactful to your business, both your ability to use it but also just given how much intellectual property you have to protect something that could be a threat as well. So I'd love any takes that you can share on how that would impact the business over time. Thank you.\nRobert Iger: Not to get cheeky, Michael, I'm looking forward to a time where maybe AI does earnings calls for me. You probably wouldn't know the difference, perhaps. Maybe they'd be better. I don't know.\nMichael Morris: I'd use AI to ask the questions, too.\nRobert Iger: It's pretty clear that AI developments represent some pretty interesting opportunities for us and some substantial benefits. In fact, we're already starting to use AI to create some efficiencies and ultimately to better serve consumers. Getting closer to the customer is something that is a real goal of ours, and we think that AI will provide some great opportunities to do that. But it's also clear that AI is going to be highly disruptive, and it could be extremely difficult to manage, particularly from an IP management perspective. I can tell you that our legal team is working overtime already to try to come to grips with what could be some of the challenges here, and we're certainly not the only ones. I think this is across not only our industry but industries. So I'd have to say overall I'm bullish about the prospects because I think they'll create efficiencies and ways for us to basically provide better services to customers. On the other hand, I think that there's a lot we're going to have to contend with that will be quite disruptive and quite challenging. Getting more specific is not something I really am prepared to do right now.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, Mike. I will take the Disney+ ad tier question for you. As you know, we launched back in December, and we've just begun to scratch the surface of what we can really do on advertising on Disney+. And we look at this as an incredible opportunity for longer-term advertising positioning. Just to remind everyone, we do have a lighter ad load on Disney+ versus what we have on Hulu and also notwithstanding the very challenging macroeconomic advertising market, we're still seeing our consumers come into the not only existing but also new sign-ups come into that ad tier, so we're very encouraged by that. As Bob has mentioned previously, we have invested a lot in our ad tier technology and our data platforms for really providing state-of-the-art programmatic and addressable ad tools to our advertisers, so those are also investments that we've made and we believe are going to pay off not only today but position us well for the future as the ad market overall gets stronger. The other thing I just want to mention is we will be launching the ad tier on Disney+ in Europe by the end of this calendar year, so that will be another platform that we'll have or another offering that we'll have for consumers outside of the U.S.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: The last question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nOperator:\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. Just struck me on good afternoon. Bob, integrating Hulu into the Disney+ app is intriguing, so I wanted to continue that conversation. When Disney+ was launched you noted consumers should not have to buy through your entertainment content to get to Marvel and Star Wars and Disney and Pixar content, and you thought at the time having separate services to give consumers choice was the right approach. Is that still the right approach to have multiple services to give consumer choice? And if the answer is yes but you want the efficiency and flexibility of a single app, that would suggest that Disney+ is finally turning into a platform, and I'm just curious if you see the opportunity to broaden the number of subscriptions that can live on that Disney+ platform or if you can expand the monetization of that platform in other ways while maintaining a premium experience for consumers. And if I could just add one for Christine. Is fiscal 3Q the peak for streaming losses? Thank you both.\nRobert Iger: We -- on the integrated app experience that we announced today, that's for consumers that have subscribed to both services for now. So in other words, it's taking what we call the dual bundle and putting it together in one experience, which is obviously good for consumers. Why have to close out one app and open another one? So it becomes a one app experience. We also think that it will benefit basically consumption in general, lower churn, be more attractive. It's just an all-in-one. It's a bigger platform, basically more content than it offered before. Outside the United States, we created that with Star, which doesn't have all the programming of Hulu, but it has a significant amount and it's working quite well. And it's one of the reasons why we're going to launch that as an advertised supported platform, as Christine mentioned. So I think to answer your question, we're bullish about an app that goes well beyond the Disney+ branded content and includes general entertainment, which maybe at one point I called undifferentiated. That was a little harsh. But that includes quality curated general entertainment for the purpose of growing advertising, growing subscriber fees, growing engagement, growing lessening churn, and to address one part of your question, reducing costs.\nChristine McCarthy: Hi, Doug. And I'll answer your question on the direct-to-consumer losses and the peak losses. Just to remind everyone, we did say, and it is the case, that we had peak losses in direct-to-consumer in the fourth quarter of 2022. That was the quarter that we reported in November. So what you've seen since then is we improved on a sequential, linked-quarter basis. You've seen a $400 million improvement in Q1, another $400 million improvement in Q2. In my comments, I did say that Q3, it would widen out by $100 million because of the timing of some releases and particularly the marketing of those releases. But that will be an aberration because it's not a linear path, but we will be improving significantly from 22 peak losses in Q4 through the balance of fiscal 2023. So, you should assume that what you saw back in Q4 was the peak loss and we have improved for the next two quarters, there will be that one little blip in Q3 and then we expect to be back on the path for the balance of the fiscal year.\nDoug Mitchelson: Very helpful.\nChristine McCarthy: Thanks.\nAlexia Quadrani: Okay, thanks for the question.

[Operator Instructions] Please note today\u2019s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Alexia Quadrani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani: Good afternoon. It\u2019s my pleasure to welcome everybody to the Walt Disney Company\u2019s first quarter 2023 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today\u2019s call is being webcast and a replay and transcript will also be made available on our website. Joining me for today\u2019s call are Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we will be happy to take some of your questions. We have a lot to get through today, but we will do our best to answer as many questions as we can. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nBob Iger: Thank you, Alexia and good afternoon everyone. It\u2019s an extraordinary privilege to lead this remarkable company again, especially at the special moment in its history as we celebrate our centenary. Since I first became CEO in 2005, I have guided the Walt Disney Company through two significant transformations. The first was to confer greater creative control and authority to our creative businesses and to focus on great brands and franchises. It was also aimed at embracing new technologies and expanding internationally. It ultimately led to the acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm. Second transformation took place beginning in 2016 when we laid the foundation for Disney to become a true digital company. As we were planning to launch our streaming platforms, the opportunity arose to acquire numerous assets from 21st Century Fox. And that acquisition gave us a bigger library with more franchises, a broader global reach and a talented experienced management team that enabled us to generate even more higher quality content. In 2019, Disney+ launched with nearly 500 films and 7,500 episodes of television from across the world of Disney. Three years later, its meteoric rise is considered one of the most successful rollouts in the history of the media business. Now it\u2019s time for another transformation, one that rationalizes our enviable streaming business and puts it on a path to sustained growth and profitability while also reducing expenses to improve margins and returns and better positioning us to weather future disruption, increased competition, and global economic challenges. We must also return creativity to the center of the company, increase accountability, improve results and ensure the quality of our content and experiences. Now the details. Our company is fueled by storytelling and creativity. And virtually every dollar we earn, every transaction, every interaction with our consumers emanates from something creative. I have always believed that the best way to spur great creativity is to make sure that people who are managing the creative processes feel empowered. Therefore, our new structure is aimed at returning greater authority to our creative leaders and making them accountable for how their content performs financially. Our former structure severed that link and it must be restored. Moving forward, our creative teams will determine what content we are making, how it is distributed and monetized and how it gets marketed. Managing costs, maximizing revenue and driving growth from the content being produced will be their responsibility. Under our strategic reorganization there will be three core business segments: Disney Entertainment, ESPN and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. Alan Bergman and Dana Walden will be Co-Chairman of Disney Entertainment, which will include the company\u2019s full portfolio of entertainment media and content businesses globally, including streaming. Jimmy Pitaro will continue to serve as Chairman of ESPN, which will include ESPN Networks, ESPN+ and our international sports channels. And Josh D\u2019Amaro will continue to be Chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, which will include our theme parks, resort destinations and cruise line as well as Disney\u2019s consumer products, games and publishing businesses. These organizational changes will be implemented immediately and we will begin reporting under the new business structure by the end of the fiscal year. This reorganization will result in a more cost-effective, coordinated and streamlined approach to our operations and we are committed to running our businesses more efficiently, especially in a challenging economic environment. In that regard, we are targeting $5.5 billion of cost savings across the company. First, reductions to our non-content costs will total roughly $2.5 billion not adjusted for inflation. $1 billion in savings is already underway and Christine will provide more details. But in general, the savings will come from reductions in SG&A and other operating costs across the company. To help achieve this, we will be reducing our workforce by approximately 7,000 jobs. While this is necessary to address the challenges we are facing today, I do not make this decision lightly. I have enormous respect and appreciation for the talent and dedication of our employees worldwide and I am mindful of the personal impact of these changes. On the content side, we expect to deliver approximately $3 billion in savings over the next few years, excluding sports. Christine will be providing more details during the call. Turning to our streaming businesses, I am proud of what we have been able to achieve since the launch of Disney+ just 3 years ago. We are delivering more content with greater quality in more ways, in more places and to larger audiences. Like many of our peers, we will no longer be providing long-term subscriber guidance in order to move beyond an emphasis on short-term quarterly metrics, although we will provide color on relevant drivers. Instead, our priority is the enduring growth and profitability of our streaming business. Our current forecasts indicate Disney+ will hit profitability by the end of fiscal 2024 and achieving that remains our goal. Since my return, I have drilled down into every facet of the streaming business to determine how to achieve both profitability and growth. And so with that goal in mind, we will focus even more on our core brands and franchises, which have consistently delivered higher returns. We will aggressively curate our general entertainment content. We will reassess all markets we have launched in and also determine the right balance between global and local content. We will adjust our pricing strategy, including a full examination of our promotional strategies. We will fine-tune our advertising initiatives on all streaming platforms. We will improve our marketing, better balancing platform and program marketing while also leveraging our legacy distribution platforms for marketing and programming. This may include greater use of legacy distribution opportunities to increase revenue and more effectively amortize content investment. And as I said before, our new organizational structure will reestablish the direct link between content decisions and financial performance. This is one of the most important steps we can take to improve the economics of our streaming business. There is a lot to accomplish, but let me be clear. This is my number one priority. We are focused on the success of our streaming business and the return it generates for our shareholders long into the future. Before I turn this over to Christine, a few comments about the quarter. James Cameron\u2019s Avatar: The Way of Water, which was easily the most successful film of the quarter has become the fourth biggest film of all time globally with close to $2.2 billion earned at the box office to-date. The global popularity of this film will result in the creation of more opportunities for fans to engage with the franchise, which they have been doing at Walt Disney World\u2019s Pandora, the World of Avatar, as well as in theaters globally and on Disney+, where the first film has delivered very strong numbers. And today, I am thrilled to announce that we will be bringing an exciting Avatar experience to Disneyland. We will be sharing more details on that very soon. Avatar represents yet another core franchise for the company. And as you have seen time and time again, we have a unique way of leveraging creative success across multiple businesses and territories and over long periods of time. Speaking of our parks, we had an outstanding quarter in Q1, while we continued our purposeful efforts to control capacity to preserve guest experience. Last month, we also announced some price adjustments at our parks. We are listening to guest feedback and we are continuously working to improve the quality and value of their experience. We are also proud of our creative success as we led all studios with the most Academy Award nominations, including two best picture nominations, 20th Century Studio\u2019s Avatar: The Way of Water and Searchlight Pictures\u2019 The Banshees of Inisherin. Marvel\u2019s Black Panther: Wakanda Forever received five Oscar nominations. And in addition to an $840 million run at the box office, it launched on Disney+ last week and it has quickly become one of the most successful Marvel films on the platform. Looking ahead, we are excited about our fantastic lineup of new films coming to theaters this year, starting with next week\u2019s release of Marvel\u2019s Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania; followed by other highly anticipated theatrical titles, including The Little Mermaid; Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3; Pixar\u2019s Elemental; Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny; and Disney\u2019s Haunted Mansion. Lucasfilms\u2019 The Mandalorian, the series that started it all for Disney+, will be back at the beginning of March for its highly anticipated third season. And today, I am so pleased to announce that we have sequels in the works from our animation studios to some of our most popular franchises: Toy Story, Frozen and Zootopia. We will have more to share about these productions soon, but this is a great example of how we are leaning into our unrivaled brands and franchises. The Walt Disney Company also won more Golden Globes than any other entertainment company this year, a total of 9, including for Abbott Elementary, the first broadcast show to win a Golden Globe for Best Series in nearly a decade. Without question, we have a world class television business that fuels both our linear channels and direct-to-consumer services, especially with the assets acquired through the Fox transaction. It goes without saying that the best shows lead to the most lucrative library and have the power to endure because of their quality. The Simpsons illustrates this perfectly. Disney+ launched back in 2019 with more than 30 seasons and it remains one of our top performers today. Across the board, our television business is second to none, and that includes ABC News, which remains America\u2019s number one news network. Power of ESPN brand also continues to deliver for us. In calendar \u201822, ESPN linear ratings were up 8% overall and 14% in primetime and we are also growing rapidly across our digital platforms. We are being selective in our rights renewals and continue to approach rights acquisition with discipline and a focus on supporting both sides of ESPN\u2019s business: traditional linear and digital. ESPN is more than just a network. And today, the team is harnessing innovative technology to deliver spectacular coverage and entertainment to audiences who have a deep connection to the brand and content. Now when it comes to investing in growth and returning capital to shareholders, we will take a balanced and disciplined approach as we did throughout my previous tenure as CEO, when we invested in our core businesses and acquired new ones, bought back stock and paid a dividend to our shareholders. As a result of the impact of the COVID pandemic, we made the decision to suspend the dividend in the spring of 2020. Now that the pandemic impacts to our business are largely behind us, we intend to ask the Board to approve the reinstatement of a dividend by the end of the calendar year. Our cost-cutting initiatives will make this possible. And while initially, it will be a modest dividend, we hope to build upon it over time. Christine will provide more information on that. And finally, on the topic of succession, the Board recently established a dedicated Succession Planning Committee. The committee is chaired by Mark Parker, who will become Chairman of the Walt Disney Company\u2019s Board following our annual meeting. I am excited to work with him in his new capacity and I am grateful to our outgoing Board Chairman, Susan Arnold, for her 15 years of tremendous service. Obviously, there is a lot going on, but as I said before, I am truly excited to be back and to lead this great company through this necessary transformation. I am grateful for our incredible talent and my exceptional leadership team. And with that, I will turn things over to Christine.\nChristine McCarthy: Thank you, Bob. It\u2019s great to have you back on these calls and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, our company\u2019s diluted earnings per share for the first fiscal quarter of 2023 was $0.99, a decrease of $0.07 versus the prior year as continued strength at our Parks, Experiences and Products business was more than offset by a year-over-year decline at our Media Entertainment and Distribution segment. You heard earlier that we are embarking on a significant company-wide cost reduction plan that we expect will reduce annualized non-content-related expenses by roughly $2.5 billion, not including inflation. In general, we anticipate these reductions will be comprised of approximately 50% marketing, 30% labor and 20% technology, procurement and other expenses. Around $1 billion of this target was included in the guidance we gave last quarter. That fiscal 2023 segment operating income should grow in the high single-digit percentage range, which is still our current expectation. The bulk of the efficiencies we are realizing this year are related to reductions in marketing and headcount at DMED. The remaining portion of the target represents incremental SG&A and other operating expense savings, which will fully materialize by the end of fiscal 2024. Longer term, we also expect to realize additional efficiencies in our content spending with an annualized savings target of approximately $3 billion of future spending outside of sports. We will share additional details with you as we move forward on realizing these efficiencies. Bob also gave you some details earlier on the company\u2019s reorganization. The new structure and leadership roles are effective immediately and we expect to transition to financial reporting under this structure by the end of the fiscal year, at which point we will provide recast financials under our new segments. Until then, I will be walking through our results under the existing segments. Turning to Parks, Experiences and Products, we are thrilled with the results we achieved this quarter with operating income increasing 25% versus the prior year to over $3 billion, reflecting increases at our domestic and international parks and experiences businesses. At domestic parks and experiences, significant revenue and operating income growth in the quarter was achieved despite purposefully reducing capacity during select peak holiday periods by approximately 20% versus pre-pandemic levels in order to prioritize the guest experience. Per capita guest spend at our domestic parks also showed strong growth. Quarter-to-date, park attendance at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resort are pacing above prior year. And based on reservation bookings, we expect to see this trend continue. Disney Cruise Line was also a meaningful contributor to the year-over-year increase in domestic operating income, reflecting higher occupancy in the existing fleet as well as the Disney Wish, which generated positive operating income in its first full quarter of operations. Domestic parks and experiences operating margins improved versus the prior year despite increased cost from inflation, operation support and new guest offerings, pressures, which we expect will persist into Q2 and beyond. At international parks and experiences, higher year-over-year results were due to growth at Disneyland Paris and higher royalty revenue from Tokyo Disney Resort, partially offset by a decrease at Shanghai Disney Resort. At Disneyland Paris, we remain pleased with the positive results we\u2019re seeing from the substantial investments we\u2019ve made. And at Shanghai, results reflect the fact that the resort was closed for roughly a month during Q1 of fiscal 2023. Moving on to our Media and Entertainment Distribution segment, operating income in the first quarter decreased by over $800 million versus the prior year, driven by year-over-year declines across direct-to-consumer, linear networks and content sales, licensing and others. However, we delivered a significant improvement on a quarter-over-quarter basis at our direct-to-consumer business as we progress on our path towards profitability with Q1 operating losses improving sequentially by over $400 million from Q4. The sequential improvement at DTC was driven by higher revenue and lower SG&A costs, partially offset by higher programming and production costs. Notably, in the first quarter, we meaningfully reduced DTC marketing expenses across all three categories: content, brand and performance. At both ESPN+ and Hulu, subscribers and ARPU grew sequentially with ARPU growth reflecting the impact of price increases that occurred in August and October, respectively. And at Disney+, core subscribers increased slightly, in line with our prior guidance from $102.9 million in the fourth quarter to $104.3 million in Q1. Disney+ core ARPU decreased by $0.19 versus the prior quarter, driven by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact and a higher mix of subscribers to our multiproduct offerings, partially offset by a benefit from the recent domestic price increase, which occurred towards the end of the first fiscal quarter. There are a few factors worth mentioning that we expect will impact Disney+ core subscriber and ARPU growth in Q2. The Disney+ domestic price increase has been playing out as expected, with only modestly higher churn, which may also negatively impact the fiscal second quarter given the timing of the December price increase. That impact, in addition to slower than previously expected growth in some international markets, suggests core Disney+ subs may grow only modestly in Q2 at a similar pace to the first quarter. As we have said before, sub growth will vary quarter-to-quarter, and we expect to see higher core subscriber growth towards the end of the fiscal year. Disney+ core ARPU will continue to benefit in the second quarter from the domestic price increase. And while it\u2019s only been 2 months since the launch of the Disney+ ad tier, we are pleased with the initial response, which includes continued demand from top-tier advertisers. As I mentioned last quarter, we do not expect the launch of the Disney+ ad tier to provide a meaningful financial impact until later this fiscal year. And like Bob said, we are reaffirming our guidance that Disney+ will achieve profitability by the end of fiscal 2024. Although, as I have mentioned before, our expectations are built on certain assumptions around subscriber additions based on the attractiveness of our future content, churn expectations, the financial impact of the Disney+ ad tier and price increases, our ability to quickly execute on cost rationalization while preserving revenue and macroeconomic conditions, all of which, while based on extensive internal analysis as well as recent experience provide a layer of uncertainty in our outlook. We remain focused on showing incremental improvements in our DTC metrics, and we will continue to provide transparency into our progress and key drivers. In our prior earnings call, we noted that we expected the improvement in Q2 operating results at direct-to-consumer would be larger than the improvement in Q1. We now expect Q2 DTC operating results to improve sequentially by approximately $200 million as improvements in the first quarter materialized more quickly than previously expected. Additionally, our view on Q2 now incorporates more challenging addressable advertising headwinds. Moving on to linear networks, first quarter operating income decreased by approximately $240 million versus the prior year. Domestic channels operating income grew year-over-year but that growth was more than offset by decreases at international channels. The increase at domestic channels was due to higher results at cable, while broadcasting results were comparable to the prior year quarter. Higher cable results were driven by lower programming and production costs, partially offset by decreases in advertising and affiliate revenue. The decrease in programming and production costs reflect lower NFL and college football playoff or CFP rights costs. The decline in NFL rights expense reflects the timing of costs under our new agreement compared to the prior NFL agreement, and lower CFP rights costs were due to timing shifts. Recall that we had two fewer games in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 versus the prior year as those games were shifted into Q2 this year. The decrease in cable advertising revenue also reflects the CFP timing shift. ESPN advertising revenue in the first quarter was down 4% year-over-year, but was roughly flat once adjusted for the CFP shift. And quarter-to-date, domestic cash ad sales at ESPN are pacing slightly below prior year when the two additional CFP games are adjusted out. Scatter/Data pricing remains above upfront levels. Although it has softened a bit in recent months, however, we are seeing solid advertiser interest for live events such as the Oscars and demand across sports also remains solid. Total domestic affiliate revenue in the first quarter increased by 1% from the prior year, driven by 6 points of growth from contractual rate increases, partially offset by a 5-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. International channels operating income decreased versus the prior year due to lower advertising revenue and unfavorable foreign exchange impact and a decrease in affiliate revenue, partially offset by a decrease in programming and production costs. As a reminder, the first quarter held no IPL cricket matches versus 13 matches in the prior year due to COVID-related timing shifts. Looking ahead to the fiscal second quarter, we expect Linear Networks operating income will decrease year-over-year by approximately $1 billion. We expect Q2 will have the most challenging comparison for Linear Networks versus the prior year and anticipate a significantly lower decline in the back half of the year. There are several factors impacting the Q2 guide that I\u2019d like to walk through. First, recall that domestic Linear Networks operating income increased in Q1 versus the prior year, benefiting from the timing of costs under a new agreement for the NFL and a timing impact for CFP. These impacts will work against us in Q2. And as a result, ESPN is expected to account for approximately half of the $1 billion operating income decrease. Broadcasting and our other domestic cable networks will be adversely impacted in the second quarter by approximately $300 million, driven primarily by headwinds in advertising, and to a lesser extent, affiliate revenue, and international channels account for the remaining $200 million decrease. This includes timing impacts from BCCI cricket with eight additional matches versus the prior year, other contractual rights cost increases and additional top line headwinds. And at content sales, licensing and other operating results decreased versus the prior year by $114 million as higher theatrical results were more than offset by lower TV/SVOD operating income, higher overhead costs and a decrease in home entertainment operating income. These results came in below the guidance we gave in November, primarily due to softer-than-expected performance of certain theatrical releases. In the second quarter, we believe that content sales, licensing and other operating results will be roughly breakeven. Finally, before we conclude, I\u2019d like to say a few words about our focus on allocating capital in a disciplined and balanced way. As Bob mentioned, over the years, we have invested in our businesses to drive growth and return meaningful capital to our shareholders. Despite the impact of COVID, which had a significant adverse impact on the company\u2019s free cash flow, our balance sheet is strong and supports ongoing investment in our businesses. We still expect cash content spend company-wide to remain in the low $30 billion range for fiscal 2023. The longer-term content cost reductions referenced earlier in the call are not expected to impact this year\u2019s guidance range. We also continue to invest in our parks and experiences globally and in other capital ticks across the enterprise and expect that fiscal 2023 capital expenditures will total approximately $6 billion. This is lower than our prior guide of $6.7 billion primarily due to decreases in CapEx on our domestic parks, reflecting, in part, some timing shifts. Like Bob mentioned, given our recovery from the pandemic, strong balance sheet and commitment to cost cutting, we believe we will be on track to declare a modest dividend by the end of this calendar year. The amount will likely be a small fraction of our pre-COVID dividend with the intention to increase it over time as our earnings power grows. And in terms of our current outlook, as we sit here today, \u2013 we still expect that revenue and segment operating income growth for this fiscal year will be in the high single-digit percentage range, and we look forward to updating you on our progress as we move forward. I\u2019d also like to note that shortly after today\u2019s call we will be posting a presentation on our Investor Relations website, which will summarize many of the themes that we are discussing here today. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Alexia, and we would be happy to take your questions.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thanks, Christine. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s first question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with BofA Securities. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you so much. Hi, Bob, as Christine said, it\u2019s great to have you back. It seems like a very different company than when you left even though it was only a couple of years ago, given the cyclical, but maybe more importantly, the secular challenges across all of your businesses, Linear Film, content competition, etcetera. So in the restructuring \u2013 what do you think are the quick fixes and what will take longer term to see the benefits of some of these actions? And on the $3 billion in cost cuts in content, is that largely fewer titles? And what does it mean for ultimate direct-to-consumer margins?\nBob Iger: Jessica, thank you for welcoming me back. Let me take the second part of your question first. We are going to take a really hard look at the cost for everything that we make, both across television and film because things in a very competitive world have just simply gotten more expensive. And that\u2019s something that is already underway here. In addition, we\u2019re going to look at the volume of what we make. And with that in mind, we\u2019re going to be fairly aggressive at better curation when it comes to general entertainment because when you think about it, general entertainment is generally undifferentiated as opposed to our core franchises and our brands which because of their differentiation and their quality have delivered higher returns for us over the years. So we think we have an opportunity to, through more aggressive curation, to reduce some of our costs in the general entertainment side and in general, in volume. In addition, the structure is now designed to place responsibility of all international programming and investment in content in the hands of one unit so that they can better decide the balance between what we make for global distribution and consumption and what we make for local distribution and consumption with an eye toward possibly reducing expenses there as well as we balance better. Obviously, all designed to deliver the profitability that we talk about delivering by the end of \u201824. In terms of your first question, I mean, indeed, it is times have changed, although in retrospect, looking back at it, not in an extraordinary way. Obviously, it\u2019s gotten more competitive. The forces of disruption have only gotten greater. And there are certain things, certainly, as a residual of COVID, they have just gotten tougher from a macroeconomic perspective. That said, we\u2019re still a company that is focused on creativity at its highest form. I love the fact that we are relinking the creative side of our business with the distribution and the monetization side of our business. And I think by doing that, we will see the impact of that reorganization fairly quickly. But when I think about the secular change that we\u2019re going through, generally speaking, I like our hand. We have an ability to balance how we take our product to market with legacy platforms, whether it\u2019s movie theaters or multichannel TV with, of course, the streamers. We have \u2013 and by the way, that helps us in a number of fronts, including advertising, monetization, stronger marketing. And so, I think that when you focus on the company\u2019s assets, in terms of our brands and our franchises. Yes, it\u2019s a tough environment, but the combination of the restructuring and the fact that we\u2019ve got these core brands, which when we get right creatively as we\u2019ve seen time and time again, not only differentiates us, but enables us to deliver fairly strong returns.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you. Good afternoon. Bob, I\u2019m sure one reaction you\u2019ll get today from all this news is the future of television, I think is viewed as being streamed with linear obviously declining. I\u2019m sure you generally agree with that trend. So how do you think about that about your strategy as you\u2019ve laid out today in the context of that to make sure you\u2019re maximizing the returns globally of the franchises that you\u2019ve built? And then I was just wondering, maybe, Christine, on the Parks business, really strong margins this quarter, really kind of the return to the kind of incremental margins we\u2019re used to seeing, didn\u2019t sound like there was anything one-time. I just wanted to ask if this quarter is sort of emblematic of kind of how you see the rest of the year playing out from a trend point of view? Thank you, both.\nBob Iger: Thanks, Ben. Nice to hear from you. I\u2019ve been watching this very carefully for a long time. And what I\u2019m talking about is the impact of technology is basically creating a huge authority shift from the producer and the distributor to the consumer. And as that authority has shifted, it\u2019s made the traditional business more complicated, more to more challenging. And when you think about what streaming is, and we talked about this a lot as it related to multichannel TV, it is the ultimate ala card proposition for the consumer. It gives the consumer so much more authority than they ever had before because in reality, it gives them the ability to watch programs, not channels, not even bundles when you think about it. And because you are signing up in most cases for a 1-month subscription, you can sign up for one program, pay a relatively small amount of money and then end up basically unsubscribing. That\u2019s tremendous change. And I think what\u2019s going on right now is that as the linear business continues to erode, we have been basically eyes wide open on that. Christine commented about some of the challenges related to that, the streaming business, which I believe is the future and has been growing is not delivering basically the kind of profitability or bottom line results that the linear business delivered for us over a few decades. And so we are in a very interesting transition period, but one I think is inevitably heading towards streaming. So, what we are \u2013 the way we are basically contending with it, we have alluded to it today already is that \u2013 and this, I think is also directly related to our restructuring. We are going to rebalance a bit because those linear channels and movie theaters too still can provide us with significant amount of monetization capability. They enable us to amortize the cost better over multiple platforms and create some marketing cloud. When you think about it, Abbott Elementary airs on ABC, then it goes to Hulu. The demographic difference in age is tremendous. It\u2019s like 60-years-old or around, estimating on ABC and then the 30s on Hulu. That\u2019s a perfect example how the linear platforms, while they still have an audience and could help us monetize can still be used effectively, and we have that ability. And so we are going to monitor it very carefully. We are not in any way stepping away from streaming. It remains our number one priority. It is in many respects, our future. But we are not going to abandon the linear or the traditional platforms while they can still be a benefit to us and our shareholders.\nChristine McCarthy: So, Ben, great to hear your voice, and I will address the parks question. So, as I mentioned in my comments, we were really thrilled with the performance of parks in the quarter. There were no one-time items to call out. But the one thing I would mention is in previous quarters, we had mentioned that the recovery from the pandemic and our international parks was lagging domestic. And in this quarter, we had very strong performance, especially year-over-year from Disneyland Paris. We had the opening of Avengers Campus over there in July, and that is incredibly popular in driving attendance. And we also have a new hotel that was actually an old hotel that was redone into the art of Marvel. Again, very popular and attracting a lot of consumers to come out and experience that. The other thing I mentioned was the strength at our royalty stream from Disneyland in Tokyo. And the other thing not to forget is, this quarter, our first quarter of the year is seasonally one of our strongest when you look at it relative to other quarters. But the year-over-year comparison, it was an improvement, and we feel great about our business going forward.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you both.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Michael Nathanson at SVB MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nathanson: Thanks. Welcome back, Bob. I have two. The first is, when you go back to the second investment day you had for streaming, the company increased their TAM forecast, their investment spending and kind of vision for Disney+. Now that you have returned with more data and time, what\u2019s the vision for Disney+? You don\u2019t want to give us long-term targets, I get that. But what is the product vision? Is it a more narrow vision, any type of long-term size of the investment and awesome profitability case of D+ will be helpful. And then on linear, to Ben\u2019s question, a big part of the cost structure of sports costs, you have signed a ton in lately. But when you think about going forward, can you help us understand what will change going forward on sports rights investment in terms of must-have and not necessarily must-have? Thanks.\nBob Iger: Well, the second question, as you know, we have locked in a number of deals already, including some of the biggest ones, which is in college football with the SEC as well as with the NFL, the one that\u2019s looming is the NBA. And I know that\u2019s on people\u2019s minds, which is a product that we have enjoyed having and hope to continue to enjoy having, because not only it\u2019s volume, but it\u2019s quality. ESPN has been selective in the rights that they bought. I have had long conversations about this with Jimmy Pitaro, and we have got some decisions that we have to make coming up, not on something \u2013 not on anything particularly large, but on a few things. And we are simply going to have to get more selective. ESPN+ actually has grown nicely for us, and it\u2019s shown us that the ESPN brand can be enjoyed and can be expressed well as a streaming brand. And I think that we are going to continue to look at that as a potential pivot for ESPN away from the linear business. But we are not going to do that precipitously. We are not going to do that until it really makes sense from an economic perspective. On the first part of your question, what either \u2013 what\u2019s changed or where we headed from what was the second Investor Day. I think a few things. First of all, we were as a company in a global arms race for subscribers. And it was \u2013 the number of subscribers that have become kind of the primary measurement of success not only here in the company, but among in the investment community. And in our zeal to go after subscribers, I think we might have gotten a bit too aggressive in terms of our promotion and we are going to take a look at that. I listed a number of things on the call. That\u2019s one of them. I talked about pricing as well. That\u2019s another where we really have to look at are we pricing correctly, it\u2019s interesting, as Christine noted. We took our pricing up substantially on Disney+, and we didn\u2019t suffer any de minimis. We only suffered a de minimis loss of subs. That tells us something. It may also tell us that the promotion to chase subs that we have been fairly aggressive at globally wasn\u2019t absolutely necessary. So, pricing is definitely one thing, promotion, obviously is tied to that. It\u2019s also obvious to us is we can\u2019t get the profitability and turn this into a growth business without growing subs. So, while we are taking off the table sub-guidance, we are still going to look to grow subs. We just want to grow quality subs that are loyal and where we actually have an ability to continue to price effectively to those subs. In addition, we are going to lean more into our franchises, our core franchises and our brands. I talked about curation and general entertainment. We have to be better at curating the Disney and the Pixar and the Marvel and the Star Wars of it all as well. And of course, reduce costs on everything that we make because while we are extremely proud of what\u2019s on the screen, it\u2019s gotten to a point where it\u2019s extraordinarily expensive. And we want all the quality. We want the quality on the screen, but we have to look at what they cost us. So, we are going to continue to go after subs, but we are going to be more judicious about how we do that. We are going to look carefully at pricing. We are going to reduce costs, both in content and of course, infrastructure, there is a lot that we are getting out there. Marketing is another area where we are going to try to rebalance marketing of the platform versus marketing of the programs. Nielsen came out with something a few weeks ago that was stunning to us, and that was that 10 of the top 15 movies streamed in the United States in 2022 were ours. On that list was Moana and Zootopia and Frozen, but also Turning Red and Encanto. That suggests to us that our brands and franchises work extremely well in streaming. I mentioned how Wakanda Forever has done as well. So, core brands and franchises more efficient pricing, getting better in marketing, being a little bit more judicious at promotion, all of those things is how we believe we are going to get to turn the streaming business to a growth business. And one other thing, the streaming business is going to continue to grow, albeit at the expense of linear programming, but consumption of television is not decreasing, is actually going up.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPhilip Cusick: Hi. Thank you. Bob, following up on Michael, there has been a lot of talk in the last year about whether Disney should keep spin or trade ESPN, and it now as a standalone segment, can you give us your view on the future of Disney and sports in particular, and maybe TV in general? How integral is ESPN to the company\u2019s future? Thanks.\nBob Iger: Thank you, Phil. We are fairly certain that when we created the structure and broke ESPN out on its own that it would lead to questions like this. We did not do it for that purpose actually. ESPN is a differentiator for this company. It\u2019s the best sports brand in television. It\u2019s one of the best sports brand in sports. It continues to create real value for us. It is going through some, obviously, challenging times because of what\u2019s happened in linear programming. But the brand of ESPN is very healthy, and the programming of ESPN is very healthy. We just have to figure out how to monetize it in disrupting and a continuing or disrupting world. That\u2019s it. But we are not engaged in any conversations right now or considering a spin-off of ESPN. That had been done, by the way, in my absence. And I am told the company concluded after exploring it very carefully that it wasn\u2019t something the company wanted to do.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. Welcome Bob \u2013 my welcome back, Bob come in. Bob, there is some investor skepticism that theme park per caps and margins are elevated due to post-pandemic benefits that might expire. I am curious, in your view, does the theme park division still have healthy growth prospects from here, especially after a pretty good quarter, this quarter. And what do you see as the major growth drivers of theme parks going forward? Thanks.\nBob Iger: Nice to hear your voice again, Doug. We have been through many of these calls in the past. Well, the answer is yes on the theme parks in terms of their growth. I am very, very bullish about our parks and not just because of the COVID recovery. But to start with, demand on the parks is extraordinary right now. Now, we could lean into that demand easily by letting more people in and by more aggressively pricing. We don\u2019t think either would be smart, because we let more people in is going to reduce guest experience. That\u2019s certainly not what we want. And in fact, if you looked at our results this past holiday season, we actually reduced capacity certainly improved guest experience, and we are able to maintain profit, not just profitability, but a very, very successful or robust bottom line. We are going to continue to look at opportunities like that, which is essentially to simply get more creative in terms of managing the capacity that we have. I am going to come back to that in terms of growth, but let me also address the pricing side. It\u2019s clear that some of our pricing initiatives were alienating to consumers. I have always believed by the way, that accessibility is a core value of the Disney brand. We were not perceived to be as accessible or as affordable to many segments as we probably should have been. So, after basically paying heat to what we were hearing, we started to address it. And the steps that we took were actually were very, very positive. We got really great reaction to it. In addition, and it\u2019s tied to this is that we have put in place just basically more flexibility for the consumer in terms of how much it cost them to go. And interestingly enough, if you look at the increase of the core ticket, let\u2019s say, Disneyland, it has not really increased that much, maybe slightly ahead of inflation over the last few years. But one of the things that was interesting to me and coming in and examining our pricing is, we are making that available to people for only 15 days a year. So, if you look at our new pricing strategy, we made it available, I think was 50 days a year, so we greatly increased accessibility to our lowest price. And it is really well received. So, we are going to manage capacity very, very carefully. Some of that, by the way, has enabled us to essentially shift mix to \u2013 from annual pass holders to people who may come just once in a lifetime or once. They tend to be good customers of ours because of their per cap spending when they are there. That\u2019s really helpful. Some of the things that we put in place to manage basically annual pass holders was done to help us manage capacity without having doing too much damage to the bottom line. Lastly, we have learned that when we invest in increasing capacity, the Star Wars lands would be a good example of that, Pandora was a great example of that. We can grow our business. In fact, if you look at the results when we put Pandora and Animal Kingdom from year-to-year, they were stunning in terms of how many more people visited Animal Kingdom. I mentioned on the call that we are going to bring a version of Avatar to Disneyland. We have other opportunities as well. I have talked to Josh D\u2019Amaro about this very recently, like this morning, again, to really look at all the great franchises of the company and see where we can invest in them in the parks to increase capacity while preserving guest satisfaction.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thank you.\nAlexia Quadrani: Operator, I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nSteven Cahall: Thanks. Bob, I will ask you a question that we have asked Christine a lot over the last year, which is you made the comment about ESPN+ expressing some success in streaming and sports. And there is probably now about 40 million homes who have decided to not be in the bundle. So, what do you need to see out there in the linear world to decide that an ESPN ala carte sports service in streaming should be the big leap for Disney? And then just a small one, you mentioned about how a lot of content can amortize in places other than streaming. You had talked a lot today about cost cutting. Should we think about licensing as also being a potential sort of big profit pool over the next few years? Thank you.\nBob Iger: I will take the second part first, Steve. Yes. The answer to the second part is yes. Now, when you say big, I don\u2019t know yet. I mean we are not really there. But when we bought Fox we greatly enhanced our television production and film production capabilities, bringing into the company great talent in both the movie and the TV side. As I have talked about getting more aggressive at curating general entertainment. By the way, we are not getting out of that business, but we are going to curate it more. We have opportunities using the great talent that we have to create for third-parties, and we are going to look at that very seriously. I actually think there is a nice opportunity to create a growth business for the company, but it\u2019s way too soon to predict what that can be. Regarding ESPN and when we might make the shift, if you are asking me is the shift inevitable, the answer is yes. But I am not going to give you any sense of when that could be because we have to do it obviously at a time that really makes sense for the bottom line. And we are just not there yet. And that\u2019s not just about how many subscribers we could get. It\u2019s also about what is the pricing power of ESPN, which obviously ties to the menu of sports that they have licensed.\nSteven Cahall: Thank you.\nAlexia Quadrani: Okay. Thanks for the question.

Joining me this morning are Bob Iger, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following introductory remarks from Bob, we'll be happy to take your questions. So with that, I will now turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert Iger: Good morning. As I reflect on the two years since I returned to the company, I'm incredibly proud of how much progress we've made. We've emerged from a period of considerable challenges and disruption, and we are well positioned for growth. We put in place specific strategies to generate growth across our businesses, and our solid results this quarter are a clear indication they've been successful. Given the momentum we see, we believe we can continue to drive healthy growth beyond this year, including our expectation of high single-digit adjusted EPS growth in fiscal 2025, accelerating to double-digit adjusted EPS growth in fiscal 2026 and 2027. I'm especially grateful to my leadership team and everyone at Disney, who has played a role in setting us on this path for a new era of growth. On the creative front, our renewed strength is a result of the extensive work we began two years ago to restore creativity to the center of the company. In television, our branded series and general entertainment programming are performing exceptionally well, growing new audiences and winning an unprecedented number of accolades, including a record-breaking 60 Emmy Awards. In film, we are extremely proud of our performance at the summer box office, fueled by the top two movies of the year to date: Inside Out 2 and Deadpool & Wolverine. We are excited to close out the year with two other highly anticipated titles: Moana 2 and Mufasa: The Lion King. Looking to 2025, we have an extremely promising content slate, including Captain America: Brave New World, Lilo & Stitch, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, Zootopia 2 and Avatar: Fire and Ash. Worth noting that a successful Disney movie today drives more value than it ever has in the past with our increased number of consumer touch points extending the reach and impact of our world-class storytelling from streaming to parks and resorts, cruise ships, consumer products and games. This multiplier effect means that the system economics of our movie business has never been stronger. Disney's Experiences segment continues to be the gold standard for the industry. And we have an investment strategy that is highly targeted in terms of projects, locations and IP and is designed to drive operating income growth and attractive returns. This all comes at a time when the footprint of our parks and experiences is growing. With six locations that attract guests from across the world, we have multiple exciting expansions currently in the works. After we unveil the Disney Treasure next week, Disney Cruise Line's fleet will grow to a total of six ships with seven additional ships currently in development. Plus our collaboration with Epic Games will allow us to integrate our popular brands and franchises in a transformational new games and entertainment universe. Meanwhile, we ended the quarter with 174 million Disney+ Core and Hulu subscription. And in five short years, we've built Disney+ into a streaming destination unlike any other with more than 120 million core subscribers. And with the addition of Hulu on Disney+, it is the ultimate collection of high-quality content for every member of the household from our extensive library of branded and general entertainment titles to news and live events. We have invested to make our already profitable streaming business a significant growth driver for the company, and we are strengthening that streaming offering even more on December 4th, with the introduction of an ESPN tile on Disney+. This is the beginning of an exciting new era for ESPN. And we have secured rights to many of the most popular sports for years to come at a time when the value of live sports is undeniable, contributing to an industry-leading portfolio of sports programming for Disney. And this integrated streaming experience moves us one step closer to bringing a full sports offering to Disney+ in the U.S. as we prepare for the launch of ESPN's flagship DTC offering in early fall of 2025. Taken as a whole, we have a lot to be proud of, both from a creative and a financial standpoint. And as we look to fiscal 2025 and beyond, we are confident in our continued ability to drive sustained growth and create shareholder value through our world-class portfolio of assets. And now we'll be happy to take your questions.\nCarlos Gomez: Thanks, Bob. As we transition to Q&A, we ask that you please try to limit yourselves to one question in order to help get us through as many questions as possible today. And with that, operator, we are ready to take the first question.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Good morning, and thank you for all the detailed disclosure in the documents this morning and for filing the K along with our earnings. Appreciate it. Bob, I feel like the ESPN flagship launch is, in many ways, sort of the last big strategic pivot of your content assets to streaming after you've already accomplished that on the entertainment side. I know it was interesting you guys were guiding to sports OI growth in 2026, which will be the first year of that product. You also have the NBA costs to absorb. You talked a little bit about it in the prepared release this morning, but can you give us a sense for what you think that product is going to do for sports fans, for ESPN fans? And how it sort of moves the ball forward, sorry for the bad pun, in terms of customer experience and ultimately drives that segment as you look out beyond 2025? Because obviously, the linear challenges are well known on the ESPN side. And I don't know if I could just get you to give us some color on the acceleration in Experiences OI is expecting in 2025 from what we're seeing right now, that would be certainly helpful. Thanks a lot.\nRobert Iger: Thanks, Ben. I'll address the ESPN question that you asked. I think as you look at flagship, you have to consider that it is ESPN like it has never appeared before for the consumer, meaning it will have not only basically the basic ESPN services, which is coverage of live sports and studio shows and commentary. But it'll have many, many other features like betting fully integrated. But I think one of the things that is \u2013 hasn't been appreciated yet is that when you apply technology to the presentation of sports, almost anything is possible. So imagine an AI-driven personalized sports center as a feature, for instance. Imagine essentially being able to tailor your sports experience, not just watching sports center, but in a thoroughly personalized way. I think essentially, it will be designed to serve the consumer in the most compelling way ESPN has ever served the consumer. The other thing I think you have to look at just in terms of being optimistic about the migration is that live is extremely, extremely attractive to advertisers today and live sports, in particular. So if you look at what's going on today, not just with ratings, but with interest from advertisers and then you look at the ad technology that we've already built and that we're continuing to improve, and you consider what that can do in an app-based world, not just in a linear world, the value we can deliver not just at our viewers or customers, but also to our advertisers will be very compelling. So highly customized, highly mobile, fully integrated with all kinds of features and in my opinion, the best product the consumer has ever seen in sports.\nHugh Johnston: Hi, Ben, it's Hugh. Obviously, for Experiences of why we guided to six to eight for the year, Q1 will be negatively impacted, of course, by the combination of the two hurricanes as well as the prelaunch cost for the Treasure. So Q1 will be negative. As we move through the course of the year, we'll move to positive in Q2 and then see further strengthening over the course of the year. The drivers on that are, number one, obviously, the Treasure is coming in, and we'll see continued strengthening from that. Number two, are we overlap our Q4 labor cost in Disneyland Resort. So that will be a positive from a lapse perspective. And then number three, we do expect the consumer to gradually strengthen through the course of the year. We also know that the bookings that we have in the back half of the year are positive right now. So we're optimistic about how bookings are looking as we get into the back half of next year. So hopefully, that's helpful.\nCarlos Gomez: Thanks, Ben. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, sir. And our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with BofA Securities. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. Can you provide an outlook on consolidated advertising growth in coming years? You have so many tools in your tool chest like ad tech capabilities, as you mentioned, Bob. But on one hand, you have the linear challenge. And on the complete opposite end, you have the growth of entertainment and sports and streaming. And then secondly, could you give us some color on CapEx next year because it looks like free cash flow will be modestly down.\nRobert Iger: I spoke with Rita Ferro, who runs global ad sales for the company yesterday, just to get some up-to-the-minute flavor or color on what's going on in the market. One of the things that she said, by the way, is that linear is very strong right now. One of the reasons for that, by the way, is live and also because it provides \u2013 linear provides a differentiated audience than streaming. And the way we integrate those businesses, not just from a programming perspective or technology perspective, but from an advertising perspective gives us some interesting leverage in the business and enables us to offer advertisers a much broader, even deeper offering in terms of avails. So it's basically the combination of both is working for us. We're also programming them in an integrated way. So if you look at the fact that ESPN uses ABC to program the NFL on Monday nights in a simulcast way, significant amount of college football. You'll note when the season opens, NBA will continue to have a great presence on ABC. So you're not only offering the advertiser a differentiated audience and live, but you're also offering the consumer that, meaning the ability to watch sports on multiple platforms. Bottom line, it's working. Hugh? You're on mute, Hugh.\nHugh Johnston: Sorry. So yes, Jessica, I'll add to that as well. As you know, in 2024, advertising were 3%. We expect to be at or stronger than that as we enter 2025. As Bob mentioned, in particular, the ad tech stack that we've put together or our ability to deliver the right ads more effectively to consumers, particularly in the streaming business, is a competitive advantage that we've built. And it's owned and is proprietary to Disney. So we certainly feel optimistic about our ability to gain share in advertising based on that.\nRobert Iger: By the way, one thing I don't think is appreciated is that we're also working well selling inventory with Google and YouTube, basically offering advertisers to buy those platforms a differentiated audience through a trade desk mechanism. And our ad tech obviously enables us to do that.\nCarlos Gomez: Thanks, Jessica. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, sir. And our next question today comes from Robert Fishman with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nRobert Fishman: Great. Thank you. Bob, since hiring Adam Smith from YouTube, anything you can share about his priorities and how that can impact the future of Disney+ or the other streaming products? And then, Hugh, can you maybe just share your confidence in achieving the strong double-digit margins beyond 10% in DTC in fiscal 2026? And because that guidance doesn't include Hulu Live, maybe just help us think about the future of that product, please? Thank you.\nRobert Iger: Thanks for the question. Adam is already hard at work and making progress in improving the technology across all of our streaming businesses. And he's got a number of priorities. One, obviously, is flagship. Another is, as we noted in our comments earlier, that we're launching an ESPN tile on Disney+ on December 4th. So he's working on that. In addition to that, personalization, customization, designed initially to improve engagement. Just basically by adding a stronger recommendation engine capabilities on the home page, we're already seeing increased engagement in a very short period of time. He's going after password sharing. We launched in LatAm just this week, and we now are \u2013 we have password sharing or anti-password sharing initiatives, I think, at over approximately 130 countries. So that's also on his list. We're unifying tech stacks, including media serving and our entire ad stack across Disney+ and Hulu and basically a lot more. Obviously, what we're doing here is designed not only to create a better customer experience, but to increase engagement and reduce churn.\nHugh Johnston: Yes. And Robert, in terms of your answer on confidence around achieving the double-digit margins, it's probably best to sort of go back to the building blocks as to how we get there. Number one, we're looking to continue to grow subscribers as we have. And the thing I'd remind you of in that regard, given the point that we're in many ways that the DTC business shares a lot of the characteristics of a software business where an incremental subscriber has very, very high margins attached to them because it's relatively low incremental cost. So continuing to grow subscribers, number one. Number two, we certainly look to continue to increase pricing in line with the value that we're providing to consumers. And a lot of the growth that we're seeing right now is because of the exceptional content that's coming out of both the movie and the TV studios that's obviously our proprietary content. So that will certainly enable us to increase pricing over time. Number three, as Bob mentioned, a lot of Adam's priorities around product updates and features that will increase engagement and reduce churn, including improving the recommendation engine, is certainly going to be a benefit to our growth, increasing our ad monetization, as I was just discussing with the ad tech that we've built. And then, of course, international is \u2013 continues to be a significant opportunity. So add all of that together, we wouldn't give any of the guidance that we did if we didn't have confidence in delivering.\nCarlos Gomez: Thanks, Robert. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, sir. Our next question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nSteven Cahall: Thank you. So a multi-year guide is really impressive, and it's helpful since there are so many moving pieces of the segment. Over the last five years or so, I think Disney investor experience with guidance has at times been mixed under prior management. So just wondering how we should think about the ideological approach here to guidance as it relates to some of the conservatism that you've baked in. And in broad terms, is the acceleration in EPS growth from fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2026, is that basically just comping the flagship launches and the hurricane and that sort of thing? And then just on flagship, just how do we think about maybe what the year one launch costs are, what the ARPU of that product could be? And when do you think you might be able to get to breakeven on that product? Thank you.\nHugh Johnston: Sure. So why don't I handle the guide? In terms of the way that we're thinking about it, it's really driven by a couple of things. Number one is obviously the significant improvement in DTC, where we've invested a considerable amount of money in building that product. And number two, it's in light of the significant investments that we've made and are going to continue to make in parks and cruise ships and in \u2013 even in consumer products. So as we thought about those investments, we've obviously talked about the results that we've seen. And we feel very, very positively about those results. But we thought it was also very fair to give to investors not just operational results, but an expectation as to what we expect these investments to return, hence, the guidance rather than just focus it on the narrow pieces, although we've given you, I think, good segment detail, we thought it was also important to give you a picture of the overall company. So philosophically, because we've invested, we do feel like it's appropriate for us to give you a multiyear look because these investments are obviously multiyear in nature. In terms of our confidence in delivering it, obviously, we've got confidence in it. Otherwise, we wouldn't do it. We know it's important to deliver the guidance that we give, and that's why we've given it. So as it relates to flagship, I think it's a bit early to be talking about ARPU on flagship. We do think that product will be additive to us in 2026. And yes, there'll be an investment, then that's part of the 2025 guide. But that investment, we're looking to pay back relatively quickly in 2026.\nRobert Iger: To add to that, we have considerable visibility on our content pipeline as well. And one of the things that we've seen lately that is heartening is that when we have success in a feature film or even when there is expected success, the consumption of basically prior films \u2013 movies that have been made prior to the one that's coming out, goes up, spikes significantly on the platform. So if you were to look at the numbers for Inside Out 1 as Inside Out 2's trailer hit or what's happening with the first Moana film or what's happening with a number of Marvel properties since Deadpool & Wolverine came out. And I could go on and on. It's quite interesting for us in terms of raising consumption. So as we look ahead, I noticed some of the films in 2025, which is going to end with Zootopia and Avatar. And then you look at 2026 and you consider that we've got a Star Wars film, Mandalorian and Avengers film, a live-action version of Moana and on and on. We feel that one, we're confident in our ability to execute those films in a way that will serve us well, both qualitatively and commercially; and two, we have a strong sense that they're going to enable us to strengthen our streaming performance significantly as well as we're currently seeing with the films that we're putting out.\nCarlos Gomez: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Hey. Thanks. Two, if I could. First of all, Bob, it looks like Comcast is going to move ahead with a spinoff of the cable networks. And I know you guys have looked at something similar in the past, maybe on the linear entertainment side. Is that something that you guys could revisit either as part of sort of the sort of more industry move? And then maybe more broadly, does the change in the administration, does that change your view on sort of opportunities with regard to M&A? And then secondly, maybe for Hugh, and I know you guys get this question every quarter, but just give us an update on sort of your view on the impact that the launch of the Epic Universe is going to have. It looks like that's going to hit early summer sort of just as you're expecting an acceleration in the parks business, just how you expect that to impact the sort of midyear and that acceleration in Experiences. Thanks.\nRobert Iger: John, Hugh and I will both take the question as it relates to divestitures or consolidation. I'll start on the consolidation front. In 2017 \u2013 late 2017, when we announced initially that we were acquiring assets from 20th Century Fox, we specifically mentioned that we were doing so through the lens of streaming. We saw a world where streaming was going to proliferate, and we knew we needed not only more content with \u2013 but more distribution. And with that came just a tremendous amount of content. We've talked about it when we talk \u2013 when you talk about 60 Emmy's, so much of that came from that acquisition or when we talk about Avatar as for instance, that came from that acquisition. I could go on and on. In addition to that, people forget, that came with control of Hulu and ultimately ownership of Hulu. That distribution packaged well, integrated well with Disney+ has enabled us to achieve the numbers we have achieved, which is approximately 174 million global subscribers and an ability to really see into the future of streaming with \u2013 through a very optimistic lens. So in a way, we've already consolidated. And while I think we'll always look opportunistically at opportunities as we've proven in the past, we certainly don't shy away from those. We, in many respects, have already consolidated. We don't really need more assets right now, either from a distribution or from a content perspective to thrive in basically a disruptive media world.\nHugh Johnston: Got it. And John, I'll answer the divestiture piece as well as your question on Epic. Regarding divestitures, one of the first things I did when I came in as CFO of PepsiCo was to take a look at whether there was an opportunity here to create value through divestitures. And candidly, I just didn't see one, and I spent a considerable amount of time studying it first from a financial perspective. And it's always easy to sort of play with spreadsheets and sort of make the math look like there's value creation. But at the end of the day, there's two things to consider. Number one is, what are the prices you would get? And then number two, what's the frictional cost operationally of separating those assets? And as I went through the math on both, it was pretty clear to me that there wasn't a value-creating opportunity for Disney. I can't speak to other companies and what opportunities they have with the assets they have. But I absolutely did not see that for Disney. Regarding Epic, we did model that into our expectations for the experiences outlook. As I mentioned earlier, the early bookings that we have next summer are actually positive. So that's certainly a positive indicator. We also looked at the history of other attractions opening up and other parks opening up in Florida. And it's generally been beneficial to us. So that is all very much captured in the guide that we provided.\nCarlos Gomez: Thanks, John. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Morris of Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nMichael Morris: Thank you. Good morning, guys. A couple of questions. First, with respect to content production, you've been focused on quality over quantity have you been \u2013 as you've been strengthening the core of the business. How are you thinking about growth in spend into that pipeline going forward, both in 2025 and maybe just sort of the pace of content growth beyond that? And then secondly, appreciate the listing of the new projects that you have on the Experiences side. You have a number of footprint expansions, especially in the U.S. So when you think about the longer-term return on these investments, how much of that is driven by really expanding capacity and accommodating more guests maybe versus driving the pricing power at the parks because you have these great new attractions? Thank you.\nRobert Iger: I'll take the content production side. We feel we have a great hand. But as we look to grow our streaming business, we believe there will be opportunities and even a need for us to do some selective investing outside the United States, notably in EMEA and in APAC. We've slowed down our investment in those markets. And in fact, we're being careful about our overall investment until we get the technology right, until we improve the technology because clearly, if we can use technology to reduce churn, which we're already doing, then in reality, what we're doing is we're increasing return our investment in content. And we don't \u2013 so we don't want to spend on the content side until we're confident that we can get the necessary returns on those investments. But we know as we look to grow our streaming business that prioritizing markets outside the United States with specific content in those markets will be part of that strategy. I don't think you should consider those investments to be enormous in nature by any stretch of the imagination because we know that we're making content that has global application. If you look at just the movies that I mentioned as for instance, that work not in all markets, but in most markets. But we don't have to spend as much as some of our competitors. And as there's movies \u2013 it's not just the franchise value. As they become more successful, obviously, they drive more value as well.\nHugh Johnston: Yes, Mike. And just to add to Bob's comments on that, we have modeled in some incremental growth in content spend, not enough to be significantly disruptive to the overall cash flow or algorithm for the company, but we have absolutely modeled that in because we do view international as a terrific opportunity. Regarding your question on Experiences and particularly the parks pricing versus attendance, what we projected in is a balance of both. So I don't want to get into specific numbers on it. But we're not assuming it's going to be just price or it's just going to be attendance. There'll be a balance of both. And frankly, we'll have the ability to flex that as we learn our way into it. But I think we've got it modeled reasonably conservatively.\nCarlos Gomez: Thanks, Mike. Next question, please.\nOperator: Absolutely. And our next question today comes from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hi. Thank you for the question and forward commentary. One area that understandably received less focus on the outlook was linear network. Interested to understand better how you built the multiyear forecast, how you thought about managing that business over the next several years. And then just relatedly, it's the first call post the DirecTV agreement. Can you speak to any important impact to Disney, how we should think of that deal structure as a template going forward versus some other deals you've done in the recent past like Charter? Thanks.\nHugh Johnston: I'll handle that one, David. Regarding linear, we modeled that it would continue to decline. The beauty of the position we find ourselves in right now with roughly 175 million streaming consumers is we have a bit of a natural hedge in the way that our portfolio operates. So to the degree that people leave linear and choose to go to streaming route, generally speaking, they're going to be coming our way. And we have obviously terrific ways to monetize those. So as that evolves based on consumer choice, I think we're well positioned if they decide to stay in linear for longer. I think we're well positioned if they decide to move over to the streaming side. And frankly, with what we've put on the service and what \u2013 the plans that we have to put more things on the service, I think in many ways, we're sort of a must-have platform inside of most households. Regarding DirecTV, like all of these deals, they're basically uniquely crafted to the situation of that particular partner. So I wouldn't try to read through any of that into any other deals. I think it's a good deal for us. I think it's a good deal for them, and we both feel good about where we've gone. But I think these things are generally going to be somewhat bespoke.\nCarlos Gomez: Thanks, David. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, sir. And our next question today comes from Laurent Yoon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nLaurent Yoon: Thank you for taking the question. It's great to see continuing momentum in streaming, and the margin expansion story is certainly very promising. Building on your comments around the building blocks of that growth, could you provide some color on how much of that growth is subscriber growth versus pricing in the foreseeable future and of course, 2025 \u2013 fiscal year 2025, in particular. And on a related question, local language content seems paramount to \u2013 very important to increase engagement in local markets. And we see our competitors expanding local content perhaps more than what we see on Disney platforms. So do you have plans to be more aggressive in international expansion with more locally tailored content? Thank you.\nHugh Johnston: Sure. Happy to address those. Regarding streaming, we expect our growth to come from a balance of pricing as well as growth. It may tilt slightly towards pricing. And again, we're going to read the market, and we can react to it as it plays out. But our expectation right now is it will be both subs and pricing, a little bit more tilted towards pricing. Regarding local content, I'm not sure I have much more to add to what Bob had already mentioned, which is we do see it as valuable. We actually do a reasonable amount of that already, particularly in APAC with some of the Korean dramas that we do, and we also do some in Latin America. But as Bob mentioned, we don't want to invest too heavily there until we feel like we're comfortable with the product such that we'll have the churn operating at right levels. So that's my expectation.\nRobert Iger: I'll add to that. We had two billion-dollar movies so far this year, actually the only two in the industry. The box office that those movies garnered came from all over the world. So those movies resonate in those markets. And if you look at some of our competitors who don't have movies of basically that quality or that level of success, they have to spend more in local content because they don't have that. The other thing I would just want to say about pricing is it's not just about raising pricing, it's about moving consumers to the advertiser-supported side of the streaming platform. So right now, in the United States, about 60% of all new subs are going to \u2013 are buying our streaming services, advertiser support or AVOD. I think right now, I think it's 37% of total subs in the U.S. are AVOD subs and \u2013 37% in the U.S. and 30% globally. So the pricing that we recently put into place, which has increased pricing, was actually designed to move more people in the AVOD direction because we know the ARPU and interest in it from advertisers and streaming has grown.\nCarlos Gomez: Thanks, Laurent. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nTim Nollen: Hi. Thanks, very much. Could you please address the topic of divestitures in India? I think you mentioned in the guidance a few lines that incorporate those. I just wonder if there's anything more to add to adjustments we should make for the sale of the assets in India? And then relatedly, what are the \u2013 what is the business going to look like for you in India? I think you're going to retain a stake with Reliance. Just talk a little bit about your presence in India post the divestiture or the partial sale, please.\nHugh Johnston: Yes, happy to address that. We're very, very excited about the deal with Reliance. Obviously, they're a terrific company and have huge presence in India. Going forward, we will have a percentage ownership...\nRobert Iger: I was supposed to disclose those AVOD numbers...\nHugh Johnston: We'll have a percentage ownership in the high 30s. And obviously, the Reliance people with their share of ownership will be managing the business. In terms of the specific implications on Disney's financials, we did anticipate closing. We've got it included in the guidance. To the degree that you have more detailed questions around that, I'm sure the Investor Relations team can help you model that out.\nCarlos Gomez: Thanks, Tim. Operator, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. And today's final question will come from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Kraft: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask just one on Parks and one on Disney+. So on Parks, is the softness in domestic behind you at this point? It seems like performance there was better than you expected when you reported back in August. And on the international side, it seems like there was some new softness that showed up in 4Q in the international parks. So in light of that, I just wanted to ask how we should think about international growth going forward? And then my question on Disney+ really has to do with the sub growth in the quarter, which was strong in international core subs. Was there anything chunky in the quarter like a wholesale relationship coming online? Or is this seasonality? I know there was a similar jump in 4Q 2023, or was it some other factor? Thank you.\nRobert Iger: Sure. Happy to take those, Bryan. You're right. In domestic, we certainly feel like the consumer is strengthening. As I mentioned earlier, we obviously saw growth in domestic parks and certainly feel very positively about that. And that's our expectation going forward, is a gradual strengthening in the consumer. Regarding international, two factors. Number one, the Olympics in Paris, that whenever there is an Olympics in the city that we have a park, we typically see an attendance hit, and that's exactly what we saw. We saw that coming, which is why we indicated that to you back on the Q3 call in terms of our expectation. In addition to that, we saw some consumer softness in Shanghai. Candidly, we expect that to be temporary, and we expect that to bounce back as well. But it was nothing that should be concerning for the long-term regarding the parks. Regarding international subs, no, nothing chunky. This was good solid additions to the subscriber base in international. So we came off of Q3 and obviously had considerable success in adding subs in Q4.\nCarlos Gomez: Thanks, Bryan, and thanks, everyone, for your questions. We want to thank you again for joining us, and wish everyone a good rest of the day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call, and we thank you all for attending today's presentation.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After some brief introductory remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Alexia Quadrani, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani: Good morning. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to The Walt Disney Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Our press release, Form 10-Q and management's prepared remarks were issued earlier this morning and are available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast and a replay and transcript as well as the third quarter earnings presentation will all be made available on our website after the call. As we previously announced, today's call will follow a new format consisting only of a question-and-answer session. Joining me this morning are Bob Iger, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As we start the Q&A session, we ask that you please try to limit yourself to one question in order to help us get to as many analysts as possible today. And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Yes, ma'am. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. I'm going to try to squeeze in two, one on theme parks and one on NBA. So first on theme parks, there's really a lot of moving pieces here. Can you provide color on global park demand and where you expect this protracted weakness? Maybe include the benefit from cruise ships, since you have three ships coming on over the next, I guess, 18 months or so. And with the stated fiscal Q4 mid-single-digit decline and the expectation that this will last for several quarters, is that the right level to think about OI as we think about fiscal '25? And on the NBA, with the rights now complete, you'll likely have several hundred million dollar step-up when the new contract begins in fiscal '26. Are there incremental monetization drivers, including maybe WNBA growth that can make the new contract profitable in the early years? Thank you.\nHugh Johnston: Great. Thanks, Jessica. This is Hugh. Good morning. That was a six-part first question. So I'll try to answer it as best I can. First, just to sort of peel apart Q3 again. I want to emphasize we actually had 2% revenue growth in Q3. The reason, obviously, is the IP is so strong in our parks. It really does attract a strong audience and people are reluctant to cancel vacations. So while we saw a slight moderation in demand, I certainly wouldn't call it a significant change. That said 40% of the Experiences business is actually not domestic parks. It's either international parks or consumer products and that's from an operating income perspective. 60% is domestic parks, including cruise ships. Within that, we saw attendance flat in the quarter and we saw per caps up a little bit. We expect to see a flattish revenue number in Q4 coming out of the parks. And as we mentioned in, earlier in the letter, really just a few quarters. So I don't think I'd refer to it as protracted, but just a couple of quarters of likely similar results. Now, keep in mind, we do have some expenses attached to our ships coming in and that will affect us a bit in '24 and a bit in '25. But overall I would just call this as a bit of a slowdown that's being more than offset by the entertainment business both what we've seen so far and our expectations for Moana 2 as well as Mufasa.\nRobert Iger: Regarding the NBA deal, Jessica, first of all, let me just remind you and everyone that the deal doesn't kick in next year, it's a year later. We have one more year on the current deal. And as we looked at it, first of all, one goal was to maintain what we'll call the A package, which means we've got the finals for 11 more years or now we have the finals for 12 years and they drive significant value for us. Also, overall, the deal reflects the value of live programming. We know that that's been an advertiser's delight and also an audience's delight. It also reflects the growing value of basketball and the growing value of women's sports. There's a large WNBA component to this. Also as part of this deal and has been the strategy of ESPN for a while to lock in sports rights for a long period of time. It secures our ability to bring ESPN in the digital direction, particularly as we look to launch flagship sometime at the end of 2025. So we believe that by the time this kicks in and a year from now that a lot of the pieces will be in place in terms of driving more advertising revenue, more distribution revenue, moving to digital. And another thing that we've done here is we've secured international rights, particularly to the finals, not in every market around the world, but in most markets. And that will drive some added revenue as well. Not going to be specific about the profitability in the early years, but there's tremendous value in this deal.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Ben Swinburne at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thank you. Good morning. Maybe for Bob. I wanted to ask you about sort of the outlook for Disney+ both in the context of where the product's going, but also how this becomes a significant earnings contributor to the company as you look ahead. We look at the product, it's really broadening. You've got obviously brought in Hulu. Now you're adding news. A lot of sports, ESPN coming in. You've added the international NBA rights to the product overseas. What's the vision here? And in your mind, does it support both continued subscriber growth and pricing power? I think there's probably some concern out there that the recent price increases might face some consumer pushback. So I'd love to get your thoughts on that big topic. And then just wanted to clarify, Hugh, when you say flattish revenue, Q4, are you talking about at the Experiences segment level or is that just the domestic parks comment? Just wanted to clarify. Thank you.\nRobert Iger: Let me start by saying that what we've been seeing with streaming is significant success, driven largely by the success of our creativity, whether it's in the television side. The company had 183 Emmy Nominations, for instance, led by shows like Shogun and The Bear and Abbott Elementary and Only Murders in the Building. And I can go on and on. And obviously on top of the television success creatively, we've had huge success in the motion picture front recently. And when you look at what the current motion picture lineup drives in terms of value on streaming, it's profound. So Inside Out, as it's in our comments today, the first film has had tremendous consumption since the first trailer for Inside Out 2 launched in November. The same thing is true for the early Deadpool movies, for the early Planet of the Apes movies, I could go on and on. So when we look across our portfolio of IP, and this includes Disney branded, Fox branded, obviously everything that's on Hulu, programming from FX, programming from ABC, National Geographic, what we're basically seeing is we're seeing growth in consumption and the popularity of our offerings, which gives us the pricing leverage that we believe we have. So every time we've taken a price increase, we've had only modest churn from that. Nothing that we would consider significant. We believe that as we add these new features like the channels that we're going to be adding later this year that and the success of our movie slate, and I'll get into that a little bit more, that the pricing leverage that we have is actually increased. We're not concerned. The goal is to grow engagement on the platform. And what I mean by that is obviously offering a wider variety of programming, which is why we're adding news, why we're adding the ESPN tile to it, while we're bundling aggressively to give consumers the ability to buy across all of our basically creative engines. And we feel very bullish about the future of this business. We're not saying much more about it, except you can expect that it's going to grow nicely in fiscal 2025. The other thing I want to add is that we've been talking a lot about adding the technology features that we need to basically make it a higher return, a higher margin business and a more successful business. And we're doing that right now. We started our password sharing initiative in June. That kicks in, in earnest in September. By the way, we've had no backlash at all to the notifications that have gone out and to the work that we've already been doing. We know that we need stronger recommendation engines and we're working on that technology and we need to make our marketing more efficient. But by adding all of these features, both on the technological side and also on the programming side, we're bullish about the future of this business. And then when you think about it over to Hugh mentioned Moana and Mufasa, let me just read to you the movies that we'll be making and releasing in the next almost two years. We have Moana, Mufasa, Captain America, Snow White, Thunderbolts, Fantastic Four, Zootopia, Avatar, Avengers, Mandalorian, and Toy Story, just to name a few. And when you think about not only the potential of those in box office, but the potential of those to drive global streaming value, I think, there's a reason to be bullish about where we're headed.\nHugh Johnston: And Ben to answer your other question, flattish was a reference to Experiences.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, ma'am. Our next question today comes from Robert Fishman with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nRobert Fishman: Thank you. Bob, as you think about the future of content spending for Disney, especially after the NBA deal and all the content that you're just talking about now. What is the right balance of investment between sports, scripted TV and movies going forward? And then for Hugh, can you just update us on free cash flow expectations this year with one quarter to go and how to think about the parks impact and the content spending on free cash flow in '25? Thank you.\nRobert Iger: Well, we obviously are investing significantly in all directions because of the value that it creates and also because of the value that it represents to our future in streaming. We talked about sports, the long-term deals that we've made. Obviously, College Football is part of that. And on top of the NBA, on top of the NFL, on the movie side, we've talked a lot about our the creative improvements that our studio has brought to bear and the quality of the IP and the known quality of our IP. And television, I can't say enough about how great our television businesses have been performing both in terms of the bottom line, but also in terms of creatively. You don't get 183 Emmy Nominations by accident. That's the work of a lot of really great, talented people, meaning on the management side, working with a lot of talented, creative people. So it's a balance, it's a mix and I think it's one that you'll ultimately see really blended together as our streaming platform grows over time.\nHugh Johnston: And, Robert, on free cash flow. We had previously guided to $8 billion. We don't have any news on that, but if there were a material change on it, obviously we would have changed the guide.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nSteven Cahall: Thanks. So, Hugh, you talked about DTC getting to double-digit margins with the big price increases and the paid sharing efforts coming. I was wondering if you could just update us on your thinking. We'd love to get some timing around double-digit margins if that's something you're comfortable with at this point, but any context would be helpful. And then just on parks, as we think about cruise ship pre-opening costs in there, what's implied in the fourth quarter and as we think about cruise pre-opening costs in fiscal '25, what do those look like? I think you'll sail the Treasure, but you've still got the Adventure and the Destiny. I think the Singapore dock is a little heavier on cost, so we just love to understand that component. Thank you.\nHugh Johnston: Sure. Happy to talk about both. In terms of the journey on getting to double-digit margins, the levers haven't changed and frankly we're actually doing quite well with them. Bundling has had a positive impact on churn. So from that perspective, obviously, that helps us with growth, which is one of the drivers. Password-sharing is just starting to roll out. That's also going to be helpful in terms of driving growth. We've announced pricing and we feel good with all of the value that we're providing to consumers. With all the creative that Bob mentioned earlier and all the creative that's still to come. We do feel like we've earned that pricing in the marketplace and we feel positively about that. With that will come scale benefits. The product improvements also should reduce churn and keep our consumers with us as they're evaluating their options. And then obviously we're going to look at the entire cost structure and continue to drive productivity. In terms of timing, no update on that. It's something that we've said we are approaching with great urgency. We still intend to do that. Obviously, I think, we've made a ton of progress. We were losing $1 billion a quarter not all that long ago and now we're making money and our expectation is we're going to continue on that journey to making more money to get to and then ultimately well surpass the double-digit margins that we've talked about. Regarding the cruise ships, we've shared a number for this year. The number will be a little over double that in terms of the startup costs in 2025. So you can assume that, that'll be about that. That said, the cruise ships tend to pay back very quickly. So we certainly feel positive about those investments.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hi. Thank you. On Sports, Bob wanted to see if you could update on strategic partner conversations for ESPN. Is this still a priority? And if so, can you refresh on what you're looking for in terms of marketing or content? And then for Hugh, in the exact commentary, there's multiple references to tightly managing costs. So I wanted to see if you could expand on this, where you're realizing savings now, how much opportunities left? Thanks.\nRobert Iger: I know I've sounded like a broken record because I've talked about strategic partnerships for ESPN over the last number of quarters. The only thing I can say is, believe it or not, we're still having conversations about it. We thought and continue to believe there may be opportunities to partner with others, particularly on the content side, and that's why we've continued to explore it. But nothing more to add.\nHugh Johnston: Right. And regarding cost, recall, our original cost estimate was $5.5 billion. We raised that to in excess of $7.5 billion. Look, in big companies, my worldview is there's always opportunity to do more with less. So we're going to continue to go after it aggressively as we can to both deliver the bottom line and to invest back in the business with all the great opportunities we have.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Maybe first on the parks. Any further details in terms of the softening and the flat revenues that you expect for 4Q and looking out into '25. I mean, do you expect attendance to continue to soften or potentially turn negative and just any commentary on what you're seeing or expectations are on the per cap side? And then secondly, Venu launches this fall, just any expectations in terms of what it could do to trend in the linear business for you guys? Thanks.\nHugh Johnston: Yeah, I'll take that. In terms of the parks business, I've kind of given you a lot of our expectation already. I'm not sure I'm ready to peel it down to attendance versus per caps. I think, again, we're going to be pretty consistent with what we saw in Q3. And we talked about the fact that the lower income consumer is feeling a little bit of stress. The high income consumer is traveling internationally a bit more. I think you're just going to see more of a continuation of those trends in terms of the top line. And then the bottom line will be reflective of the fact that we've got some one-time costs coming in and going out both this year and last year. I do expect to see international strengthen. Disneyland Paris has obviously felt some challenge due to the Olympics. Not a surprise, but something that happens. And the good news is the Olympics are over in a couple of weeks and the booking will certainly look good in that regard. So overall feeling positively on that front.\nAlexia Quadrani: Next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, ma'am. Our next question comes from Michael Morris at Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nMichael Morris: Thank you. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask you on ARPU at domestic Disney+. It did slip a little bit in the quarter and you cited the impact of subscriber mix shift. Are you saying that that's a function of bundling in terms of mix shift or is it mix shift to the ad-supported tier? And if so, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the CTV environment, how you're performing there? And just one follow-up on the Experiences segment. We generally think of parks vacations as being booked pretty well in advance. So it was a little bit surprising to hear about demand moderation within the quarter. So can you help us a little bit with how much visibility you feel like you have? And if it does vary by quarter, if there's maybe less advanced bookings in certain quarters versus others? Thank you.\nHugh Johnston: Yeah. To answer the question on ARPU, you hit both points correctly. Number one, bundling has a small effect. And then in addition to that, the shift to the ad model certainly has a small effect as well. From a profitability standpoint, we're pretty happy with whether people choose the ad model or the ad-free model. Regarding visibility, we do have very good visibility, which is why I'm emphasizing. These are really all changes at the margins, daily visitors and late bookers and things like that. Looking forward, we have very good visibility into the book that we're expecting, which is why I've got a good level of confidence in the projections that I'm sharing with you.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Bryan Kraft at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Kraft: Hi. Good morning. I had two if I could. Just first on advertising. You highlighted the strong results from the upfront this year, which is very encouraging. But I wanted to ask what you're seeing more immediately in terms of advertising demand today, given some of the macro pressures that have recently come to light. Are advertisers becoming more cautious? Are you seeing that in more in the real-time ad sales part of the business? And then just on the content sales and licensing part of the business, the press release mentioned increased sales of TV content and content sales, licensing, and other as a driver of the OI performance this quarter, along with the box office of course. Is there anything to read into this? Is it the beginning of a trend toward increasing content licensing to third parties or is just a timing benefit or one-off? Thank you.\nHugh Johnston: Sure. Happy to talk about it. Ad market is actually very healthy right now. We saw overall advertising grow 8% for the quarter. ESPN was up 17%, DTC streaming was actually up 20%. So certainly feeling very, very positively in that regard. And in terms of the categories, financial services, consumer products doing very well, consumer services doing very well and technology doing very well. Auto is a little bit softer in that regard. But overall, the ad market is really, really strong and healthy for us. And a lot of that is a product of the fact that we have live sports and the fact that our streaming service is doing so well in terms of the IP that we have. It's an attractive audience. We also have a new capability called Disney Streaming that allows us to basically sell across our platforms very effectively. We're selling audiences rather than just selling streaming channels, which enables advertisers to more effectively target the audiences that they're seeking. So from a technology perspective, we're seeing good payback. The second piece was around licensing. Yeah, the licensing numbers that you see are mostly a reality around the fact that we've had so much success at the box office. That's really what's driving things more than anything else. No change in our licensing strategy, which has been pretty clear. The things that we consider core IP to the company, we don't license. There are things that are non-strategic. We'll continue to license tactically. But it's not a big strategy for us. The big strategy is producing our own IP and monetizing it.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you. Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Yes, ma'am. Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. So maybe in theme parks, I mean, there's a few growth elements I guess over the next few years in terms of cruise ships and broadly other CapEx investments that you're making in the parks. Maybe if you could just step back and talk about what kind of growth impact you expect, maybe over the next two or three years, and if that can offset to what extent that can offset some of the weakness you're seeing in the parks, that would be useful. And then one other segment which probably goes out of your numbers next year is India. And that's been a loss-making business. So to the extent you can talk about the potential earnings contribution once India is deconsolidated that would be much appreciated. Thank you.\nHugh Johnston: Yeah. Good morning, Kannan. Two things. One, obviously, the investments that we're making into the Experiences business, we feel very, very good about it. It's been a great returning business for a long time. So while I'm not here to give you long-term guidance in terms of that segment of the business. We wouldn't be making capital investments in an accelerated way if we didn't expect to accelerate growth out of those businesses and that's true of the cruise ships as well. Now, keep in mind, that the lead time on investments in this business are multiple years. So when exactly all of that manifests, we'll share with you as we go along. But, obviously, we're investing because we're looking to accelerate growth and hence the term turbocharge. Regarding the India question, we will share that when we close the deal. I think that's the right time to do it. And we'll lay it out for you all very clearly so that you can model it very, very effectively.\nAlexia Quadrani: Okay. Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded.\n I would now like to turn the conference over to Alexia Quadrani, Executive Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nAlexia Quadrani: Good morning. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to the Walt Disney Company's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Our press release was issued earlier this morning and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay and transcript as well as the second quarter earnings presentation will all be made available on our website after the call.\n Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Hugh, we will be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started. \nRobert Iger: Thank you, Alexia, and good morning, everyone. Our strong performance in Q2 demonstrates we are delivering on our strategic priorities while building for the future. Overall, this was another impressive quarter for us with adjusted earnings per share up 30% compared to prior year. And I'm pleased to say this outperformance raises our full year adjusted EPS growth target to 25%.\n Our results were driven in large part by our Experiences segment and our streaming business, which achieved an important milestone with the entertainment portion of the streaming business, achieving profitability in the quarter. This is a testament to the turnaround we set in motion last year and the outstanding leadership of Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman, Alan Bergman and Dana Walden. It is particularly noteworthy when you consider we reported peak losses only 18 months ago.\n We also remain on track to reach profitability in our combined streaming businesses in Q4. We've said all along our path to profitability will not be linear. And while we are anticipating a softer third quarter due in large part to the seasonality of our India sports offerings, we fully expect streaming to be a growth driver for the company in the future and we have prioritized the steps necessary to achieve this.\n In March, we successfully launched Hulu on Disney+, bringing extensive general entertainment content to the platform for bundled subscribers, and we're encouraged by the early results. And by the end of this calendar year, we will be adding an ESPN title to Disney+ giving all U.S. subscribers access to select live games and studio programming within the Disney+ app. We see this as a first step to bring ESPN to Disney+ viewers as we ready the launch of our enhanced stand-alone ESPN streaming service in the fall of 2025.\n The key to our success in streaming and what consistently brings consumers back for more is the array of exceptional content we produce that captivates audiences of all ages and backgrounds. Looking at our film studios. We have a number of highly anticipated theatrical releases arriving over the next few months, including Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, which opens this Friday, as well as Pixar's Inside Out 2, Marvel's Deadpool and Wolverine and 20th Century Studios, Alien: Romulus, which are all slated for this summer.\n Later this year, we're looking forward to Moana 2 and Mufasa: The Lion King. And in 2025, our slate remains just as robust with Captain America: Brave New World, Fantastic Four, Elio, Zootopia 2 and Avatar 3. Our series also continued to resonate with audiences and critics alike. FX's Shogun has proven to be a global hit, with success on both linear and streaming. It's tracking as FX's most watched show ever on our streaming platforms, and it's driving the second largest number of sign-ups to our streaming services since 2022, behind only Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. This is a great example of how we are successfully reaching wider audiences with our combined linear and streaming ecosystem.\n In Q2, series that aired on linear networks accounted for 17 of the top 20 most viewed series on our streaming platforms with almost 3 billion hours of consumption. Our linear channels are deeply embedded in our direct-to-consumer strategy as they continue to deliver high-quality content that reaches demographics not captured on streaming alone, allowing us to broaden our audiences and leverage our unmatched content engine across an expansive base.\n Turning to ESPN. Sports continues to stand out when it comes to convening large audiences with recent big ratings wins across a variety of sports. ESPN had a fantastic April in terms of total day viewership, the highest April since 2012. For Primetime viewership, it was ESPN's highest April on record. The NCAA Women's Final Four in Cleveland was the most viewed on record and the championship between Iowa and South Carolina was ESPN's most viewed college basketball game ever, men's or women's.\n We also saw record-breaking ratings for the WNBA draft. Monday Night Football had its most watched season since 2000, and the NFL postseason also broke viewership records. The divisional playoff game between the Houston Texans and Baltimore Ravens was ESPN's most watched NFL game ever with 32.4 million viewers. Looking at our experiences business, which remained an impressive financial driver in the quarter, we are focused on turbocharging growth with a number of long-term strategic investments.\n That includes our Disneyland Forward initiative the first step in our expansion plans at Disneyland Resort, which received unanimous preliminary approval by the Anaheim City Council last month. This was a significant milestone and the final vote is expected to take place this evening. We're incredibly excited for the many potential new stories our guests could experience at Walt's original theme park including the much anticipated opportunity to bring Avatar to Disneyland.\n When you consider all of our businesses as a whole, from entertainment, to sports, to experiences, it's clear that no one has what Disney has. The turnaround and growth initiatives we set in motion last year have continued to yield positive results, and we are executing against our ambitious strategic priorities with both speed and determination.\n To walk you through more of our results from the quarter, I will now turn things over to Hugh. \nHugh Johnston: Thanks, Bob. Diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items, for the second fiscal quarter were $1.21 and reflect the second quarter in a row of strong double-digit percentage year-over-year earnings growth. We also met or exceeded all of our financial guidance for the quarter. And as Bob mentioned, we are now targeting adjusted EPS growth of 25% for the full year.\n At our Entertainment segment, second quarter operating income increased by over 70% versus prior year, driven by direct-to-consumer. Entertainment DTC revenue increased 2% sequentially and 13% year-over-year and generated operating income of $47 million. These results exceeded our guidance primarily due to expense savings. Core Disney+ subscribers increased by $6.3 million in the quarter, reflecting nearly 8 million additions domestically driven by charter entitlements and a slight loss internationally from the impacts of wholesale deal changes and price increases.\n Disney+ core ARPU increased sequentially by 6% or $0.44 reflecting price increases for the domestic premium tier as well as international ARPU growth, partially offset by lower ad supported ARPU domestically, driven by dilution from charter entitlements. And the recent Charter deal also drove Disney+ ad tier subscriber growth in the quarter. We ended Q2 with 22.5 million ad tier subscribers globally. We are pleased with the progress we're making in streaming, although as we said before, the path to long-term profitability is not a linear one.\n On that note, we are forecasting a loss for entertainment DTC in the third quarter, the vast majority of which is due to Disney+ Hotstar's ICC Cricket rights. We also do not expect to see core subscriber growth at Disney+ in the third quarter, but anticipate sub growth will return in Q4.\n As Bob mentioned, we continue to expect our combined streaming businesses to be profitable in the fourth quarter and expect further improvements in profitability in fiscal 2025. At Entertainment linear networks, a decrease in operating income versus the prior year was primarily driven by lower affiliate and advertising revenue domestically and lower affiliate revenue internationally. And at content sales, licensing and other lower Q2 results versus the prior year reflect the absence of significant theatrical releases in the quarter.\n For Q3, we expect this business to generate modestly positive operating income, an improvement over the prior quarter and prior year. Moving to sports. Second quarter operating income decreased slightly versus the prior year, driven primarily by a decrease at ESPN, offset by improved results at Star India sports. As expected, at ESPN, lower results at the domestic business reflects higher programming and production costs from the timing of an additional college football playoff game in the quarter versus the prior year, which were only partially offset by higher ad revenue.\n Domestic affiliate revenue also decreased in the quarter. ESPN domestic ad sales increased by more than 20% versus the prior year or high single digits when adjusted for the college football playoff timing shift of an additional game as well as a new NFL divisional playoff game in Q2 of this year. Q3 to date, we are seeing healthy demand driven by the NBA playoffs and domestic ESPN cash ad sales are pacing up.\n At Star, higher results in Q2 versus the prior year include the impact of a decrease in programming and production costs attributable to the nonrenewal of BCCI cricket rights. Looking ahead, note that we are currently expecting to incur linear ICC rights expense at Star India in Q3. At Experiences, second quarter revenue grew 10%, operating income grew 12%, and segment margins expanded by 60 basis points versus the prior year. Parks and Experiences OI increased by 13% year-over-year and consumer products OI increased by 7%.\n Strong international Parks growth was driven by Hong Kong Disneyland Resort while Walt Disney World and the Cruise business both contributed to domestic growth. At Disneyland, despite growing attendance and per capita spend, results declined year-over-year due to cost inflation including from higher labor expenses. We continue to expect robust operating income growth that experiences for the full year. However, third quarter OI is expected to come in roughly comparable to the prior year.\n Several noncomparable or timing-related items are expected to adversely impact Q3 results, including timing of media and tech expenses, noncomparable items in the prior year at consumer products and the timing of Easter. Beyond these comparability related headwinds, the third quarter's results will be impacted by 3 additional factors, higher wage expenses, preopening expenses related to the Disney Treasure and Adventure Cruise ships as well as Disney Cruise Line's New Island Lookout Cay and some normalization of post-COVID demand.\n As it relates to demand, while consumers continue to travel in record numbers, and we are still seeing healthy demand, we are seeing some evidence of a global moderation from peak post-COVID travel. While pressures from wages, preopening costs and demand impacts are expected to persist in Q4, we do expect year-over-year experiences operating income growth to rebound significantly in the fourth quarter due to fewer comparability or timing factors.\n On an enterprise level, we continue to make good progress on our cost efficiency initiatives and remain positioned to exceed our $7.5 billion annualized target. We still expect to generate over $8 billion in free cash flow this fiscal year and the shareholder return goals we've previously spoken about are also still very much on track. We repurchased $1 billion of stock in the second quarter. We continue to position the company for long-term growth and profitability and are making tangible progress on generating compounding earnings and free cash flow growth, which will enable us to continue returning capital to shareholders.\n I'll now hand the call back to Alexia for Q&A. \nAlexia Quadrani: Thanks, Hugh. [Operator Instructions] And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. \nSteven Cahall: So first, thanks for that detail on Parks and Experiences and what you expect in the third quarter. I just wanted to dig into some of those demand comments a little more. So as you start to lap some of the post-COVID rebound, what's your expectation for attendance maybe at the domestic level and at the global level as you start to exit fiscal '24 and into '25?\n Do you think things will continue to be stable? Or are any of those softening trends sufficient that you expect attendance to have any kind of year-on-year declines? And then on the DTC side of things, Hugh, I think you've talked about a double-digit operating margin as the aspiration. I was wondering if you could just give us any timing as to when we can expect those types of margins? And maybe you could speak to the underlying performance of DTC excluding Hotstar since I think you're going to be consolidating that next year? \nRobert Iger: Great. Steve, happy to weigh in on both of those. First, in terms of attendance, what we're basically communicating is relative to the post-COVID highs, things are tending to normalize. The Parks business did 10% growth in the quarter. And obviously, that's an extremely high revenue number. That said, we still see in the bookings that we look ahead towards indicate healthy growth in the business.\n So we still certainly feel good about the opportunities for continued strong growth. In addition to that, just to comment a bit more on the timing. As I mentioned on the intro, we do have some onetime expenses occurring in Q3. If we were to back out one-timers both for Q3 and Q4, we expect OI for the quarter to be in the mid- to high single-digit range for Q3 and to be double digit for Q4.\n So certainly feel like the Parks business is still doing very, very well. Obviously, we've got the best in the business in terms of product and people still have a strong desire to basically go on vacation and come to see us.\n With regard to DTC margins, a couple of comments on that. First, our goal with this business is to make it a great growth business with healthy margins, right? We want both, not one versus the other. We've got a lot of levers that give us strong reasons to believe that there's good growth in front of us, whether it's the great programming we have, whether it's higher engagement through bundling. And we've got examples of that coming in Latin America as well as adding the sports tile, the ESPN tile to our Disney+ offering.\n And obviously, we've already added Hulu. In addition to that, password sharing remains an opportunity. We're just getting started on reducing distribution costs or an opportunity and leveraging technology for direct-to-consumer marketing as well as recommendation engines, which help both on the revenue and cost side. And ultimately, we'll get to building out the international business even more strongly.\n So from the perspective of building the business, it will be a combination of both managing costs more tightly but also growth, which will allow us to leverage the cost structure we have right now. And we feel very, very positively about that. Specific timing, I'm not going to comment on for margins. I don't like to get ahead of the next year until we get to the next year.\n And in addition to that, from a competitive perspective, I'd rather not give my competitors the pathway and exactly how and when we're going to achieve the margin goals we're looking to achieve. But overall, business is in great shape, and we feel good about the growth prospects. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. \nBenjamin Swinburne: Two questions. Bob, on ESPN, there's obviously a lot of focus on the NBA. You've got a lot going on in terms of new product launches, rights packages coming up. You sound as bullish as ever on sort of pivoting this business. Can you just talk about the next kind of 12 to 18 months and what we think -- what do you think ESPN looks like a couple of years from now?\n And specifically, if you think you can grow this business from an OI point of view, while navigating what is clearly a still inflationary sports rights environment? And then I would love to just get your perspective on sort of the health of the IP at your studios. I know we've talked about this a lot since you've come back into the CEO role. But you -- specifically a lot of Marvel content coming, both on TV and film over the next couple of years. That's an area investors are particularly focused on. How are you feeling about the sort of pipeline on the Marvel side specifically and whether you think this IP is being reinvigorated to the extent you'd like it to be? \nRobert Iger: Thanks, Ben. First on ESPN. I think you have to start in terms of projecting the next 12 to 18 months and also considering where it might go from an OI perspective, as it transitions more to a digital business. You have to look at today and the ratings success of ESPN's phenomenal menu of sports product or the ratings success of live sports in general across the business.\n I mean what you saw with obviously the women's NCAA basketball championships. But across the board, I mentioned in my comments, what the April numbers look like, highest April on record as it for instance, in Primetime at ESPN. So I see sports continuing basically to shine in a world where there's just considerably more choice. Live matters. The other thing that's really important is the engagement that live generates. And I mentioned in my comments, which we haven't really talked about much.\n And I guess a lot of attention has been on the JV that we announced as well as on flagship, which has taken ESPN direct at the end of '25. But at the end of this year, we're going to put an ESPN tile on Disney+ which will have a modest amount of programming, but it's a start in terms of essentially conditioning the audience or subscribers to Disney+ and Hulu, the fact that sports is going to be there. And it also will help us in terms of overall engagement with our bundle.\n As I look ahead, I think ESPN is going to make a pivot toward digital, but without abandoning linear. So it will remain on linear if people want to get ESPN and its different channels through a cable or a satellite subscription, that's fine. And if they want to pivot smoothly because there will be many different access points to get the digital product to ESPN Digital. They can do so as part of a bundle with other sports services. They can do so directly from ESPN with the ESPN app or they can do it as part of a bundle with our own services. So I feel very bullish about it.\n You also have to look at the menu of sports rights that ESPN has bought and Hugh did a good job describing this on the air this morning in one of his interviews. First of all, we've locked up long-term deals with significant sports organizations. That includes college football championships, all the NCAA championships and the NFL. We're confident or optimistic we're going to end up with an NBA deal that will be long term in our best interest and the best interest of our subscribers.\n And then you look at all the studio product, there's really nothing like ESPN in the sports world and their hand is solid for the next decade. So I feel I'm very bullish, smooth transition to digital, multiple touch points for the consumer, quality programming and sports in general live being very, very attractive in terms of its programming.\n IP at the studio. I've talked a lot about this, as you know. We feel great about the slate coming up, including 3 of the big movies that we have with Planet of the Apes this weekend. Followed by Inside Out 2, which is a great film. And then Deadpool, you mentioned Marvel Ben, in -- coming in July. And then the end of the year, we've got -- we have Alien in the end of the summer, and then we've got Moana 2 and Mufasa at the end of the year.\n We've been working hard with the studio to reduce output and focus more on quality. That's particularly true with Marvel. I know you mentioned television shows. Some of what is coming up is a vestige of basically a desire in the past to increase volume. We're slowly going to decrease volume and go to probably about 2 TV series a year instead of what had become 4 and reduce our film output from maybe 4 a year to 2 to the maximum 3.\n And we're working hard on what that path is. We've got a couple of good films in '25. And then we're heading to more Avengers, which we're extremely excited about. So -- and overall, I feel great about the slate. It's something, as you know, that I've committed to spending more and more time on. The team is, I think, one that I have tremendous confidence in. And the IP that we're mining, including all the sequels that we're doing is second to none. So I feel really good about what's coming up. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities. \nJessica Reif Cohen: I will also have 2 different topics. First, on I guess, advertising, direct-to-consumer. Can you give us your thoughts going into the upfront, particularly with the integration of the Trade Desk and Google's TV 360? How does that impact advertising? And any comment you can give us on pivot sharing, like when will you implement it in multitude of borrowers or sharers?\n And then last thing on DTC, but ESPN+ lost subs, which was a little surprising. Can you give us some color on what happened there? And then turning to Sports. Bob, you mentioned the confidence of getting the NBA for a long-term contract. But I guess everybody is expecting that you'll pay a lot more, probably get fewer games. Is there any comment that you can give us on your outlook for profitability with the new contract? And will the inclusion of the NBA negotiations open the door to strategic investment? \nRobert Iger: Sure. I'll take that. Thanks for the question, Jessica. I think that was 2 questions, parts A through E if I captured it correctly. In terms of advertising, generally speaking, the advertising market is pretty healthy right now as we head into the upfront. Certainly, live and sports are playing out very well. And in addition to that, we feel good about the offering we have, particularly in terms of the premium offerings that we have, both in sports as well as with the Disney+ offering.\n The challenge, obviously, in the advertising market right now is there's a lot more supply in the market, largely as a result of one of our competitors entering the ad tier. But that said, I think generally speaking, we feel like we're in a better place than we were a year ago, and we have healthy momentum across nearly all the categories. Auto may be one exception and maybe to some degree, electronics as well. But by and large, demand is out there, and it's pretty high.\n So we lap our way out of the supply increase, I think we're going to be in a good spot as we enter next year. Password sharing beginning next month, in very select markets. We're starting to go after people who are sharing passwords improperly. And that will roll out in earnest or across the globe in September. We feel quite bullish about it. Obviously, we're heartened by the results that Netflix has delivered in their password sharing initiative and believe that it will be one of the contributors to growth, as you noted, going forward.\n I think it's also important to note, look, Netflix is, in many respects, the gold standard when it comes to streaming. But what I mean by that is if you look at programming, we stack up really well. We have a great lineup and quality of programming across not just ESPN and Disney+, but also Hulu. What we're building is the technology that Netflix has had in place and has been building for well over a decade to improve the business from a bottom line perspective. And that starts with password sharing, but it's all the things that Hugh mentioned as well.\n So I feel good about this being a necessary and very, very productive next step in terms of rolling out the technology that we need to get to the double-digit margins that he has talked about. Lastly, in terms of the NBA, I'm really not going to comment about profitability or about the cost of the package except to say, as we've said before, we continue to look at the NBA, not only as a premium sports product but is a sports product that has growth ahead of it. Obviously, with great demographics. We feel really good about the potential package that we will end up with in terms of it basically enabling ESPN to continue to shine in the television sports business.\n And I think it would be -- I won't say anything more about it at this point. If and when there's an announcement, we'll give more details. \nHugh Johnston: And then last on your question around the timing on ESPN+ subscriptions. That's normal seasonality. That's one of the challenges when you look at things from 1 quarter to the next, the seasonality tends to get ignored, but the end of college football season, we do typically see a decline. So nothing out of the ordinary there. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Fishman with MoffettNathanson. \nRobert Fishman: One for Bob and one for Hugh, if I can. Bob, back to sports, just maybe more broadly, as you think about which sports rights to invest in, how important is securing global rights to drive the international growth for ESPN or even Disney+ as part of your analysis to drive returns to combat the sports rights increases?\n And then for Hugh, as a follow-up to the theatrical slate that Bob was speaking about before, can you just help investors think about the Disney studio profit potential and success and maybe even relative to pre-COVID peak levels? \nRobert Iger: I'll start on the sports question. We have selective rights -- international rights for sports of the sports properties that we've licensed largely for the United States. We also have an array of sports rights in Latin America, many of them came with the acquisition of 20th Century Fox. We're being selective about adding international rights right now where possible, where the opportunity exists, we're doing so. But we're not investing heavily at this point in growing international rights, except again, where we can buy them along with the rights that we're licensing for the United States.\n It's an opportunity for us to plant the seeds of more growth for ESPN outside the United States, but we're walking before we run in that regard. \nHugh Johnston: And then, Robert, to answer your question about studio profitability, as I look back, studio profitability has got some cyclicality to it. And we certainly feel very good about the upcoming slate. That business should get back to profitability, and we certainly feel good about it being a healthy, profitable business over time. Beyond that, I don't want to get into quarterly guidance on a subcomponent of one of our segments. So it's just getting a little bit too low into the details. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. \nKannan Venkateshwar: In terms of the theme park business, maybe Hugh or Bob, if you could talk about the growth framework, which anchors your CapEx plan, it's obviously a pretty significant plan over the next decade. And the business has grown over mid-single digits for a very long period of time. How much upside do you see to this trajectory over the investment horizon?\n And then, Bob, from a succession planning perspective, you've obviously been highly engaged with the Board on this. Could you talk about what your goal is in terms of the hand off? What do you hope to achieve in your tenure before the next CEO takes over? \nHugh Johnston: Okay. I'll take the first one. Regarding the investment in the parks, you know the financials of that business well. It's a 25-plus margin business and has been for an extended period of time, has terrifically high guest satisfaction scores, which create layers of advantage, would suggest we should be able to sustain high margins and high returns on investment. With the business with that profile, you invest in it. We know there are lots of opportunities to continue to grow attendance, both domestically and internationally.\n And the cruise business, frankly, is one that has an enormous number of opportunities for us over time. And that is why we're leaning, we're heavily into that business. So we're not investing capital, obviously, to achieve poor returns. We expect to get excellent returns out of the business, in particular in cruises, given the margin profile of the business, and the fact that it's got the highest guest satisfaction scores in the company. This leads just to conclude, this is a business with a lot of runway left in it, and that will deliver great returns to our shareholders. \nRobert Iger: Regarding succession, Kannan, as we've said before, the Board is heavily engaged in the process and has appointed a succession planning committee that is meeting on a regular basis to not just discuss, but also to manage the process, I'm confident that they will choose the right person at the right time. And that to the extent that I can, we'll participate in the smooth transition. \nOperator: Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. \nJohn Hodulik: Bob, engagement on Disney+ has been declining a bit based on the Nielsen gauge data, although I guess it's ticked up a bit here recently at Hulu. But ESPN tile definitely makes sense, but can you talk about efforts to boost viewership on the platform, including the revamp of the technology and maybe the UI that you referenced last quarter? When should we expect to see these benefits or that technology rolled out? Anything you can tell us about engagement for users on the new combined Disney+ Hulu platform?\n So that's one, I guess, with multiple parts. And then following up on ESPN+, again, you lost subs again this quarter. What's the plan for that service once the flagship platform is launched next fall? \nHugh Johnston: John, I'm happy to talk about engagement a little bit on the platform. As I mentioned earlier, the things that we believe drive engagement and still represents significant incremental opportunity for us is number one, programming, having terrific programming is obviously the leading factor. And with what we've been introducing recently, whether it's Shogun, whether it's The Bear over the next couple of years on the TV side. And obviously, the terrific movie slate that's right in front of us. \n As we window it into the streaming service, we think that's going to do great things for engagement. In addition to that, things like recommendation engines, obviously, increase engagement because people are getting more of a sense of what it is that they want to watch based on the suggestions that we make. In addition to that, we do see bundling as an opportunity. Sports bundling, which is why we're putting the ESPN Taiwan. In Latin America, we're combining all into the Disney+ app. Again, all this is geared towards driving engagement.\n So overall, you can be confident we've got laser focused on driving engagement because we know it leads to subscriber satisfaction and it leads to lower churn over time. \nAlexia Quadrani: And John, your second question was about our strategy for ESPN+ once we launch flagship? Was that the question? \nJohn Hodulik: Yes, exactly. I mean is that going to remain a separate service sort of alongside the sort of full blown ESPN streaming service once that's launched next year? \nRobert Iger: The plan is if you buy ESPN flagship, then you'll get all the ESPN+ programming in it. If you do not want that, then you can buy ESPN+ on its own. In addition, if you -- our current plan is that with the tile that we're putting on, the combined Disney+ Hulu app, the ESPN tile, you'll be able -- if you're an ESPN+ subscriber, you'll be able to get ESPN+ through that tile. \nOperator: Our next question comes from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. \nDavid Karnovsky: Maybe following up on the studio commentary from earlier. As you noted, your upcoming slate is a number of sequels and that's a strategy where you've had a lot of success in the past. But as you look out over the medium term, how do you think about the balance of leaning on established franchises versus investment in new IP? And then separately, when we look at your summer releases, there are several films from 20th Century Fox IP. So I wanted to see what opportunity you think there is to bring more titles from the Fox library to the forefront? \nRobert Iger: We're going to balance sequels with originals, particularly in animation. We had gone through a period where our original films in animation, both Disney and Pixar were dominating. We're now swinging back a bit to lean on sequels. And so we've talked, as you know, about Toy Story and obviously, Inside Out this summer. I just think that right now, given the competition and the overall movie marketplace that actually, there's a lot of value in sequels, obviously, because they're known, and it takes less in terms of marketing.\n In terms of Marvel specifically, it implies there too. We actually have both Thunderbolts as if for instance, is coming up in 2025 as an original. And then, of course, we mentioned Deadpool this summer, which is a sequel. And I talked about Avengers and Captain America is coming out in 2025. It will just be a balance, which we think is right. \n In terms of 20th Century Fox, we continue to look at the library to see what can be mined. I mentioned Alien earlier. We talked about Avatar 3, which is coming, obviously, Planet of the Apes where there might be more opportunity pending the success of the film to do more. I don't think we'll necessarily lean into the library, but we'll continue to look opportunistically at it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Morris at Guggenheim. \nMichael Morris: Two questions. First, can you expand or give us an update on the charter partnership. You mentioned a couple of times. I know it was the first quarter of that kind of new relationship or at least new structure. So the questions are, how did that subscriber base perform from an engagement perspective? How was churn? Did the quarter reflect the full impact at this point from a financial perspective? And is this a template that you do expect to use more frequently going forward?\n So that's the first topic. And then second, I wanted to ask about licensing content. And what your view is or your updated view of licensing your content off-platform? What the growth opportunity is there and whether you kind of look at the so-called Netflix effect is something you could benefit from by licensing off platform or whether you want to create that effect yourselves on your own platform and keep content in-house? \nHugh Johnston: Yes. I'll take the first question on this. Look, it's very early days, obviously, in terms of the Charter deal. During the quarter, it was only in place for a couple of months. That said, we're happy with it so far. We obviously have gotten added subscribers. And in addition to that, cannibalization has not been very high. And overall, the engagement has been good. So as for it being a template for the future, I don't think I would go to that level. Each of these deals in many ways has to be architected to the specific needs of the partner as well as our needs.\n So I don't think I would think of it as a template for the future, but it's been a successful deal for us and for Charter. So we feel good about it. \nRobert Iger: We are already doing some licensing with Netflix, and we're looking selectively at other possibilities. I don't want to declare that it's a direction will go more aggressively or not, but we certainly are taking a look at it and being expansive in our thinking about it. We had previously thought that exclusivity, meaning our own product and our own platforms had huge value. It does -- definitely does have some value.\n But as you know, we're also watching as some studios of licensed content to third-party streamers, and that then creates more traction, more awareness. In effect, increases not only the value of the content from a financial perspective, but just in terms of traction. So we're looking at it with an open mind. But I don't think you should expect that we'll do a significant amount of it. \nAlexia Quadrani: Okay. Thanks for the questions, and I want to thank everyone for joining us today.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Alexia Quadrani, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Quadrani : Good afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome everybody to The Walt Disney Company's first quarter 2024 earnings call. Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay and transcript as well as the first quarter earnings presentation will all be made available on our website after the call. Joining me for today's call are Bob Iger, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Hugh, we'll be happy to take some of your questions. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.\nBob Iger : Thanks, Alexia, and good afternoon, everyone. Just one year ago, we outlined an ambitious plan to return to a period of sustained growth and shareholder value creation. And our strong performance this past quarter demonstrates we have turned the corner and entered a new era. As previously noted, we're focused on transitioning ESPN into the preeminent digital sports platform, building streaming into a profitable growth business, reinvigorating our film studios and turbocharging growth in our parks and experiences.  Before we dive deeper into our results, let me start by making a number of significant announcements that represent important and exciting steps forward. First, we announced yesterday the full suite of ESPN's channels will now be available direct-to-consumer as part of a new joint venture with Fox and Warner Brothers Discovery to create a new streaming sports service launching this fall. This brings together content from all of these companies' combined assets, including all the major professional sports leagues and college sports.  And in the fall of 2025, we'll be offering ESPN as a stand-alone streaming option with innovative digital features, creating a one-stop sports destination unlike anything available in the marketplace today. ESPN is also adding a sports icon to its lineup with Coach Nick Saban joining the network as an on-air commentator later this year. We're excited to share that in November, we will release a feature-length animated sequel to Moana, which joins a very robust lineup of upcoming theatrical releases. We're also thrilled to share that we're entering into an exciting relationship with Epic Games, acquiring a small equity stake and launching a groundbreaking new games and entertainment universe that brings together Disney's beloved brands and franchises with the hugely popular Fortnite. And I'm pleased to share that Disney's board has declared an additional dividend and will be embarking on a $3 billion stock buyback program in fiscal '24. And one more thing. Next month, ESPN+ will become the exclusive streaming home of Taylor Swift's historic concert film, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, Taylor's Version. I'll be sharing more with you about these announcements momentarily, but what's clear is that the important transformation we undertook last year is bearing fruit. And looking at our results this quarter, we can say with confidence our strategy is working. In Q1, segment operating income increased by 27%, and adjusted earnings per share rose 23% compared to prior year.  We've improved our entertainment streaming operating income by a remarkable 86% year-over-year and remain poised to reach profitability in our on streaming business by the end of fiscal '24 and build on our momentum to deliver significant sustained profit margins in the future. Disney's experiences business generated all-time records in revenue, operating income and operating margin. And we are on track to meet or exceed $7.5 billion in cost savings as we continue to look for further efficiency opportunities across the company. Diving deeper into our announcements, let's first talk about ESPN, which continues to deliver meaningfully for the company and will be a key value driver in the future. ESPN's domestic sports business continues to grow and even amid a challenging linear landscape, ESPN increased its overall audience in calendar year 2023, and it continues to break records in ratings. Ultimately, our mission is to make ESPN into the preeminent digital sports brand, reaching as many sports fans as possible and giving them even more ways to access the programming they love in whatever way best suits their needs. One way will be through the new streaming sports service coming this fall that we announced yesterday in conjunction with Fox and Warner Brothers. Discovery. This service will bring together our collective portfolios of sports channels and direct-to-consumer services on a non-exclusive basis, providing consumers with more of the sports they want in a single place. It's important for us to serve the needs of consumers looking for a seamless way to access an aggregated collection of sports-centric content, including capturing fans moving away from the full cable and satellite bundle. And it's an attractive business proposition for ESPN, allowing us to command per unit economics in line with established market rates for our sports content, just like we do with any streaming or linear service where we offer our programming. Another exciting option available to sports fans will come in the fall of 2025, when we make the full suite of ESPN's channels available as a standalone and highly interactive digital destination. Not only will consumers be able to stream their favorite live games and studio programming, they'll also have access to engaging digital integrations like ESPN Bet and Fantasy Sports, e-commerce features and a deep array of sports stats, all of which we know will be incredibly compelling to younger sports fans in particular. It will also have very robust personalization features. ESPN has long prioritized its desire and ability to serve sports fans wherever they are, and these steps will strengthen ESPN's ability to deliver on that promise.  And as you know, we've also engaged in productive conversations with potential content and marketing partners for ESPN. We've made progress towards securing deals, and we expect to have more to share with you in the near future. We're excited to offer a more unified streaming experience, which we expect will deliver strong benefits in terms of higher engagement, lower churn and greater advertising potential. When we launch our stand-alone ESPN service, we will also make it available on Disney+ for bundled subscribers just as we've done for Hulu. We've already seen an incredible response to the beta launch of Hulu on Disney+, which has far exceeded every metric, and we're looking forward to the full launch next month. This is all part of the ambitious streaming strategy we've been building: From our acquisition of 21st Century Fox that expanded our vast content library and strong pool of creative talent, to the launch of Disney+ at home to a century of content, to securing full control of Hulu and expanding our streaming offerings to reach greater audiences, to our significant investments in technology, and now taking significant steps toward ESPN's streaming future. Disney also has a great advertising story to tell with unparalleled scale and very strong advertising technology, and our ad-supported Disney+ offering is off to a great start. We successfully expanded outside the U.S. with launches in EMEA and Canada and grew to over 1,000 global advertisers in the first quarter. That's a tenfold increase from launch. More than anything, the success of our streaming services is a testament to the amazing content we create with six of the top 10 most streamed movies across all streaming platforms in the U.S. in 2023. Our best-in-class storytelling continues to entertain millions of people.  We received 27 Golden Globe nominations and won top prizes for FX's The Bear and Searchlight's Poor Things. At this year's Primetime Emmy Awards, we took home 37 wins, more than any other entertainment company. And we lead the industry with 20 nominations heading into the Oscars, which will air on March 10 on ABC. We're also proud of our recent Disney-branded programming successes. Percy Jackson and the Olympians, which premiered on both Disney+ and Hulu in December, has become a bonafide hit. Books from the series returned to the number one slot on The New York Times Best Seller list following the debut of the Disney+ series, and I'm thrilled to share that we just picked up a second season.  And the hit children's animated series, Bluey, which is exclusive to the Disney Channel and Disney+ in the United States was recently the number one most streamed show across any streaming platform. Looking ahead, we have an exciting slate of originals coming to Disney+, including Agatha from Marvel Studios, Skeleton Crew and The Acolyte from Lucasfilm, Win or Lose from Pixar and much more.  Additionally, later this month, Hulu will launch FX's highly anticipated Saga Shogun in the U.S. In March, all seasons of Grey's Anatomy, our number one streamed title globally, will join our extensive library of titles on Hulu. When the show returns next month for its 20th season, Hulu will be the only place to see the current and all previous seasons of this truly iconic series. And speaking of icons, over the past year, we've all witnessed the creative genius and sheer power of a true cultural phenomenon, Taylor Swift. When her blockbuster concert film debuts on Disney+ on March 15, it will feature the concert in its entirety, including the song Cardigan and four additional acoustic songs which were not in the theatrical or digital purchase release of the film. We know audience are going to absolutely love the chance to relieve the electrifying Taylor Swift: Eras Tour Taylor's Version whenever they want on Disney+. Turning to our film studios. We have an incredibly robust slate of new releases as we continue revitalizing our creativity. Just consider the lineup of titles we will release through the end of 2026. This year, we have Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, Inside Out 2, Deadpool 3, Alien: Romulus and Mufasa: The Lion King. As I mentioned at the top of the call, this November, we'll release a feature-length animated sequel to Moana. This was originally developed as a series, but we were impressed with what we saw, and we knew it deserved a theatrical release. The original Moana film from 2016 recently crossed 1 billion hours streamed on Disney+ and was the most streamed movie of 2023 on any platform in the U.S. Along with the live-action version of the original film that's currently in development, Moana remains an incredibly popular franchise, and we can't wait to give you more of Ohana and Maui when Moana 2 comes to theaters this November. Looking to our 2025 theatrical slate, we're excited to bring audiences Captain America: Brave New World, Fantastic 4, Pixar's Elio, Zootopia 2 and Avatar 3. And we're already looking forward to 2026 and beyond with Frozen 3, the first Toy Story movie since 2019, new Star Wars movie that brings The Mandalorian and Grogu to the big screen for the very first time. These films will not only reach global audiences and theaters, but as we consistently demonstrated, they will become important anchors on our global streaming platforms, driving subscriptions and engagement while also continuing to fuel growth in our experiences business.  After all, one of the things that truly sets Disney apart is our unique ability to turn top-quality IP into top-quality experiences, leading to significant growth. That was certainly true this quarter. Every one of our parks was profitable in Q1, giving us an incredibly solid foundation to build upon as we invest significantly to turbocharge growth in this business.  We've had a tremendous response from guests visiting our newly opened World of Frozen at Hong Kong Disneyland as well as our first-ever Zootopia Land at Shanghai Disney Resort. And as I've said before, we also have so many untapped stories just waiting to be brought to life in our parks across the globe as we continue to invest in this extraordinary business. But it's not just our parks where we're creating new opportunities for consumers to engage with the characters and franchises they love. Our new relationship with Epic Games will create a transformational games and entertainment universe that integrates Disney's world-class storytelling into Epic's cultural phenomenon, Fortnite, enabling consumers to play, watch, create and shop for both digital and physical goods.  This marks Disney's biggest entry ever into the world of video games and offers significant opportunities for growth and expansion. The new immersive universe will allow fans to unleash their own creativity and experience the Disney stories in worlds that they love in groundbreaking new ways. Younger audiences in particular are huge consumers of video games. In fact, among millennials, Gen Z and Gen Alpha, a significant amount of time spent on screen-based platforms is playing video games. This new universe from Disney and Epic provides us with a tremendous opportunity to not only meet more consumers where they are, but to allow more audiences to cultivate a bond with Disney's iconic brands and franchises, including Marvel, Star Wars and much more. Looking at the renewed strength of our businesses this quarter from sports to entertainment to experiences, the stage is now set for significant growth and success. In that regard, we see ample opportunity to increase shareholder returns as our earnings and free cash flow continue to grow. Our current position of strength and confidence in our path ahead already led us to pay a dividend to our shareholders last month. And I'm pleased to share that the board declared that our next semi-annual dividend to be paid in July will be 50% higher versus the last dividend paid in January. The board has also authorized the company to begin repurchasing shares for the first time since fiscal 2018, and we plan to start by targeting $3 billion this fiscal year. As we continue to invest in our growth businesses and maintain our strong balance sheet, we also expect to prioritize dividend payments and share repurchases in the coming years.  I'm proud of our company's remarkable achievements, and I'm grateful to a deep bench of seasoned executives who are helping guide Disney into the future. And that includes Hugh Johnston, our new CFO, who has already proven to be an outstanding addition to the team. We feel very fortunate to have Hugh with us. And now to take you through more of our results this quarter, I'll turn things over to Hugh.\nHugh Johnston : Thanks, Bob. I joined Disney a little over two months ago. And the more I learned about this incredible company, the more excited I am about the opportunities ahead of us. I'm looking forward to continuing to partner with Bob and our management team as we execute on our strategy with the goal of delivering significant consistent long-term earnings and free cash flow growth. We are very pleased with this quarter's financial results. Fiscal first quarter diluted earnings per share excluding certain items increased by 23% versus the prior year to $1.22, and segment operating margin increased by 350 basis points, reflecting both strong pricing and operating expense reductions. Both revenue and operating income at direct-to-consumer, domestic ESPN and experiences all increased versus the prior year. And operating income across each of our business segments grew nicely, in part due to the diligent and ongoing cost efficiency work we're driving throughout our businesses as evidenced by the realization of over $500 million in SG&A and other operating expense savings across the enterprise in the first quarter. Moving to our results by segment. At entertainment, first quarter operating income more than doubled driven by significant improvement at direct-to-consumer. Entertainment direct-to-consumer operating income improved by about $850 million versus the prior year and by nearly $300 million versus Q4. And revenue increased sequentially by over 10%, benefiting from higher subscription and advertising revenue.  Operating income in the first quarter was better than the guidance the company gave in the last earnings call primarily due to expense favorability. Hulu subscribers increased by 1.2 million from Q4 to Q1, and Disney+ core subscribers decreased sequentially by 1.3 million, in line with prior guidance, driven by the expected temporary uptick in churn given the recent domestic price increases as well as the end of the global summer promotion. Those impacts were partially offset by strong ad tier net adds due to domestic growth as well as the launch in certain international markets in the first quarter. Domestically, we saw continued net additions to our bundled offerings in Q1, which, as a reminder, has significantly lower churn versus our standalone products.  Disney+ core ARPU increased by $0.14 versus the prior quarter and by $1.07 versus the prior year driven primarily by price increases. We expect Disney+ core ARPU to increase in the second quarter due to the continued benefit of price increases, which should only be partially offset by the impact of adding Charter's Spectrum TV Select subs to the Disney+ ad tier. I'll note that we are being paid on all entitled Charter subs, which will also be a key driver of accelerated Disney+ core sub growth in Q2.  We expect net adds of between 5.5 million and 6 million in the second quarter. Domestic net adds are expected to be in the 7.5 million range driven by Charter entitlements net of cannibalization. And international core subs are expected to decrease modestly, reflecting changes to certain wholesale deals and slightly elevated churn impacts from price increases. While subscriber growth will vary from quarter-to-quarter, we are confident in our prospects for ongoing sub growth over the longer term driven by the continued global strength of our content slate; advancing our paid sharing efforts; technology advances that are intended to improve our content promotion and discovery capabilities, drive up engagement and lower churn; the impact of making Hulu content available on Disney+ for bundled subs; and continued adoption of the bundle domestically, which should both increase engagement and lower churn, a strategy we will repeat in Latin America this summer when we combine Disney+ and Star+; and our continued use of tiering to provide subscribers with more choices. As it relates to the opportunity we see on paid sharing, beginning this summer, Disney+ accounts suspected of improper sharing will be presented with new capabilities to allow their borrowers to start their own subscriptions. Later this calendar year, account holders who want to allow access to individuals from outside their household will be able to add them to their accounts for an additional fee.  While we are still in the early days and don't expect notable benefits from these paid-sharing initiatives until the back half of calendar 2024, we want to reach as large an audience as possible with our outstanding content, and we're looking forward to rolling out this new functionality to improve the overall customer experience and grow our subscriber base. For Q2, we are expecting revenue at entertainment DTC to grow sequentially and anticipate that operating losses will be relatively in line with the first quarter. We still expect to reach profitability at our combined streaming businesses in Q4 of fiscal 2024 and have never been more confident about our path to creating a strong and sustainable streaming business with growing subscribers over the long term, and ultimately, double-digit operating margins, a business which we fully expect to be a key earnings growth driver for the company. Moving on to entertainment linear networks. The decrease in the first quarter operating income versus the prior year was due to lower advertising and affiliate revenues, partially offset by lower programming and production costs. Lower domestic advertising revenue was driven primarily by lower impressions, including from strike related impacts in addition to an adverse comparison to the prior year midterm-related political advertising at our owned stations. Domestic entertainment affiliate revenue decreased by 5% in the first quarter versus the prior year as a five-point benefit from higher rates was more than offset by a 10-point decline from fewer subscribers. Adjusted for the non-carriage of certain networks at Charter as a result of our recent deal, the sub decline impact was closer to 7%.  Lower programming and production costs benefited from strike related impacts, and we also remain focused on driving ongoing cost efficiencies. At content sales, licensing and other results came in lower versus the prior year and below the guidance we provided due to the performance of theatrical titles in the quarter. We do not have any new key theatrical releases in Q2 due to production delays stemming from the strikes and expect content sales, licensing and other operating income to come in roughly breakeven for the quarter. Sports operating income improved versus the prior year due to strength at ESPN, partially offset by lower results at Star India driven by higher rights costs from airing of the ICC Cricket World Cup. At domestic ESPN, year-over-year growth was driven largely by a decrease in programming production costs from the timing of college football playoff games. Domestic affiliate revenue in Q1 was comparable to the prior year as an increase of 6% from higher contractual rates was offset by a commensurate decrease from fewer subscribers.  ESPN domestic ad sales in the quarter were down 2% versus the prior year but up mid-single digits when adjusted for various timing shifts and onetime impacts. The strength we are seeing gives us confidence that leaning into sports will continue to create value for our shareholders. Second quarter to date, we are seeing continued healthy advertising demand in the sports marketplace with domestic ESPN cash ad sales pacing up double digit percentage points versus the prior year. The trend is still solid even when adjusted for the CFP timing shift of an additional game as well as an extra NFL divisional game in Q2 this year. Our experiences business posted strong Q1 results with year-over-year operating income growth of 10% at parks and experiences and 4% at consumer products. Record setting results this quarter were primarily driven by our performance at Shanghai and Hong Kong theme parks, continued strength at Disney Cruise Line and the success of Marvel's Spider Man 2 at our games business. And segment margins expanded by over 50 basis points versus the prior year, an achievement delivered despite tough comparisons at Walt Disney World coming off its highly successful 50th anniversary celebration in the prior year and significant cost pressures driven by wage increases. We remain optimistic about the segment's continued top line and profit growth, notwithstanding the tough comps domestically in Q2, and we still expect robust OI growth at experiences for the full year. We plan to invest approximately $60 billion into the business over the next 10 years, of which approximately 70% is earmarked for incremental capacity expanding investments around the globe, which we expect to generate attractive returns. On a total company basis, as Bob mentioned earlier, we are still on pace to meet or exceed our $7.5 billion annualized cost target by the end of fiscal 2024. I'm pleased with how this is tracking so far. Total expenses in Q1 were down 4% versus the prior year, and the efficiencies we've been realizing are a key contributor to that progress. And we are also still on track to generate about $8 billion in free cash flow this fiscal year. Putting all this together, we are confident in the progress we are making and the path it puts us on to become a strong cash generator and earnings compounder starting in fiscal 2024.  To that end, we expect full year fiscal 2024 earnings per share excluding certain items to increase by at least 20% versus 2023 to approximately $4.60. You already heard from Bob about our updated plans for shareholder returns this year. And as he mentioned, we intend to continue investing in our growth businesses while also maintaining a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation. And with that, we're happy to take your questions.\nAlexia Quadrani : Thank you. As we transition to a Q&A, we ask that you please try limit yourself to one question in order to help us get as many analysts as possible today. And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne : Thank you. Good afternoon. You guys had a lot of news for us to chew on tonight. I wanted to maybe start, Bob, asking you about sports since you led with that. You guys have a lot going on with ESPN, new channels package, flagship, obviously having conversations. Can you kind of put it all into context for us? And how you're sort of thinking about these different products and whether they address different parts of the market and what your sort of priorities are between the two? And really, what are we -- what is success for Disney shareholders in sport? How do we think about that kind of financially and strategically?  And I was just wondering if you had an update for us on expense growth this year. I think you guys guided to slight growth overall in '24 last quarter. It seems like you're on track with your savings program. So any update to that would be appreciated. Thanks so much. \nBob Iger : Thanks, Ben. Permit me to throw a couple of cliches your way. But as you know, ESPN has always aimed to serve the sportsman effectively no matter where the sports fan is. And so all of the steps that we've been taking and that we announced today and that we will continue to take are aimed at doing just that.  And when you think about today's environment where you've obviously got some challenges in linear TV, a lot more competition, both for people's time and just specifically in sports, and you think about the fact that ESPN finished '23 in really good shape, ratings continue to rise. Sports is still an advertiser's delight.  You have to consider that ESPN has been successful in what their primary goal was. They're reaching sports fans effectively, which is why advertisers and distributors and sports leagues and organizations feel they have to kind of be part of or partnered with ESPN. As we look to the future, we're obviously mindful of, one, the state of the multichannel ecosystem; two, where people are spending their time and their money with media. And you have to basically serve them effectively there.  We've been saying for a long time that taking ESPN in the direct-to-consumer direction was inevitable and that we were looking for partners to do so. This is really not a first step, it's a second step. The first step was launching ESPN+ some years ago, which has actually been quite successful.  The second step is finding these partners to distribute basically the equivalent of a multi-channel, sports-centric tier via app. So one, we're serving sports fans well. Two, we're doing it with partners. Three, we're doing it in a more modern way rather than cable and satellite in this case, it's app-based.  And that's a big step for us because we know that there are a number of people who have never signed up for multi-channel television. This gives them a chance to do so at a price point that will be obviously more attractive than the big fat bundle. Two, there are people who have left that ecosystem because they didn't want all those channels or that cost. And this is a way of basically preserving a relationship or creating one with those that are no longer part of the multi-channel ecosystem. The next step after this, and we announced today that we'll launch it in probably August of '25, is to bring out ESPN flagship. I say on its own, but it will be bundled ultimately with Hulu and Disney+. And that will be a very, very immersive, very obviously sports-centric app, which will have features that this combination with Fox and with Time Warner Discovery will not have, such as integrated betting, integrated fantasy, likely to have some sales arm or merchandise capabilities. Obviously, deep dive into stats and high degree of customization and personalization. Again, another kind of feature that we'll bring out to engage with sports fans. I can't tell you right now how that ultimately will fit into all of this, except it will be a progression. We haven't really talked much about how it will be further -- how it will be bundled except with our own services. But I think success will be, for us, in this basically migration would be to maintain ESPN's position in sports in general and the affinity that its fans have with ESPN and the attractiveness of ESPN to advertisers and sports leagues. That simple.\nHugh Johnston : Right. I'll take the cost side, Ben. You're right, in the past, we've talked about slight growth in operating expenses year-over-year. We obviously have terrific momentum on cost management coming out of the first quarter. And the team is relentlessly looking for further opportunities to drive cost savings, both to reinvest back in the business to continue the growth momentum that we have as well as deliver margin growth to the bottom line.  Net, no change in guidance versus what we said previously. We should do at least as well as the guidance we previously committed to, which was slight growth in operating expenses year-over-year.\nAlexia Quadrani : Thanks, Ben. Operator, next question please?\nOperator: Absolutely. Our next question today comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nathanson : Hi. One for you, Bob, one for you, Hugh. Bob, in answer to Ben's question, we're still kind of wondering, how does Hulu Live fit into the long-term picture here, right? It stopped growing. YouTube is twice the size. When you think about the future of your offerings, how does that fit into what you just announced with direct over-the-top ESPN and then sports bundle? And then for Hugh, you broke some news, too, with a double-digit margin target for streaming. Any help on a timetable that gets us there? Or what factors do you think will drive you from here to double digits in the next couple of years? Thanks.\nBob Iger : As you know, Hulu Live is more reflects the bigger, fatter bundle of television channels of -- like many other services that are out there. It just happens to be integrated or attached to Hulu if you subscribe to it.  So this, in a way, I guess, you'd argue, competes with Hulu Live directly, but it doesn't compete with Hulu because this will be bundled with Hulu. So if you're a Hulu subscriber and you want to get this new sports service, you can buy that as an add-on to Hulu. And as we see it, that's a real positive because if you consider the fact that Disney+ and Hulu will be together once we come out of beta in March already together in beta, and then you add a sports feature with so many sports that this new joint venture will offer, that's very, very compelling in terms of reducing churn for Hulu and increasing engagement.  So we look at this as a huge positive for Hulu. We're realistic about Hulu Live in terms of the impact this could have, but that Hulu Live is certainly a nice, important feature of our Hulu business, but the critical part of that business is Hulu itself.\nHugh Johnston : And Michael, I'll take the question on DTC profitability in double digit. Yeah, I know we -- for the first time, we put out that our objective is to get to double-digit margins. In some ways, it probably shouldn't be a surprise to investors because the goal has always been to build what I would characterize as a good business. What does a good business look like? Number one, it's got growing; and number two, it has attractive margins, which we're defining as double digits. So I know in a sense it's news, but in a sense, it shouldn't be news because we've always wanted to build a good business in that regard. In terms of how we get there, it's really in many ways the way that we've gotten from where we were to the point we're at right now. Number one, we're going to grow subscribers. Number two, you'll see some level of pricing. And both of those things will probably be similar to what you've seen over the last couple of years, maybe a slightly different balance but roughly similar. And then we'll actually get some leverage out of marketing spend, content and technology spend. All of those will grow a little bit less -- at a lesser rate than the rate of revenue growth. In terms of the specifics on how do we get there with sub growth, I think it will be a couple of things. Number one, paid sharing is an opportunity for us. It's one that our competitor has obviously taken advantage of and one that sits in front of us. And we've got some very specific actions that we're taking in the next couple of months, which I discussed earlier, which will benefit us to some degree in the back half of this year and very much next year. Number two, we'll see lower churn with the bundles that we're looking to put out. Number three, international remains a growth opportunity for us. So if you put all of those pieces together, it's kind of doing a lot of what we've been doing with maybe some slightly different tactics to get to a level that, again, we would characterize as a good business. Not going to put a specific time frame on that right now. Some of that is going to be driven by the marketplace. Just know that we feel a sense of urgency in getting there, and that's probably the way we're going to operate the business. We'll feel urgency, but only to get to a good, sustainable business.\nAlexia Quadrani : Thank you. Operator the next question please?\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich : Thank you. You guys covered so much ground tonight. So I have one question and two follow-ups. You announced -- or Hugh, for the first time, I've heard you say this that in parks, 70% of the $60 billion in CapEx that you outlined over the next 10 years, like -- I'm sorry, that 70% of that will go to incremental capacity, so like over $40 billion in new parks and attractions. Can you give us some color on timing and location? There's been speculation that you may open a fifth gate in Florida. And then just a follow-up to a couple of things you said. One on paid sharing crackdown, which came up twice. Have you sized the number of borrowers? And on the sports JV, how do you plan to attract non-pay TV subs to what sounds like it might be an expensive sports service without a significant decrease in traditional pay TV subs who would actually save money? Like how do you not cannibalize?\nBob Iger : Okay. You asked a lot of questions on a lot of different subjects. I'll take the first one on park's timing and location. We're already hard at work at basically determining where we're going to place our new investments and what they will be. You can pretty much conclude that they'll be all over, meaning every single one of our locations will be the beneficiary of increased investment and thus increased capacity, including on the High Seas, where we're currently building three more ships. And in a business that is obviously, extremely positive to us, we may look expansively, at least in the next decade in that direction. I'm not going to really give you much more of a sense of timing, except that we're hard at work at getting these things basically conceived and built. And we've got a menu of things that will basically start opening in '25, and there'll be a cadence every year of additional -- basically additional investment and increase capacity.  I'll let Hugh take care of the paid sharing. Hugh?\nHugh Johnston : Yeah.\nBob Iger : On the sports service and the pricing, I think the way you have to look at it is the sports service is going to be substantially less expensive to consumers than the big bundle that they'd have to buy to get those same channels on cable and satellite. And again, designed for two things. One, we believe there are a number of sports fans out there that want to watch sports on television but didn't want to sign up to the big cable and satellite bundle. And so we think they will be accretive to us. We also believe that either consumers have left the bundle because it wasn't serving them well or they may leave the bundle, and we want to make sure that we grab them, too. So we view this whole thing as, one, being a good proposition for sports fans because of the cost and certainly being positive for us because of the dynamics in the marketplace right now.\nHugh Johnston : Okay. And Jessica, I'll handle the paid sharing question. We have sized it. I don't want to put a specific number out there right now because these numbers are obviously rough estimates anyway. Suffice to say that the opportunity that we see on a percentage basis probably isn't all that dramatically different from what our competitor has found in terms of their subscriber base. In terms of getting at it, there's a couple of actions that we've taken in order to do that. Number one, we have some -- made some changes to the user language that we have in the U.S., Canada and certain markets so that we'll actually have the opportunity to act on the paid sharing opportunity. Number two, the accounts that we think are doing unpaid sharing right now will get communication this summer, and we'll give them opportunities to allow their borrowers to start new subscriptions. And then later this year, we'll actually also have account holders who want to allow further individuals to access their accounts from outside that they'll be able to access the account, but they'll be able to do so for an additional fee. So we've got a number of tactical actions to take in order to take advantage of what we think is a pretty good sized opportunity in front of us. And it's one of the things that gives us confidence in our subscriber growth numbers.\nAlexia Quadrani : Thank you. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nSteven Cahall : Thank you. So Bob, you mentioned a lot of content in your remarks. It seems like the operations are really starting to hum again. But I think the lifeblood of the company is always going to be the studio output. It drives so much culture. I think that's an area you've said that you've been spending a lot of time on. Do you feel like the content is also now turning the corner like you've seen in the operations? And if so, when do you think we might see some of the results of that renewed focus on the studio output? And then, Hugh, I think the inevitable question with the buyback announcement is what you expect you might end up ultimately paying for Hulu. Just wondering if you have any sense on the timing of that outcome or situation. And related to that, I think the exceed $7.5 billion in savings was a bit new. Curious just where you found those extra buckets of cost savings. Thank you.\nBob Iger : Steven, I feel great about where we are with the studio. Let's not lose sight of the fact that in the last year, the studio had some real success, not to suggest that we didn't have some films that were not successful that we were really disappointed in, but we also had some great success too with the Guardian sequel and Avatar at the end of calendar '22 but part of fiscal '23. One of the things that I've been saying before is that volume sometimes can be detrimental to quality. And in our zeal to greatly increase volume, partially tied to wanting to chase more global subs for our streaming platform. Some of our studios lost a little focus, so the first step that we've taken is that we've reduced volume, we've reduced output, particularly in Marvel. When you fix or when you address these issues with -- in movies, you do three things. You get aggressive at making sure the films you're making can be even better. Sometimes you kill projects you don't believe in. And of course, you put new things in the pipeline that you do believe in that you have much more confidence in. And we're doing all of that. I've also observed over the years that managing creativity sometimes is best done with great partnerships. And I have established great partnerships with the people at our company that really manage their creativity, Alan Bergman with the studio, Dana Walden on the television side, Jimmy Pitaro at ESPN. And the partnership that Alan and I have is a strong one, and we believe that the time that I'm now devoting to this and the attention that the two of us are giving this business not only will bear fruit, but it's already starting to.  We're very bullish about the films coming out. We mentioned Insight Out 2, and we talked about Deadpool and the Planet of the Apes film. We feel good about that. Obviously, the end of the calendar year, we've got Mufasa, prequel to Lion King. We are very excited about the addition of Moana, which is the number one streamed movie of -- across all streamers in the U.S. in '23 and is at over 1 billion hours of consumption on Disney+. And that's now going to be released in November.  And then I mentioned what we're doing after that. I'd say we're leaning a little bit more into sequels and franchises, some that we feel great about, like Toy Story is -- for instance, obviously, Star Wars, Avatar, we've talked about. Marvel is starting to focus on some of its stronger franchises going forward, but I'll leave it at that.  And I think given the environment and given what it takes to get people out of their homes to see a film, doing that, leaning on franchises that are familiar is actually a smart thing. So we've got work to do still. We're not resting on our laurels or sitting on our hands. We're working hard at it, but I feel quite good about the trajectory.\nHugh Johnston : Right. And Steve, from my perspective, regarding Hulu timing on that, we've got a pretty clearly defined process. That process is going to take a little bit of time based on the work that needs to go into valuing the business. I would expect before we get to the end of the year that we should have this figured out and closed. Regarding cost savings, it's pretty well spread out across the board. One of the things you tend to find is when a company goes on a cost effort, once you start to build momentum on that, people tend to find additional opportunities. And that's what gives us the confidence around the numbers to at least meet if not exceed them.  So no one specific area. It's content side as well as the SG&A side. I think we just have momentum on managing our expenses more tightly, which is great news, I think, for investors.\nAlexia Quadrani : Thank you. Operator, next question please?\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Kraft : Hi, good afternoon. Since there's so much discussion about bundling and distribution, I was wondering if I could ask you if you could share any observations related to Charter integrating Disney+ into its pay TV programming tiers. Is there anything you could say about the percentage of customers actually using it or engagement levels relative to the average Disney+ subscriber?  And maybe lastly, do you think that this is a model that you'd like to replicate with other pay TV distributors over time as your agreements come up for renewal? Thanks. \nBob Iger : Thanks, Bryan. It's really early. They didn't start introducing this to their subscribers really until January, and they didn't roll it all out right away. And so we're seeing some stats on this that are somewhat encouraging, but I want to be careful that because it's early, we're not sure whether those trends will continue or not. I do think that this kind of arrangement is one that we'll likely see with other multi-channel distributors. It seemed like it was a win-win for both of us. Important to us, obviously, because it gives us access to more of their customers and important to them in terms of bundling this service with their multichannel customers. So I think it's -- again, I think you'll see more in this direction, but too early yet. We may have more to say about this next quarter when we know a lot more.\nBryan Kraft : Thank you. \nAlexia Quadrani : Operator, we have time for one more question. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next -- our final question today comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nMichael Morris : Thank you. Good afternoon. One follow-up on the sports JV first, and that's how did you comfortable that the availability of the service won't drive accelerated cord-cutting and become an economic drag on your business and the business more broadly? And how do you expect this to impact your renewal discussions with your distribution partners? That's my first. And then my second, Bob, you've seen several iterations of the video game strategy during your tenure. Can you talk a little bit more about why this investment in Epic Games is the right move for you here and what a product might look like and when that may come to market? Thank you. \nBob Iger : Sure. Let me take the second part of the question first. Yes, you're right. We've tried our hand at video games in a number of different directions. And actually, the one that ended up being the most successful for us was the license. And in fact, we've licensed, I think, $9 billion franchises, including the Spider-Man franchise, which is the most successful video game last year. After I came back, I sat down with Josh D\u2019Amaro, who runs our experiences business and his executive who actually manages games, Sean Shoptaw. And one of the things they showed me -- actually, the first thing they showed me were demographic trends. And when I saw Gen Z and Gen Alpha and even millennials and I saw the amount of time they were spending in terms of their total media screen time on video games, it was stunning to me, equal to what they spend on TV and movies. And the conclusion I reached was we have to be there, and we have to be there as soon as we possibly can in a very compelling way.  We knew through our relationship with Fortnite that there was already success when some of our characters and franchises were expressed or showed up in Fortnite. And we knew Tim Sweeney at Epic because we were involved -- he was involved in our Accelerator program, I think in 2017. And so, I met with Tim, and Josh and his team started a discussion about what if we create a gigantic Disney World a la Fortnite that could live next to Fortnite and be completely interconnected with it, a world where people could play games that we create, could create their own games, could watch.  You can imagine the creation of short-form videos or may -- we may even use the platform to actually distribute some of our content, also the people that could interact with one another, and ultimately, some form of shopping as well and other forms of creation. Obviously, there'll be some -- there are the opportunities to buy digital goods, but maybe even at some point, physical goods. And I just think that given the demographic trends and given the success of Fortnite -- and by the way, they're experiencing really a great era of both customer satisfaction and growth as they return to some of their roots. The numbers at Fortnite have been really compelling.  And we just think this is -- just as we take our IP from our movies and our television and have them expressed in our parks, this is a great way to do it in games. And for us, it's a way to have skin in the game with them with the investment of $1.5 billion, strengthen a partnership because we have skin in the game, but also build a world where we're actually not creating too much risk for the company. So as we see it, this is the best of all worlds in many respects from a business venture perspective and certainly great for consumers who love to interact with our characters already in video game format. So I'm actually really thrilled about it. And the second -- or the first part of your first question, accelerating cord-cutting. Understand that we're going to get paid in this new joint venture for our channels at a level that's commensurate with the level that we get paid for those channels in the multi-channel ecosystem. And so if a consumer moves out of that and then into this, then what we get paid for our -- certainly, these channels that are in it is equal to where we get paid there.  We have some other channels that are not part of this new bundle. But frankly, if you look at our company and you look at what we've done with FX on Hulu, with the Disney Channel on Disney+, with National Geographic on Disney+, we're really very well positioned to withstand, basically, the continued challenges that the multi-channel ecosystem will have. And while there might be some de minimis economic impact on us with more cord-cutting for those channels, we're backstopped in all of those channels with the content that exists or that we ultimately put on Hulu and Disney+.  So it's -- for us, it's very low risk and actually, as I talked earlier, potentially quite accretive to us in terms of signing up sports fans that have never signed up for the bundle where they may no longer want it.\nAlexia Quadrani : Okay.
